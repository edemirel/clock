Little Franz was born in the eventful year of 1811,--the \"year of the comet.\" The night of October 21, the night of his birth, the tail of the meteor seemed to light up the roof of the Liszt home and was regarded as an omen of destiny. His mother used to say he was always cheerful, loving, never naughty but most obedient. The child seemed religious by nature, which feeling was fostered by his good mother. He loved to go to church on Sundays and fast days. The <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mass on Christmas eve, when Adam Liszt, carrying a lantern, led the way to church along the country road, through the silent night, filled the child's thoughts with mystic awe. Those early impressions have doubtless influenced the creations of Liszt, especially that part of his \"Christus\" entitled \"Christmas Oratorio.\" Before Franz was six, as we have seen, he had already begun his musical studies. If not sitting at the piano, he would scribble notes--for he had learned...", "...prevailed upon her with much difficulty to return, and take up her quarters with him and his wife and five children in a small tent we had given them. Maddened at the thought of a blow from her son, the old lady about sunset swallowed a large quantity of opium; and before the circumstance was discovered, it was too late to apply a remedy. We were told of it about eight o'clock at night, and found her lying in her son's arms--tried every remedy at hand, but without success, and about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> she died.

They must be here before midday.\" His voice was peremptory, and the natives salaamed respectfully. It was at about an hour before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> that, from the top of his tower, he took a final survey of his surroundings. There was a young moon in the heavens, and by its pale light he observed the figure of one of the guards reclining on the sand, his back against the wall, directly beneath the window of Muriel's room.

By half-past seven in the morning there was not a German soldier left in Nesle, and at half-past nine a British patrol entered, and the women and children surrounded our men, laughing and weeping. To-day they were being fed by British soldiers, and were waiting round the field-kitchens with wistful eyes.

Towards evening, a breeze sprung up directly fair, and filled the sails, which all day had been clinging idly to the masts; and before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we were wafted along at the rate of nine knots an hour, \"while round the waves phosphoric brightness broke,\" the ship seeming, as she cleaved the foam, to draw after her in her wake a long train of stars. Next day, we continued to proceed rapidly, with a fair wind, which we knew would soon bring us to the end of our voyage. The ladies' cabin was now littered with trunks and boxes, brought from the baggage-room that we might select from them such articles as we thought we...", "...chicken's blood, egg, and rice, of which the representatives of each party took a portion, and eat it, or pretended to do so, stating to whom the land belonged.

At Sattamangalam, in the South Arcot district, the festival of the goddess Mariamma is said to be crowned by the sacrifice at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> of a goat, the entrails of which are hung round the neck of the Toti (scavenger), who then goes, stark naked, save for this one adornment, round all the village boundaries. [31] It is recorded by Bishop Whitehead [32] that, in some parts of the Tamil country, e.g., in the Trichinopoly district, at the ceremony for the propitiation of the village boundary goddess, a priest carries a pot containing boiled rice and the blood of a lamb which has been sacrificed to the boundary...", "...rugged path. Its rays fell for a second upon the face of Fontan, and I nearly fell from my perch with amazement. Willi Bernhard, by all that was wonderful! One of the Kaiser's most expert spies, who was head of one of the departments of the Koniggratzer-strasse, posing in Santander as a humble boatman. No wonder I had failed to recognise him until I saw his face! \"No need for me to come any farther,\" said the deep voice of the U-boat captain in German. \"We shall lie here until <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to-morrow, and will expect you at sundown with the latest instructions.

After the baptismal fetes we set out for Italy, accompanied by the Empress Josephine. Whenever it was convenient the Emperor liked to take her with him; but she always desired to accompany her husband, whether or not this was the case. The Emperor usually kept his journey a profound secret up to the moment of his departure, and ordered at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> horses for his departure to Mayence or Milan, exactly as if a hunt at Saint-Cloud or Rambouillet was in question. On one of his journeys (I do not remember which), his Majesty had decided not to take the Empress Josephine. The Emperor was less disturbed by this company of ladies and women who formed her Majesty's suite, than he was by the annoyance of the bandboxes and bundles with which they were usually encumbered, and wished on this occasion to travel rapidly, and...", "...and after I had shown him the audience hall, where these princesses are to meet, he asked me to go and find you--that being easier for me than for him, because none in this palace would be likely to question me, whereas he would be detected instantly and watched, even if not prevented.

Now for our letters;--that to Leclerc modified, as you perceive, by our knowledge of what has passed between him and Henri.\" \"Modified, indeed!\" exclaimed Pascal. Their proceedings were destined to be further modified by the events of this night. Tidings as black as the darkest night that ever brooded over the island in the season of storms poured in to overshadow the prospects of the negroes, and the hopes of their chief. It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when, in the midst of their quiet consultation, Toussaint and his secretary thought they heard voices at the gate. Toussaint was going to ascertain, when he was met in the hall by news that a messenger from the south-west had arrived. The messenger entered, halting and slow. \"It is--no,\" said Pascal; \"surely it cannot be--\" \"Is it possible that you are Jacques?\" exclaimed Toussaint, his eyes shaded by his hand. \"I am Dessalines,\" said the wounded man, who had already...", "...nearly in its primitive condition, and dispense the blessings of their profession to the inhabitants of a country, where the obscure bridle-path, the unbridged water-courses, the deadened forest trees, the ringing of the woodman's axe, the humble log cabin, the homespun dress, and all the many sober, hard realities of pioneer life, attest the youthfulness of the settlement.

Berkeley tried to persuade him to desert Bacon, but he replied that \"if he served the devil he would be true to his trust.\" Berkeley ordered him to be gone within eight hours, but contrary winds sprang up so that he had to delay. This Berkeley thought Carver was glad of, since it gave him an opportunity to wean his soldiers away from him. But it proved a godsend for Berkeley. At about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a message came to him from Captain Larrimore, explaining that he and his crew served under duress, that there were only forty soldiers left on board the _Rebecca_, and that if he could send thirty or forty gentlemen to the ship, he was sure they, with the help of the sailors, could retake her. So Philip Ludwell with two boats went out under cover of darkness. As they approached the ship the soldiers on deck hesitated to fire on them, thinking they were coming at Carver's...", "...but felt perfectly willing and wholly competent to instruct our commanders on the correct way to handle troops. As we pushed on through the underbrush and debris of the forest, the smallest stick trod upon would crack like a rifle-shot, and the unearthly howl of a dog, in the yard of a hut near by, made our hair stand on end as it echoed through the woods. The hours passed tediously as we peered through the darkness across the sluggish stream to the opposite side; but a little after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> movements of the enemy, which they did not try to conceal, awakened our fears; the noise of bodies of men moving from different points, mingled with the sound of voices and frequent shouts, led us to feel that life would be safer and pleasanter behind our battery, when an officer came from the rear and ordered us to come out in a hurry. We didn't stand upon the order of going, but \"got, right smart,\"--not a word of fault was found, nor a complaint made, out of harmony with the...", "...In such an angry sea!\" \"O father!

Ann Harriet was determined that her wedding should be a romantic one; she said that it was by no means an every-day affair, and therefore it should be carried out in a style proportionate to its rarity. After consulting Mrs. Pendergast, and searching through a pile of 'New York Dashers,' she was much inclined to a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> wedding, especially as Mrs. Pendergast offered to loan her patent lamp for the occasion; but when they suddenly happened to hear of a marriage celebrated in the wild and picturesque woods of the White Hills, it was immediately decided that there was no better place; so sacred a ceremony should be performed 'under the broad canopy of heaven,' and the birds of the air and the countless leaves of the trees should sing their epithalamium. After some search, it was decided that...", "...who considered themselves his friends. So the messengers were sent to the other drinking places in town. Word was passed for a night raid \"by representative citizens,\" as these topers called themselves. Men of the same turn of mind soon came flocking in from other drinking resorts. \"Don't talk here about what you're going to do for the good of the town,\" Miller ordered. \"Remember, I've got to be kept out of this. My position is a delicate one, you understand.\" Soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the disreputable army of vengeance seekers was straggling down the road. Talking had ceased. These drink-driven wretches were hunting for the camp of Dick & Co. and they were going to attack it in force.

From within the tent came the sounds of the heavy breathing of the sleepers. \"Everything is ready, and there isn't even a dog on the...", "...deepest part of the channel, over the same ground that the flood had carried us in: we however made sail and beat out, and before dark had made considerable progress; we then lost sight of the land until eleven o'clock when some was seen to the eastward: at half-past eleven we had a dead calm; and, to increase our anxiety, the tide had begun to flow and to drift us towards the land, which was then ascertained to be the group 33, on whose shores the sea was distinctly heard to break. As <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> approached the noise became still more and more plain; but the moon at that time rose and showed that our position was very much more favourable than we had conjectured; for, by bearings of Caffarelli Island and the body of 33 group, I found we were at least two or three miles from the shore of the latter. August 20. A few minutes after midnight we were relieved from our fears by the sudden springing up of a fresh breeze from South-West, and in a moment found ourselves...", "...once--and to avoid detection, I shall remove with my venerable husband to Boston, which I have heard is a charming city, where a woman of fashion and intrigue can lead a glorious and brilliant career.' That night she retired early to rest, and her maid Susan shared her chamber--an arrangement highly satisfactory to the abigail, who was glad of company in a house where ghosts were in the habit of perambulating during the night. Neither mistress nor maid closed an eye in slumber--but <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> came, and they had not seen nor heard anything of a ghostly nature. Yet strange events were taking place in the house,--events which will throw light upon the fearful mysteries of the place. It was about an hour after midnight, when a large stone among those of which the foundation of the house was built, turned slowly upon pivots, revealing an aperture in the wall, and at the same instant the glare of a lantern shone into the cellar. From the aperture emerged two persons...", "...It was delightful to behold, as Proserpina hastened along, how the path grew verdant behind and on either side of her. Wherever she set her blessed foot, there was at once a dewy flower. The violets gushed up along the wayside. The grass and the grain began to sprout with tenfold vigour and luxuriance, to make up for the dreary months that had been wasted in barrenness. The starved cattle immediately set to work grazing, after their long fast, and ate enormously all day, and got up at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to eat more. But I can assure you it was a busy time of year with the farmers, when they found the summer coming upon them with such a rush. Nor must I forget to say that all the birds in the whole world hopped about upon the newly blossoming trees, and sang together in a prodigious ecstasy of joy. Mother Ceres had returned to her deserted home, and was sitting disconsolately on the doorstep, with her torch burning in her hand. She had been idly watching the flame for some...", "...turn, on every side, Dense shades of night the landscape hide, The light of eve is fled: the skies, Thick-studded with their host of eyes, Seem a star-forest overhead, Where signs and constellations spread.

Now, stealing from their lairs, appear The beasts to whom the night is dear.

I abandoned the row-boat, and, after paying the master of the caicco generously, I got into the wherry, made a bargain with the skipper who unfurled three sails, and in less than two hours we were fifteen miles away from Corfu. The wind having died away, I made the men row against the current, but towards <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> they told me that they could not row any longer, they were worn out with fatigue. They advised me to sleep until day-break, but I refused to do so, and for a trifle I got them to put me on shore, without asking where I was, in order not to raise their suspicions. It was enough for me to know that I was at a distance of twenty miles from Corfu, and in a place where nobody could imagine me to be. The moon was shining, and I saw a church with a house adjoining, a long barn opened...", "...while they remain in residence. The undergraduate poet is a not uninteresting study. He wears his hair long, and divides it down the middle. His eye is wild and wandering, and his manner absent, especially when he is called on to translate a piece of an ancient author in lecture. He does not \"read\" much, in the technical sense of the term, but consumes all the novels that come in his way, and all the minor poetry. His own verses the poet may be heard declaiming aloud, at unholy <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hours, so that his neighbours have been known to break his windows with bottles, and then to throw in all that remained of the cold meats of a supper party, without interfering with the divine afflatus. When the college poet has composed a sonnet, ode, or what not, he sends it to the Editor of the Nineteenth Century, and it returns to him after many days. At last it appears in print, in College Rhymes, a collection of mild verse, which is (or was) printed at regular or...", "...the years passed, bringing age upon me, I became often aware of something unseen, yet unmistakably present, in the empty rooms and corridors. Still, it was as I have said many years before I saw any real manifestations of the so-called supernatural. It was not Halloween.

No. It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the morning of the twenty-first day of January. I was sitting reading, as is often my custom, in my study. Pepper lay, sleeping, near my chair. Without warning, the flames of the two candles went low, and then shone with a ghastly green effulgence. I looked up, quickly, and as I did so I saw the lights sink into a dull, ruddy tint; so that the room glowed with a strange, heavy, crimson twilight that gave the shadows behind the chairs and tables a double depth of...", "...men. There were some hummers among the women. The relief at the change from the dismal, deliriously-decorated hotel to this bright, cheery room, was so great that we suddenly grew exceedingly gay and enjoyed ourselves hugely. A little concert afterwards added to the enjoyment, which was only slightly marred by a bill for forty-two shillings. Our homeward journey was through little villages all asleep, and silent as the adjacent churchyards; and as we two tumbled into our cots at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we voted that we had spent \"a fine day\" in spite of the mischievous tendency of things \"to go wrong.\" Another of these \"days\" came later. We had been waiting at Bulford Cottage for three weeks for orders from the war office to leave for France, and we were growing decidedly fidgety. The fine weather feeling of Spring in the air may have had something to do with our restlessness. The buds were swelling on the great trees near by, and the leaves had actually broken from their...", "...to worry you into sleepless nights.\" \"But I have slept--quite a long time,\" was the girl's smiling disclaimer. \"Well, now--let us consider.

I was too busy with my own sad affairs to act the part of a female Paul Pry, even involuntarily.

Genuine passion takes no account of time, and supplies by one instinctive rush of feeling the experience of years. Given the right persons, time becomes as long and as short as eternity. Thus it was with the two lovers who met and parted at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the hilltop. \"There they stood alone. There was no sound or motion in earth or woods or heaven. They might have been the one man and woman for whom this goodly earth that lay at their feet, rimmed with the deepest azure, was created.

The victims were buried with honors, and the German Government issued a statement deploring the \"senseless\" attack. This was one of the few raids made by aviators of the allied powers in which the lives of noncombatants were lost. That it was a warning and not an adopted policy is indicated by the fact that it was not followed up with other raids. Zeppelins were seen off the east coast of England about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on June 16, 1915. They left in their wake one of the longest casualty lists resulting from aerial raids upon England up to that time. South Shields was the principal sufferer. Sixteen persons were killed and forty injured. The Zeppelins devoted their attention to the big Armstrong works principally. Guns and munitions of almost every description were being made there, and the raid was planned to wreck the establishment. This attempt was partially successful, but the buildings...", "...\"That could not have been said to one of your age, Ennia.

The town was in deep silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though Sancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the darkness an excuse for his blundering. All over the place nothing was to be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of Don Quixote and troubled...", "...he meant to sink her. It began snowing the following night and the _Providence_ and _Alfred_ were obliged to separate. Jones was making for Boston when he was discovered by the frigate that he had outwitted two months before, when the _Providence_ narrowly escaped capture. Night was closing in and the frigate being to windward, her outlines were indistinct. Captain Jones ordered his prizes to steer southward and to pay no attention to the signals displayed on his own vessel. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he hoisted a toplight and tacked to the west, knowing the others would continue to the southward as he had directed. The strategem was successful, for at daylight the frigate was pressing hard after the _Alfred_, while the prizes had disappeared. The _Alfred_ eluded her enemy as before, and, upon reaching Boston, Jones found his captives awaiting him. An idea of the effectiveness of the privateers may be gained by the statement that during the year 1777 nearly 500 vessels...", "...Mystery School is far too modest to advertise the fact, he will scorn all titles or honors from men, he will have no regard for riches save the riches of love given to him by those whom it becomes his privilege to help and teach. In the centuries that have gone by since the Rosicrucian Order was first formed they have worked quietly and secretly, aiming to mould the thought of Western Europe through the works of Paracelsus, Boehme, Bacon, Shakespeare, Fludd and others. Each night at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when the physical activities of the day are at their lowest ebb, and the spiritual impulse at its highest flood tide, they have sent out from their temple soul-stirring vibrations to counteract materialism and to further the development of soul powers. To their activities we owe the gradual spiritualization of our once so materialistic science. With the commencement of the twentieth century a further step was taken. It was realized that something must be done to make...", "...an ethereal-looking and fragile slip of a girl, wholly incapable of carrying a scuttle of coals upstairs or of walking five miles without collapsing, can go through an arduous night's exercise, waltzing strong men into a state of coma, without turning a hair.

Consequently it was something like <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when the piano and violin struck up the waltz that she had promised him, and Pip, hastily returning the eldest Miss Calthrop to her base of operations, braced himself for _the_ moment of the evening. He waited for some time at the door of the dancing-room scanning the returning couples, but Elsie did not come; and Pip, who was preeminently a man of action, set out to look for her. He came upon the truant rather suddenly, round a screen at the end of a passage. She was...", "...dream; For, when endowed with necromantic spell, She knows what wondrous things the cake will tell.

Quietly, but quite openly, I took the path by the house, on to the edge of the cliffs, where I could hear every note, every shade of expression; where I could follow the story:--the Russian setting, the summer evening, the beautiful lady, the pealing of the bells calling the worshippers to the chapel for <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mass; the whispered conversations, the organ in solemn chant, the priests intoning the service, the farewell, and, lastly, the lingering chords of the organ fading into the deep silence of slumber. Just as I was about to sit down, I descried the solitary, shadowy outline of a figure seated a few yards away. It was Jake,--poor, old, lonely, battle-scarred Jake. His head was in his hands and he was gazing out to sea as if he were dreaming. I walked over to him and sat by...", "...Gradenigo on the life of his auditor. The felucca, which had been previously provided with the necessary pass by the agents of the police itself, had quitted the port under easy sail by the very inlet through which the gondola made its way into the Adriatic. The water was smooth, the breeze fresh from the land, and in short all things were favorable to the fugitives. Donna Violetta and her governess were leaning against a mast, watching with impatient eyes the distant domes and the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> beauty of Venice. Occasionally strains of music came to their ears from the canals, and then a touch of natural melancholy crossed the feelings of the former as she feared they might be the last sounds of that nature she should ever hear from her native town. But unalloyed pleasure drove every regret from her mind when Don Camillo leaped from the gondola and folded her in triumph to his heart. There was little difficulty in persuading Stefano Milano to abandon for ever the...", "...ways, low vices, and scandals, which in the end could not even be kept out of the newspapers. The day came, in fact, when the worst of these was seized upon by them and filled their sheets with matter which for a whole season decent London avoided reading, and the fast and indecent element laughed, derided, or gloated over. The memory of the fever of the monstrous weeks which had passed at this time was not one it was wise for a man to recall. But it was not to be forgotten--the hasty <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> arrival at Mount Dunstan of father and son, their haggard, nervous faces, their terrified discussions, and argumentative raging when they were shut up together behind locked doors, the appearance of legal advisers who looked as anxious as themselves, but failed to conceal the disgust with which they were battling, the knowledge that tongues were clacking almost hysterically in the village, and that curious faces hurried to the windows when even a menial from the great house...", "...part of the affair with dignity, but without stiffness.

The game, with its intervals of hilarity, was inaugurated in the library, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> it showed no signs of abating. At this hour the original four occupied the table for the second time, and endurance has its limits. The atmosphere of Liberty Hall that prevailed made Honora's retirement easier. \"I'm sure you won't mind if I go to bed,\" she said. \"I've been so used to the routine of--of the chickens.\" She smiled. \"And I've spent the day in the open air.\" \"Certainly, my dear,\" said Mrs. Kame; \"I know exactly how one feels in the country.

And all the while, in the back of his mind, there lingered with a deadly patience the desire for the moment which must inevitably come when he should at last find himself alone, face to face, with Dormer Colville. It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> before this moment came. At last the latest guest had taken his leave, quitting the house by the garden door and making his way across that forlorn and weedy desert by the dim light reflected from the clouds above. At last the Marquis de Gemosac had bidden them good night, and they were left alone in the vast bedroom which a dozen candles, in candelabras of silver blackened by damp and neglect, only served to render more gloomy and mysterious.

No magic and mystery surrounded them, and the dim religious light was the result, not of rich stained glass admitting prismatic streams, but of an obscurity cast by the shadows of Mons Serratus. For great effects one had to go back in imagination to the days when the monks were many and assembled at night for service. It is easy to picture the impressive scene. Beyond the ever-closed screen, within the great choir, a thousand kneeling, penitential figures chanting the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mass, their voices swelling upward in mighty volume; the church just sufficiently lighted to lend the utmost mystery to the occasion; a ghostly hour and a ghostly assemblage of men whose lives have become mere shadows.

For the 30 _sous_, you may drive from one extremity of Paris to the other, provided you do not stop by the way; for every voluntary stoppage is reckoned a _course_. However, if you have far to go, it is better to agree to pay 40 _sous_ per hour, and then you meet with no contradiction.

Whilst the two girls were thus engaged--the one pacing the room and biting her lips with annoyance, the other wrapt in prayer and tears--the step of Cassier was heard on the stairs. It was unfortunate for Charles. He had given loose rein to his passion, and it was at this moment beyond control. The scene reminds us of a poor wife, the hapless victim of a drunkard's home, drawing on herself brutal treatment, when, in the lonely hours of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and in the pent-up feelings of a breaking heart, she would incautiously reprove the maddened retch who is reeling home to her under the fumes of intoxication; thus Charles gave vent to feelings she had long nursed in her bosom, and spoke in disrespectful language of reproof to her intoxicated father. Cassier had come from the carousals of the lodge. The fumes of the old wines had reached his brain; the fearless and unexpected reproof of Charles startled him. In an instant...", "...it.

So he went without stopping to the top of a mountain, where Fionn stood alone. Diarmid asked if he was hunting, and Fionn said no, but that after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a company of Fenians had come out, and one of the hounds had crossed the track of the wild boar of Ben Gulbain, which had slain thirty Fenians that morning.

Once the plague-stricken city lay behind him, his journey was short; and soon, to his great delight, he turned into the silent deserted by-path leading to the ruin. Tying his horse to a stake in the crumbling wall, he paused for a moment to look at it in the pale, wan light of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> moon. He had looked at it many a time before, but never with the same interest as now; and the ruined battlements, the fallen roof, the broken windows, and mouldering sides, had all a new and weird interest for him.

With more haste, but the same precaution, he descended, and passed through...", "...of coroner, magistrate, police, or jury. But they searched in vain.

Then he had studied the procedure of the court, and the penalties assigned. At first he could not believe what he read.

As she thought that men were there she procured a revolver, and, standing in the lighted window, called out, \"If you do not leave I'll shoot.\" There was no answer, so she fired, and there was a scurrying of feet to another clump of trees. Again she called out and as there was no reply she fired a second and a third time, and then the...", "...had been filled with wounded, and sent out. Yet at that hour more than five hundred wounded men still lay on their stretchers on the grass outside.

[Sidenote: The hospital floors are crowded.] But, grace to heaven, the Germans did not come that night! At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I went into Ward 4, where some of the worst wounded had been placed. Stretchers had been laid on top of the beds and flat on the floor on both sides of the central aisle, till one could hardly move. Most of the wounded seemed to sleep. Only here and there one begged for water, and these men were usually wounded in the abdomen where not even water could be given. We could moisten their lips and wipe off the hot feverish faces, and that was all. [Sidenote: Everything possible...", "...Only the husbands were left behind with Sotu. The queen had retired.

It was two hours past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> now, and the citizens, with the exception of the guards and the male revellers, were long since asleep. A lovely night for a drive, for young people particularly. Only the roaring of the confined beasts, with the calling of the frogs in the papyrus reeds, could be heard.

Then we called to the old olive-tree yonder, asking how soon the midnight hour would come; but all the old olive-tree answered was \"Presently, presently,\" and finally we, too, fell asleep, wearied by our long watching, and lulled by the rocking...", "...corresponding numbers of aerolitic falls. On the other hand, it is obvious that fire-balls, unless of very extraordinary magnitude, would not be visible during the day. The _observed_ number will therefore be greatest when the nights are longest; that is, when the earth is near its perihelion. This, it will be found, is precisely in accordance with observation. It has been found, moreover, that a greater number of meteoric stones fall during the first half of the day, that is, from <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to noon, than in the latter half, from noon to midnight. This would seem to indicate that a large proportion of the aerolites encountered by the earth have direct motion. _Height of the Atmosphere._--The weight of a given volume of mercury is 10,517 times that of an equal volume of air at the earth's surface; and since the mean height of the mercurial column in the barometer is about thirty inches, if the atmosphere were of uniform density its altitude would be about 26,300...", "...in the proper direction, ought to have been practically and closely examined, not merely viewed at a distance in a foggy atmosphere.

But to proceed: about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the 19th of August, the sound described by Baffin to be the largest of all the sounds he discovered, and called by him Sir Thomas Smith's Sound, was distinctly seen; and the two capes which formed its entrance were called by Captain Ross after the two ships Isabella and Alexander. \"I considered,\" he informs us, \"the bottom of this sound to be about eighteen leagues distant, but its entrance was completely blocked up by ice.\" Here again, a sound which seemed to promise fair...", "...Thither I resolved forthwith to repair; but the light was of use merely to enable me to read the book. I knew the shelf and the spot where it stood. Whether I took down the book, or prepared the lamp in the first place, appeared to be a matter of no moment. The latter was preferred, and, leaving my seat, I approached the closet in which, as I mentioned formerly, my books and papers were deposited. Suddenly the remembrance of what had lately passed in this closet occurred. Whether <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> was approaching, or had passed, I knew not. I was, as then, alone, and defenceless. The wind was in that direction in which, aided by the deathlike repose of nature, it brought to me the murmur of the water-fall. This was mingled with that solemn and enchanting sound, which a breeze produces among the leaves of pines. The words of that mysterious dialogue, their fearful import, and the wild excess to which I was transported by my terrors, filled my imagination anew. My steps...", "...have learned that soothing song, And with its heavenly music speed the days and nights along; So through all time, whose flight the Shepherd's vigils glorify, God's Acre slumbereth in the grace of that sweet lullaby,-- \"Sleep, oh, sleep!

This letter said: Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend.

Often in the middle of the night she would set up that sonorous lamentation and continue it till sleep was chased from every eye in the household. This generally had the effect of bringing the object of her affection before her, but in a mood anything but filial or comforting. Still, at such times a kick seemed a comfort to her, and she would gladly have kissed the rod that was the instrument of my <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> wrath. But her tender star was destined soon to a fatal eclipse. Being tied with too long a rope on one occasion during my temporary absence, she got her head into the meal barrel, and stopped not till she had devoured nearly half a bushel of dry meal.

The night was very dark, the officers being unable to find the road, wandering around in the woods, marching in swamps and ditches, sometimes up to their knees in mud; occasionally a man fell down and was pulled out by his comrades; marching on an old corduroy road, that for some time had been useless; the rain poured in torrents; each man marching for himself and on his own hook. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> Culpepper was reached, having marched twelve miles, the correct distance being but four miles; the men halted in the woods, building fires of brush to keep warm and to dry themselves.

The rippling of the stream close by, the whispering of the leaves stirred by the night wind, the chirrup of cicadas, the occasional cry of some wild creature, are but the natural voices of the nocturnal forest.

About the middle of the same century, the Jews were one day seen waiting at their windows, expecting the arrival of their Messiah; an Israelite, named Avenar, having announced his coming. Cardan predicted a long and glorious reign to Edward VI, King of England; who nevertheless died in his sixteenth year! CHAPTER XXVI. THE MOON AND LUNAR INFLUENCE. From the stars in general to the moon in particular, there is but a step; nor will we separate the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> luminary from the company in which we usually find her. Lovers and poets have from time immemorial found solace in her beams; while the early philosophers pretended that she swallowed stones in the manner of the mountebanks, in order to cast them down upon us in the form of aerolites. This conclusion is as absurd as a thousand others, of which the moon has been the object. The ingenuousness of the old lady, who on hearing continually of new moons, inquired anxiously what...", "...heard her light tread coming along the gravel he approached swiftly, though with anything but menace in his manner. The darkness was so intense that it was not easy to discover forms within the shadows of the woods at the distance of twenty feet, and quite impossible to distinguish persons until near enough to touch them. The young Huron manifested disappointment when he found whom he had met; for, truth to say, he was expecting his favourite, who had promised to relieve the ennui of a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> watch with her presence. This man was also ignorant of English, but he was at no loss to understand why the girl should be up at that hour. Such things were usual in an Indian village and camp, where sleep is as irregular as the meals. Then poor Hetty's known imbecility, as in most things connected with the savages, stood her friend on this occasion. Vexed at his disappointment, and impatient of the presence of one he thought an intruder, the young warrior signed for the girl...", "...help, and at the same moment men's angry voices were heard. The pair had been attacked by three men who had apparently been lying hidden in the wood. I heard a man shout, and then a sharp crack like that of a whip. The Kaiser's son was shouting, too, while the girl was screaming and crying shame upon those who had attacked the man with whom she had been walking. \"You infernal German!\" I heard one of the men shriek. \"I'll teach you to come sneaking here and take my sister out for <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> walks! Take that--you cur--and that!--whoever you are!\" Next second the startling truth was plain to me. His Imperial Highness the German Crown-Prince was being ignominiously and soundly thrashed by an irate brother! I saw that it was high time that I interfered. The Crown-Prince had been flung upon the ground, and the angry young man was lashing him as I dashed in among them with my revolver drawn. \"Come, cease that,\" I shouted. \"Down with that whip. You've attacked...", "...appropriated to the Horsinghams. Since then the ghost has been less troublesome; but most of the family have seen or heard it at least once in their lives. I confess that if ever I lie awake at Dangerfield till the clock strikes twelve I invariably stop my ears and bury my head under the bedclothes for at least a quarter of an hour. By these means I have hitherto avoided any personal acquaintance with the spectre; but nothing on earth would induce me to walk down that corridor at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and risk a private interview with the Dangerfield ghost! CHAPTER X. As for spending a whole morning in the drawing-room with the ladies it is what I cannot and will not submit to. Working and scandal, scandal and working, from half-past ten till two is more than I can stand, so the very first morning I was at Dangerfield I resolved to break the chain at once, and do as I always meant to do for the future. Accordingly, immediately after breakfast I popped my bonnet...", "...never had heard of its being so; but my own coachman having left me at the palace that day, and not hearing of me for some time, had driven home, and, fearing that my not returning arose from something which had happened, advised him to go to the Pont Royal and hear what he could learn, as there was a report of many persons having been murdered and thrown over the bridge. My man took the advice, and armed himself to be ready in case of attack. It was between one and two o'clock after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when he went. The first objects he perceived were these miscreants attempting to scale the palace. He told me that the Queen had been most grossly insulted; that the gates of the Tuileries had been shut in consequence; that a small part alone remained open to the public, who were kept at their distance by a national ribbon, which none could pass without being instantly arrested. This had prevented his apprising the Princess of the attempt which he had accidentally...", "...FROM CENTRAL STATIONS Large dynamos generate electricity very much more cheaply than small machines can, and machines which have a full load continually produce the current very much more cheaply than those which run upon very light load part of the time. The largest central stations with load evenly distributed for the whole day could furnish electricity profitably at four cents per kilowatt hour. There are many small electric lighting plants which furnish current from sundown to <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> only at fifteen cents per kilowatt hour, with little profit. The transformer (Fig. 127) makes it possible to gather all this generation of electricity for sparsely settled districts into large central stations, located sometimes far away from the consumer perhaps, where there is abundant power in some water-fall, thus saving the expense of coal for running the dynamos.

But it was always starvation times with them; and when aroused, the temper and tongue of Mrs. Watts was more than the peaceful old man could stand up against. And as there were a dozen other tots of her age in the factory, he had been forced to acquiesce. Long after all others had retired--long after the evening star had arisen, and now, high overhead, looked down through the chinks in the roof of the cabin on the mountain side, saying it was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and past, the patient old man sat with Shiloh on his lap, watching her quick, restless breathing, and fearing to put her to bed, lest he might awaken her. He put her in bed at last and then slipped into Captain Tom's cabin before he himself lay down. To his surprise he was up and reading an old dictionary--studying and puzzling over the words. It was the only book except the Bible the Bishop had in his cabin, and this book proved to be Captain Tom's solace. After...", "...for he danced on without answering. At an hour after that of midnight the revelers came home and left me at my gate, by request, to walk alone in the brilliant spring moonlight through my garden to the wide door back of the white pillars. After they had seen me safely started, they glided away and I stood on the steps and watched Nell and Mark reclaim their family from a tall dark figure that carried out two loads to the parental arms. Then the hush that comes upon the world in the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hours fell over the Poplars and I stood leaning against one of the tall pillars and reveled in it. Goodloets is one of the tradition-grayed old towns that are rooted deep in the Harpeth Valley since the days of the Colonies, and in it can be found perhaps the purest Americanism on the American continent.

A further Order laid down that from 6 p.m. on the 24th the Australians should not only hold their fire, but should also refrain from displaying periscopes above the parapets. Proceeding, it stipulated that the enemy was to be allowed to show himself, but this latter provision subsequently gave way to an imperative injunction that no opportunity of killing a Turk was to be missed. This period of inactivity was continued until <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the 27th November, and was facetiously termed the \"close season for Turkey.\" In the early portion, the unusual quietness on our side had a weird effect. The enemy continued his ordinary activity for a time and then audibly slackened, only to resume again later on. At night time he sent over patrols to investigate, but these were not allowed to return. A story was told of a solitary individual crossing over from the opposite lines and quietly removing some filled sandbags...", "...many expenses to meet, and benefits without number to bestow. Permit me, I entreat you, to render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. When the king and queen were beheaded, she secretly wore black for them. Also, she made a trip to England, where she tried to sell some of her jewels to help the royalist cause. All these things were duly repeated to the revolutionary government by Louis Zamore, her Bengalese servant. One evening she was expecting a visit from Cosse. But <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> came, and he had not appeared. \"Go down the road,\" she ordered Zamore, who had just returned from an errand to Paris, \"and see if you can catch sight of him.\" \"I can show him to you--or part of him--without troubling to do that,\" retorted Zamore, with sudden insolence. Whipping one hand from behind his back, he tossed on the floor at Marie's feet the head of her lover. Cosse had been guillotined that day. Zamore, in return for certain information to the government, had...", "...remembered seeing the poor Curate of St. Pancras after the same journey into Switzerland a year or two ago. His head was plastered and bandaged, and he, poor fellow, looked a sorry pickle after the burglary and attempted murder, but was it not a splendid subject for a sermon when he found himself at Chamounix and able to preach! And did he not profit by the unusual opportunity! In thinking of this we each said our prayers quietly, when we fancied the other was not looking, and towards <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we wound up our watches, which we understand are seldom remembered by travellers on night journeys. At this stage of the narrative it seems highly desirable to describe ourselves, and we hasten to prove a total absence of any reluctance: No. 1 is a slim youth just over twenty, with a delicate complexion and curly hair, but whose digestion is atrocious, frequently causing his normally amiable character to be tinged with viciousness, and No. 2 is ten years older and the...", "...fear about entering the kingdom of heaven since Joe Ridder managed to get that particular thread through the eye of that particular needle! But when a boy is put at a work-bench at twelve years of age and does the same thing day in and day out for seven long years, he may have lost all of the things that youth holds dear, but one thing he is apt to have learned, a dogged, plodding, unquestioning patience that shoves silently along at the appointed task until the work is done.

The effect of Joe's efforts were prompt and satisfactory. The next day being Sunday, he spent the major part of it in passing and repassing the house on...", "...putting each down in disgust. Philosophy fails to hold her attention--poetry annoys her; fiction--the book of the moment, which happened to be \"The Damnation of Theron Ware,\" makes her wince, and so she reaches under the reading stand, and brings out from the bottom of a pile of magazines a salacious novel filled with stories of illicit amours. This she reads until her cheeks burn and her lips grow dry and she hears the roll of a buggy down the street, and knows that it must be nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and that her mate is coming. She slips the book back into its place of concealment, picks up \"The Harmonious Universe,\" and walks with some show of grandeur in her trailing garments down the stairs to greet her lord. \"You up?\" he asks. He glances at the book and continues: \"Reading that damn trash? Why don't you read Browning or Thackeray or--if you want philosophy Emerson or Carlyle? That's rot.\" He puts what scorn he can into the word rot, and in her sweetest, falsest,...", "...his interests in your hands, and I trust no harm will befall him.\" Washington shook hands with both lads, and spoke a word of farewell. Then he joined the gentlemen who were waiting for him, and an aid shortly conducted Nathan and Godfrey to another apartment of the State-House. Here they remained three hours, at the end of which time Cornelius De Vries returned to announce his complete success. The town was now quiet, and the lads safely reached South Street wharf. It was not quite <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when they parted from the old Hollander and went on board the sloop \"Speedswift,\" and when they came on deck in the morning, after a good night's rest, the vessel was many miles down the Delaware. No British men-of-war were met with, but, owing to bad weather, the voyage was prolonged to nearly a week--a delay that sorely tried Nathan's patience. At last, one dark and sultry July night, the \"Speedswift\" entered the mouth of the Shrewsbury, and sailed cautiously along the...", "...\"At Rechamp, too?\" She relapsed into indifference. \"I haven't been as far as Rechamp.\" \"But you must have seen people who'd been there--you must have heard.\" \"I've heard the masters were still there--so there must be something standing. Maybe though,\" she reflected, \"they're in the cellars....\" We continued to jog on through the dusk. V \"There's the steeple!\" Rechamp burst out. Through the dimness I couldn't tell which way to look; but I suppose in the thickest <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he would have known where he was. He jumped from the trap and took the old horse by the bridle. I made out that he was guiding us into a long village street edged by houses in which every light was extinguished. The snow on the ground sent up a pale reflection, and I began to see the gabled outline of the houses and the steeple at the head of the street. The place seemed as calm and unchanged as if the sound of war had never reached it. In the open space at the end of the...", "...positive at first, but whether he has talked himself into the belief that the corpse is that of the young lady's visitor, or whether it really does resemble him so much as to give the boy grounds for thinking so, I can't make out.\" \"I see, however, that _you_ believe the murdered man to be Mrs. Atkins's friend, of whose history and whereabouts she was so strangely ignorant.\" \"Well, I don't know,\" the detective replied. \"We have found out that an Allan Brown did engage a berth on the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> train to Boston.\" \"Really? Why, I was sure that Allan Brown was a creation of the little lady's imagination. By the way, it is a strange coincidence that two mysterious Allans are connected with this case.\" \"Yes, I have thought of that,\" the detective murmured; \"and Allan is no common name, either. But it is a still stranger circumstance that neither of Allan Brown nor of the murdered man (I am now taking for granted that they are not identical) can we discover the...", "...a man's while to carry home a piece of this bridge!\" he muttered to himself. He tried the rivets, he shook the railing. At last he found four loose bolts which he was able to pull out. The four together were so heavy that he was scarcely able to lift them. He looked cautiously about and when he saw that no one was looking, he slipped them one by one into the bottom of his wagon and covered them with straw. Then he turned his horse's head and drove home as fast as he could. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when he got there and nobody about to spy on him as he hid the silver bolts in the hay. The next day when he went out alone to gloat over his treasure he found instead of four heavy silver bolts four pieces of wood! So that's what the rich brother got for following the silver tracks. A day or two later without saying a word to any one, the second brother decided that he would follow the silver tracks and have a look at the strange Beggar whose cart had silver bolts and...", "...be too set up about it: I think her curiosity about your family is responsible,--these fake newspaper stories about your sister--which is it, Hermione or Gwendolen--who is always about to marry a count.

Wherever there is the fear of death and of judgment, there is, and must be poetry--and when was that feeling more intensely developed than during that dim period? The victims of a spell are objects of poetical interest. Here was a strong spell, embracing a world. Was no arm during the dark ages bared aloft in defense of outraged innocence? Or was no head then covered with the snows of a hundred winters, through one <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> despair? Was the voice of prayer then stifled throughout Europe's hundred lands? Was the mighty heart of man--the throbbing of which is just poetry, then utterly silent? But it was not expressed! We maintain, on the contrary, that it was--expressed at the time, in part by monks, and scalds, and orators, and expressed afterward in the glad energy of the spring which human nature made from its trance, into new life and motion.

Then Ali handed the Count a sealed letter, making signs to the effect that he had found it tied with a cord to one of the palm trees on the lawn. Monte-Cristo opened the letter and glanced at the signature; as he did so a look of surprise and annoyance settled upon his face. The note was written in the French language, and read as follows: COUNT OF MONTE-CRISTO: I am in hiding on the Island of Salmis and must see you without delay.

The little Alpine hamlet was sufficiently familiar with the storms of autumn and of spring, and its inhabitants were wont to sleep calmly and quietly while the wind raged above the low stone-laden roofs and rattled at the doors and windows. But to-night the uproar was so terrible that it roused them from their repose. They crossed themselves and lay awake listening; it seemed as if Saint Michael were...", "...and a maid; we sent my man to the village to hurry up the firemen, and then I flew back to you, dearest, knowing you would be anxious as to your uncle.

Christianity in that time and in a new country was required sometimes to be of a stalwart and muscular kind, that it might meet evil tendencies sharply and effectively. Thus we learn of the discomfitures of a gang of rowdies from Linn Grove, who invaded the peace of Mt. Vernon and disturbed its Sabbath quietude, with intent to break up a religious meeting then in progress. These were overcome, after a tussle, by the worshippers, and held until passing of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> brought a civic day. Then the justice was roused, the disturbers formally accused, tried and fined to the utmost extent of their resources.

But in the very midst of these feelings I sought the society of friends, and endeavored around the social board to exhilarate my senses and drown these undesirable fancies. Life seemed more secure among friends, but death was not to be dodged. It caught me unarmed and alone at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in the very doorway of my house. I had crossed the threshold, and remember trying to find the stairs and being seized with a dizziness. The place seemed to spin around and I felt that I was falling. Next, a great weight seemed to press me down like some horrid nightmare. I endeavored to groan, to cry out and struggle from under it, but it held me fast. After this I seemed to be falling backward through a blackness--an inky blackness. It came close to me, and pressed close...", "...lowland country between the two empires lie (to my way of thinking) some of the most fertile fields of prose--fiction that expresses feeling and character and setting rather than action and plot; fiction beautifully ripened by the lingering mild sunshine of the essayist's mood. This is fiction, I might add, extremely unlikely to get into the movies. I think of short stories such as George Gissing's, in that too little known volume _The House of Cobwebs_, which I read again and again at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> with unfailing delight; fall asleep over; forget; and again re-read with undiminished satisfaction. They have no brilliance of phrase, no smart surprises, no worked-up 'situations' which have to be taken at high speed to pass without breakdown over their brittle bridgework of credibility.

It may be severely...", "...he lived. As it was, he knew not what to think. He remembered the character which had been whispered abroad about Harry Woodward, and of his intercourse with supernatural beings--he was known to possess the Evil Eye; and it was generally understood that those who happened to be endowed with that accursed gift were aided in the exercises of it by the powers of darkness and of evil. What, then, was he to do? There probably was an opportunity of solving the mystery which hung around the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> motions of Woodward. If there was a spirit before him, there was also a human being, in living flesh and blood--an acquaintance, too--an individual whom he personally knew, ready to sustain him, and afford, if necessary, that protection which, under such peculiar circumstances, one fellow-creature has a right to expect from another. Now Barney's way home led him necessarily--and a painful necessity it was--near the Haunted House; and he observed that the place where they...", "...in a canter, and--' Two shots were heard in quick succession.

At all seasons of the year, and under all circumstances, this duty was never omitted. Even in sickness, if his strength failed him, his head was bowed on a tray of earth, to mark his dutiful recollection of the several hours appointed for prayer. The Psalmist's language has often been realized to my view, in him, 'Seven times a day do I praise thee, O Lord,' and 'at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I will rise to give thanks unto Thee,' when witnessing his undeviating observance of stated prayer duties; and when those duties were accomplished, even his amusements were gleaned from devotional works, visits of charity, and acts of benevolence. I never saw him idle; every moment was occupied in prayer or in good works. His memory was retentive, and every anecdote he related was a lesson calculated to lead the mind of his auditor to seek, trust, and obey God, or to love our...", "...you.\" He slid into the vacant chair and his fingers began to move over the keyboard.

Bessie Watson was terrified by the fearful aspect of Mr. Fairfield when he entered the room, and for weeks the awful expression upon his face haunted her like the vision of a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> ghost.

When he was ailing, he was subject to fainting fits; but he had never appeared so badly as on the present occasion. The miser trusted no person, had no confidence in any one, not even in his wife. He had not told her that he had four thousand dollars in gold in the house, for he feared that she might be tempted to rob him of his treasure....", "...Whitley, with his age and experience, was most useful now in restraining the impatient young men.

Their favorite object was the plunder of a certain church on one of the Spanish islands, which they proposed to assail during the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mass of Christmas, whereby a triple end would be achieved: first, a rich booty; secondly, the punishment of idolatry; thirdly, vengeance on the arch-enemies of their party and their faith.

I had been spending the evening alone in my library making notes for a second volume of my memoirs, and, feeling somewhat depressed, I was on the point of going out for my usual <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> walk on Hampstead Heath, when one of my servants, hastily entering, informed me of the robbery. I changed my mind in respect to my midnight walk immediately upon receipt of the news, for I knew that before one o'clock some one would call upon me at my lodgings with reference to this robbery. It could not be otherwise.

That unfortunate mountain had recklessly expended its volcanic energies in early life, and was now left without a voice to answer the thundering shouts of its mighty comrade. There was a time when volcanoes were as numerous in Kamchatka as knights around the table of King Arthur, and the peninsula trembled to the thunder of their shoutings and <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> jollity; but one after another they had been suffocated with the fiery streams of their own eloquence, until at last Kluchefskoi was left alone, calling to its old companions throughout the silent hours of long winter nights, but hearing no response save the faint far-away echoes of its own mighty voice.

Everything happened up to <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> just as it had to Roland. Sir John heard only the vague rustling and passing noises of the night. Midnight sounded; it was the moment he awaited with impatience, for it was then that something would happen, if anything was to happen.

Owing to our exposed position, we had to withdraw our guns by hand to the rear, where the ground formed a sort of ravine. At this time, Rickett's Pennsylvania battery, and Ames' New York battery, opened from our left. Our battery fired sixty rounds. We had one man wounded, Burrill,--a detached infantry man,--a cannon ball breaking his arm. Shortly after we retired to our former position.

He had decided to say nothing about the incident which, so far as he could see, concerned only himself, and so when the men on guard questioned him about the shots that they had heard he told them that he had been firing at a mark. This was quite true, even if the mark had been invisible. Shad Wells was off duty until <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> so Peter went the rounds, calling the men to the guardhouse and telling them of the change in the orders. They were to wait until the company upon the portico went indoors and then, with Jesse in command, they were to take new stations in trees and clumps of bushes which Peter designated much nearer the house.

Here they lay down to sleep, but towards <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> were alarmed by an earthquake which shook the whole edifice. Thor rising up called on his companion to seek with him a place of safety. On the right they found an adjoining chamber, into which the others entered, but Thor remained at the doorway with his mallet in his hand, prepared to defend himself, whatever might happen.

So stood the Dean erect, with one hand pressed against the table for support, while the Mariposa fire bell struck out its warning to the sleeping town,--stood there while the street grew loud with the tumult of voices,--with the roaring gallop of the fire brigade,--with the harsh note of the gong--and over all other sounds, the great seething of the flames that tore their way into the beams and rafters of the pointed church and flared above it like a torch into the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sky. So stood the Dean, and as the church broke thus into a very beacon kindled upon a hill,--sank forward without a sign, his face against the table, stricken. You need to see a fire in a place such as Mariposa, a town still half of wood, to know what fire means. In the city it is all different. To the onlooker, at any rate, a fire is only a spectacle, nothing more. Everything is arranged, organized, certain. It is only once perhaps in a century that fire comes to a...", "...with which the Jesuits had absolutely nothing to do. The people of the city were discussing the relative merits of the Pestalozzi and Lancaster systems for primary teaching; and to restore peace, the town council, at the bishop's request, closed all the schools. This drew down the public wrath on the head of the bishop, but as reverence for his official position protected him from open attack, someone suggested that the Jesuits were at the back of the measure. The result was that, at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on March 9, 1823, a mob attacked the Jesuit college, and clamored for its destruction. The bishop, however, wrote a letter assuming complete responsibility for the measure and the trouble then ceased. After the fall of Napoleon, Talleyrand suggested to Louis XVIII to recall the Jesuits for collegiate work. But before his majesty had succeeded in making up his mind, the proposition became known and Talleyrand was driven from power in spite of a proclamation which he issued,...", "...grave carriage. Everybody, however, looked with greater admiration on Eva, because she danced with heart and soul. Gabriele, with her golden curls, flew round like a butterfly. But who did not dance this evening?--Everybody was actually enthusiastic--for all were infected with the joyous animal spirits of Henrik. Even Jeremias Munter, to the amazement of everybody, led Eva, with most remarkable skill, through the Polska,[4] the most artificial and perplexing of dances. It was only at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> that the dance was discontinued, at the suggestion of Elise. But before they separated, the Judge begged his wife to sing the well-known little song--\"The First Evening in the New House.\" She sang it in her simple, soul-touching manner, and the joy full of peace which this song breathed penetrated every heart; even the grave countenance of the Judge gleamed with an affectionate emotion.

It was now near <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when they reached a house in which, through a lattice, they could perceive three girls with their mother eating a slender meal; during which, at intervals, one of them sung, and the other two laughed and talked. The sultan resolved to enter the house, and commanded the vizier to knock at the door, which he did; when one of the sisters cried out, \"Who knocks at our door at this advanced time of night?\" \"We are two foreign dervishes,\" replied the vizier; to which the ladies...", "...amused herself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hot-house flowers, and by the time the song was concluded the nosegay lay in ruins on the floor.

My chamber was in the old part of the mansion, the ponderous furniture of which might have been fabricated in the days of the giants.

The bed was of rich though faded damask, with a lofty tester, and...", "...from her embarrassing situation.

A great many of his men-at-arms did, as those on the watch observed, enter one by one into the town. The people of Worcester were somewhat surprised at this large accompaniment of the earl, but thought no harm. The Abbess of St. Anne's, however, was greatly terrified, as she feared that some evil design might be intended against her. She was, however, reassured in the evening by a message brought by a boy, to the effect that succor would be near, whatsoever happened.

A party of men fell upon the burgesses guarding the gate of the town, disarmed them, and took possession of it. At the same time those who had put up at the hostelry with Sir Rudolph suddenly mounted their horses, and with a great clatter rode down the streets to the convent of St. Anne. Numbers of men on foot also joined, and some sixty in all suddenly appeared before the great gate of the convent.

A shower could easily have quenched the beacons I was seeking, and my vigil soon became tedious; so presently I followed the others and turned in, rather disconsolate and disgusted. Toward <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the wind fell rapidly, and within half an hour we found ourselves in a dead calm, when the moan of the breakers was quite audible on our starboard quarter. The Captain was nervous and watchful; the currents in the channel were strong, and he saw, by the variation in the compass, that the vessel was being whirled in a great circle around a point of the island.

Worn out with nerve-racking thoughts, as well as with the cruel monotony of the past four hours, Gilda felt her soul and body numb and lifeless as a stone.

Maria still snored unperturbed, and Gilda, wide-eyed and with beating heart, awaited further...", "...of the room held a desk, and was strown with papers, magazines, etc.; while soft chairs inviting one to luxurious ease faced the ruddy hearth, and various little nick-nacks scattered here and there showed the graceful touch of a woman's hand. Going to the centre table, Aunt Judith seated herself before the open desk, looked over several closely-written sheets of manuscript, and then furnishing herself with fresh paper, began to write rapidly. The fire burned slowly out, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour had long sounded ere Miss Latimer dried her pen and laid aside her work with a tired sigh. Crossing to the window, she raised the blind, and leaning against the casement, looked away up at the quiet night sky. There was no moon; but the happy stars, shining with frosty brightness, kept their silent watch over the sleeping world. Oh, how still, how very hushed it was! what a great infinite peace seemed brooding over all--a peace such as millions of weary souls were...", "...Caesar had returned from Germany and Gaul having played his part of mountebank upon the arena of the world. Eaten up with senseless and cynical vanity, Caius Julius Caesar Caligula desired to be the Caesar of his army as he was princeps and imperator, high pontiff and supreme dictator of the Empire. But as there was no war to conduct, no rebellion to subdue, he had invented a war and harassed some barbarians who had no thought save that of peace. He stage-managed conspiracies and <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> attacks, drilling his own soldiers into acting the parts of malcontents, of escaped prisoners, of bloodthirsty barbarians, the while he himself--as chief actor in the play--vanquished the mock foes and took from them mock spoils of war. Then he upbraided Rome for her inertia whilst he, the Emperor, confronted dangers and endured hardships for her sake. His letters, full of glowing accounts of his supposed prowess, of the ferocity of the enemy, of the fruits of victory...", "...Hull, on whom the command devolved for a short time, when the state of Colonel Burr's health compelled him to retire. These measures, together with the deportment of Colonel Burr, gained him the love and veneration of all devoted to the common cause, and conciliated even its bitterest foes. His habits were a subject of admiration. His diet was simple and spare in the extreme. Seldom sleeping more than an hour at a time, and without taking off his clothes, or even his boots. Between <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and two o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two or three of his corps of horsemen, he visited the quarters of all his captains, and their picket-guards, changing his route from time to time to prevent notice of his approach. You may judge of the severity of this duty, when I assure you that the distance which he thus rode every night must have been from _sixteen_ to _twenty-four_ miles; and that, with the exception of two nights only, in which he was otherwise engaged, he...", "...day the maidens sought to lighten our burden of gloom; the sports in the bath were more brilliant than usual. We adjourned to the hay-loft and told stories till our very tongues were tired. It is true that egg-nogg at intervals consoled us; but when we had awakened from a refreshing sleep among the hay, and fought a battle that ended in victory for the Amazons and our ignominious flight, we bore the scars of burr and hay-seed for hours afterwards. Cold turkey and cranberry sauce at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> had been promised to us, yet how very distant that seemed. Hunger cried loudly for beef and bouillon, and a strategic movement was planned upon the spot. The gaming, which followed a slim supper, was not so interesting as usual. At intervals we consulted the clock; how the hours lagged! Croesus poured his gold upon the table in utter distraction. The maidens, who sat in sack-cloth and ashes, sorrowing for our sins, left the room at intervals to assure themselves that the...", "...as the great, great sea, in mighty waves.

As he lay there, his tired body resting with the very act of lying down, he grew gradually more drowsy, and he drifted off asleep at last with the humming of a power boat on the lake beating against his ears. He slept a long time. The camp was quiet. In the distance an owl hooted now and then, and until long after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the sounds of activity persisted on the lake. The moon had risen early, and was setting soon after midnight, so that it was very dark under the trees, though out on the lake, once the shadow of the trees around the shore was passed, the stars gave abundant light.

I knew that if the cyclonic scope was general, ships were having trouble, but in that thought lurked a vague hope. If any power were to drive a vessel to my rescue it would be a power which carried sailors out of their ordered courses. One night, some six months after the wreck of the _Wastrel_, when the skies were serene again I found myself more than ordinarily adrift on the tide of imagination. The march of the stars showed that <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> had passed, and yet the natives sat unhurried, and I, as unhurried as they, was still absorbed with the violin. My eyes traveled out to sea, absently and without reason. Suddenly the bow stopped half-way across the strings with a rasping gasp of the catgut. The instrument itself fell from my hands and I sat rigid and staring like a man suddenly stricken. The other eyes followed mine and also remained riveted.

To have had a real skirmish with a wolf, a panther, or even a tiger, would have been less distasteful to the English officer than soothing the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> fancies of the dismayed household, or escaping from the unwelcome attentions of Kathleen's pet lizard, which had left its favourite retreat behind the pictures in the dining-room for a midnight stroll in the veranda. *CHAPTER VI.* _*AWAY TO THE HILLS.*_ \"Can you ever love me again, mamma?\" asked Kathleen when Mrs. Desborough left the tent on the lawn for the first time, whilst the ayah took her place by baby...", "...I began to see my lack. The revival meeting had now begun, and I saw that I must either serve God in earnest, obeying him in all things, or quit professing. RECLAIMED One night after services, while on the way to my room, I resolved to get where the Lord would have me to be even if I should have to pray all night. I began; but the more I prayed the worse I felt. I was shown one thing after another that I should have to give up or make right if I would enjoy God's favor. About the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour, I had said the last yes to God, and then came the test of faith. That very evening I had heard the minister instructing seekers to give up all sin, to ask God's forgiveness, and then to believe his promise that he forgives and saves, whether any change was noticed in the feelings or not; and although I had always longed for the great emotions I thought others had experienced, yet in the absence of any particular feeling, I was willing to believe God's promise.

GREAT SNOWSTORM IN NEW YORK.--Every one declares it to be the worst storm they have ever known. Saturday, March 10th, was a balmy, spring day. On Sunday evening some cold rain fell, changing at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> into a freezing sleet. On Monday there was a veritable Dakota blizzard. The air was filled with snow flying before the wind at the rate of sixty miles an hour. It was impossible in the street to keep the eyes open, and almost impossible to walk. Those who did venture out of doors were to be seen clinging to trees for support against the gale, or turning breezy corners upon their hands and knees. Vehicular traffic was totally suspended. Huge snow-ploughs, drawn along the...", "...held a situation of trust in that particular War Office; all these little recollections would begin to take up their places in a connected story: _this_ and _that_, laid together, would become clear as day-light; and to the keen eyes of still surviving enemies--Horne Tooke, 'little Chamier,' Ellis, the Fitzroy, Russell, and Murray houses--the whole progress and catastrophe of the scoundrelism, the perfidy and the profits of the perfidy, would soon become as intelligible as any tale of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> burglary from without, in concert with a wicked butler within, that was ever sifted by judge and jury at the Old Bailey, or critically reviewed by Mr. John Ketch at Tyburn. Francis was the man. Francis was the wicked butler within, whom Pharaoh ought to have hanged, but whom he clothed in royal apparel, and mounted upon a horse that carried him to a curule chair of honor. So far his burglary prospered.

However, upon arrival there we were told that the manager had gone to Bandjermasin the day before, but was expected back at seven o'clock. It did not seem the proper thing to make ourselves at home in his absence, so we returned to the kampong, five minutes below by prahu, to make camp in a spacious, rather clean-looking, shed that formed the pasar or market-place. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I was awakened by the halting of an automobile and a Malay calling out, \"Tuan! Tuan!\" and I stepped from my bed to meet a friendly looking man in a mackintosh, who proved to be Mr. B. Massey, the manager. We talked together for an hour in the calm of a Bornean night. What he said about the irregularity of the climatic conditions interested me. Two years previously it had been so dry for a while that prahus could move only in canals made in the river-bed. His friends had thought...", "...at once to the rising wrath of a whole people and to the shrill blasts of inquisitorial anger, was tossed to and fro, as upon a stormy sea. The commands of the King, too explicit to be tampered with, were obeyed. The theological assembly had met and given advice. The Council of Trent was here and there enforced. The edicts were republished and the inquisitors encouraged. Moreover, in accordance with Philip's suggestion, orders were now given that the heretics should be executed at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in their dungeons, by binding their heads between their knees, and then slowly suffocating them in tubs of water. Secret drowning was substituted for public burning, in order that the heretic's crown of vainglory, which was thought to console him in his agony, might never be placed upon his head. In the course of the summer, Magaret wrote to her brother that the popular frenzy was becoming more and more intense.

Mr. Breeze, late governor of the Union House at Caersws, told me that he had heard of a person going to Aberhafesp Church porch, on All-Hallows' Eve, to ascertain whether there would be a death in that parish in the coming year. A couple of men, one of whom, I believe, Mr. Breeze said was his relative, went to the church porch before twelve o'clock at night, and sat there a length of time without hearing any sound in the church; but about the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour, one of the men distinctly heard the name of his companion uttered by a voice within the church. He was greatly terrified, and, addressing his friend, he found that he had fallen asleep, and that, therefore, fortunately he had not heard the ominous voice. Awaking his companion, he said--\"Let's go away, it's no use waiting here any longer.\" In the course of a few weeks, there was a funeral from the opposite parish of Penstrowed, and the departed was to be buried in...", "...took their blankets one night and camped about thirty yards from the dead horse to await the coming of the bear. The moon was not due to rise until about midnight, and Davis pulled off his boots, rolled up in his blanket and went to sleep.

So he made a small fire and sat beside it, toasting his toes and thinking of things. Just before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> Davis awoke, looked at his watch, and said: \"Well, parson, it is about time for the moon to show up, and the bear is likely to come pretty soon. You'd better put out your fire.\" The preacher shoved some dirt over the embers with his foot, and Davis had just returned his watch to his pocket, when the sound of the crunching of gravel was heard from the bank just above the carcass. Davis looked up and could just make out a huge dark form on the edge of the bank. He raised his...", "...I only stopped to tell you that Butterwick has two setter pups, and that I'd get you one if you wanted it.

The next time the watchman tried to get the colonel out by ringing and kicking the colonel refused to respond, and finally the watchman banged five barrels of his revolver.

The Rue de Maquetra was--is, I may say; I presume it still exists--a long, narrow lane leading to a pretty valley. Something more than half-way up it, on the left-hand side, stands a tall convent wall, the shadow of which, dominated as the heights were by trees on such a motionless <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> as this, plunged the roadway into deepest gloom. The whole length of the lane, to the best of my remembrance, was illuminated by two, at the outside by three, lamps which revealed nothing but their own flames, and so bewildered instead of assisting the eye. Directly opposite the convent wall stood the old chateau, darkened and thickened in front by a profusion of shrubbery, with a short length of wall, as I have already said, at both extremities of it.

The dogs were whirled upon the back-trail, and once more the outfit headed for the school upon the bank of the Yellow Knife. It was well toward <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when Lapierre called a halt. They were close to the edge of the clearing. Leaving one man with the dogs and motioning the others to follow, he stole noiselessly from tree to tree until the dull square of light that glowed from the window of Chloe Elliston's room showed distinctly through the interlacing branches. The quarters of the Indians were shrouded in darkness. For a long time Lapierre stood staring at the little square of light, while his men, motionless as statues,...", "...a censer and some incense.

The American army, under the general command of Major General Shafter, invested the city. The following extract describes picturesquely the fighting three days before the Spanish fleet put to sea.

It was plain, from the stillness that followed, that the man with the powerful hoarse voice had walked to his compass-stand to consider the required bearings. A <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hush came down upon the deep then, spite of the plash and gurgle of waters in motion, and of a dull song of wind up aloft in the rigging of the schooner. Now it was that a single shaft of moonlight glanced through a rift down upon the sea, flashing up the rolling head of a surge into a melting hill of silver.

For more than an hour there seemed to be no change in her patient's condition. Indeed, if anything, the symptoms appeared to be aggravated; she tossed restlessly, the fever apparently increasing, while she called for water every few moments, but refused the gruel, saying she could not swallow it. Eleven o'clock came--half-past; then the long tolling of the tower clock proclaimed <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> ere Katherine was able to detect the slightest sign of improvement. Then, as she responded to another call for water, she found that the fever had abated and there was a slight moisture in the palm of the hand, which she clasped for an instant.

How could it harm Angela to be thought to have run out at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> for a frolic rendezvous?

I was frantic and desperate as I tried to make my way through the thicket, and at last on arriving at the village, I took the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> train and travelled to a town in the State of Maine.

In the summer of 1849 Alfred Romain and Patrick Kelly met at Quailtown, disputed, fought, were parted, and the neat day met by agreement to continue the fight with pistols. They were to meet at sunrise in front of Daniel Mears' store. An attempt was made to pacify them, but in vain. Only Romain appeared at the appointed place, and not finding Kelly, hunted through the village for him. About 9 o'clock A. M. he found him at the house of Kimball, a mulatto man.

They then opened a sudden and simultaneous fire upon all who were within sight. The garrison, thus taken by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> surprise, were in a state of terrible consternation. A hand to hand fight ensued of the utmost ferocity. The Indians, however, soon overpowered their opponents and applied the torch. Captain Davis, who was in command of the fort, with Mr. Lake, who was one of the owners of the island, escaped with two others from the massacre by a back passage, and, rushing to the water's edge, sprang into a canoe and endeavored to reach another island.

The eleven brothers thought that they had come to very hospitable people. They were well attended to, and when they went to bed, each of them got one of the hag's daughters. Esben had been coming along behind them, and had followed the same way, and had also found the same house in the forest. He slipped into this, without either the witch or her daughters noticing him, and hid himself under one of the beds. A little before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he crept quietly out and wakened his brothers. He told these to change night-caps with the witch's daughters. The brothers saw no reason for this, but, to get rid of Esben's persistence, they made the exchange, and slept soundly again. When midnight came Esben heard the old witch come creeping along. She had a broad-bladed axe in her hand, and went over all the eleven beds. It was so dark that she could not see a hand's breadth before her, but she felt her way, and hacked...", "...the distance, which looked to him like a little heap of burning charcoal shining dimly through the damp night air. He was not deceived, and a woman close by it lay with a child who vainly endeavoured to keep up the smouldering fire. The woman was lying on the bare earth, the child knelt close by, and the rider was startled as he caught sight of her face lighted up by the ruddy glow, and her large eyes which reflected the flame she strove to fan with her breath. At this instant the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> toll sounded out from the tower on the mountain, the woman raised her arm and shrieked in a piercing voice, \"Aye! ring away! If there is a God in Heaven that is your knell. On the heath, in the wilderness, in the wood--thus may you all die as I am dying; may your house fall as my hovel fell. May despair rend your hearts, and remorse scorch your brains as they have mine.\" \"Mother, mother, do not curse, it is a sin, you yourself said so,\" implored the little girl, clasping the...", "...idle wings on the still lagoon; To hide from death in the drifting snow, To slay the last of the buffalo. . . .

One spring brought me my wedding day, Brought me my bright-eyed Jeanne Amray; Brought that night to our cabin door My old, lost comrade, Nell Latore.

Nature is apt to be belittled by this sort of display, but the noble dignity of the vast arch of stone was superior to this trifling, and even had a sort of mystery added to its imposing grandeur. It is true that the flaming bonfires and the colored lights and the tiny figures of men and women standing in the gorge within the depth of the arch made the scene theatrical, but it was strange and weird and awful, like the fantasy of a Walpurgis' Night or a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> revel in Faust. The presence of the colored brother in force distinguished this from provincial resorts at the North, even those that employ this color as servants. The flavor of Old Virginia is unmistakable, and life drops into an easy-going pace under this influence. What fine manners, to be sure! The waiters in the diningroom, in white ties and dress-coats, move on springs, starting even to walk with a complicated use of all the muscles of the body, as if in response to...", "...Next day a neighboring farmer ventured to ask Padraig what was going on in the ruined tower. \"Why,\" said Padraig soberly, \"we are raising a brood of hobgoblins for the King. Did ye not know?\" The making of sulphuric acid, nitric acid and their compounds would have been risky business in any age, with the primitive apparatus that the two investigators had. They were furthermore made cautious by the fact that they did not know what might happen if they made the least error. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> after a long and nerve-racking day when they became satisfied that they had the secrets of at least three perilous mixtures in the hollow of their hands. \"I think the King would give seven such chests as the one he sent, if he knew what we know,\" said Brother Basil musingly. \"He has the value of that chest already, in the rose window and the great window, the monstrance, the chalice and the cups,\" Tomaso answered, his sense of money values undimmed. \"They are as good in...", "...that music, though of a simple and even rude character, finds its natural empire over the generous bosom, and produces that strong excitement which cannot be attained by the most learned compositions of the first masters, which are caviare to the common ear, although, doubtless, they afford a delight, exquisite in its kind, to those whose natural capacity and education have enabled them to comprehend and relish those difficult and complicated combinations of harmony.

Hogarth's apprenticeship ended probably in 1718; we find him studying drawing from the life in the Academy in St. Martin's Lane. In 1721 he published _An Emblematical Print on the South Sea (Scheme)_, which was sold at one shilling a copy, and though defective in the sardonic...", "...the tomb yet hung a wreath that Fanny's hand had placed there. But the flowers were hid; it was a wreath of snow! Through the intervals of the huge and still clouds, there gleamed a few melancholy stars. The very calm of the holy spot seemed unutterably sad. The Death of the year overhung the Death of man. And as Philip bent over the tomb, within and without all was ICE and NIGHT! For hours he remained on that spot, alone with his grief and absorbed in his prayer. Long past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> Fanny heard his step on the stairs, and the door of his chamber close with unwonted violence. She heard, too, for some time, his heavy tread on the floor, till suddenly all was silent.

Then there was a sudden plunge from the bushes into the water, a few yards up the bank, and a ripple following some large dark object swimming away towards the other shore. This was more real, and the feeling of awe began to pass away, for I knew that the swimmer must be a water-rat or otter that had been paying a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> visit like myself and was now going homeward by the cool and refreshing marine route. That was the first noise I had heard, but others followed, for an owl began to hoot over yonder in the bushes and a young eagle--I suppose it must have been a young eagle--indulged in a scream from the top of the Cliff, where I believe he has a habit of nesting. Then the supernatural and the imaginative rolled away after they had held me an hour or two, and I was simply alone at two o'clock or...", "...that you leave here which will march onward to your succour, you can deal with yonder army.\" \"A great scheme truly,\" said Hafela in admiration; \"but how do I know whether all this tale is true, or whether you do but set a snare for me?\" \"Bid scouts go out and creep into yonder gully,\" answered Noma, \"and you will see whether or no I have spoken falsely.

His rising was the signal for a hostile ebullition from the Muscovite members who dreaded Zabern's oratory. Not that the marshal was particularly eloquent; far from it.

Suddenly lifting his hands he exclaimed, \"Oh, God, save her, or help me to bear it if she dies.\" It was the first prayer which for long, long years had passed his lips, but it had a power to bring back the olden feeling, when a happy boy, he had knelt at his mother's side, and was not ashamed to pray.

Longstreet, with an army of 20,000 men, one of the fine army corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, was approaching Knoxville from Chattanooga and in the evening we took train and went down the valley as far as Loudon to meet him and dispute his advance. We reached Loudon about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and bivouacked in a large meadow on the south side of the Holston River. Before morning a cold rain-storm came on, making life for a couple of days about as miserable as it could well be. Our tents arrived the 24th, when we crossed to the north side of the river and went into camp. The 28th, the Johnnies made a spirited attack on our boys, driving in the pickets.

It was fortunate for us that the strike was cancelled, for we kept our jobs and in due course got all the things that we were going to strike for. In fact, I got so many concessions by dickering with those bosses that I made life a burden for them at times. I knew the cost of every different kind of plate the mill put out, and so I could demand a high rate of wages and support my demands with logic. My <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> studies had not been in vain. It all came back in cash to the working man; and yet it was my own pals who had rebuked me for being too bookish.

Glad we were when a bend of the river shewed us the island and picturesque fort of Bukkur, apparently blocking up all further progress; the left bank being studded with the white bungalows of Sukkur, half-hidden in clumps of date-trees; while the right was clothed to the water's edge with the bright green foliage of the gardens of Roree.

His wife, like her husband, had been brought up to habits of industry and economy; she proved a kind, constant, and devoted...", "...governor, Gayoso, resorted to various subterfuges and evasion to delay the fixing of the boundary line and the evacuation of Natchez. It was not till March 29th, 1798, that the Spaniards, after exhausting every excuse for delay, and under the influence of a popular uprising supported by the military forces of the United States, finally evacuated Fort Panmure. And then they left, not by the light of day, with military honors and with martial music and banners flying; but like thieves, at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> they stole silently away. It was only after this that Governor Gayoso, from New Orleans, issued commissions to Sir William Dunbar and Capt. Stephen Minor, as commissioners for Spain and in May, 1798, the work of surveying the 31st parallel was begun. The State of Georgia had all along claimed as her own a large portion of the present State of Mississippi, including what is now the county of Adams. This territory she had organized as the county of Bourbon in 1785, and she...", "...of the good Father, and so we leave Fond du Lac.

That is all \"long...", "...story of the fall of man tempted by a snake in the garden of Eden? I usually preached on Sundays, during my four years' course, in the pulpits of the surrounding towns, but it was not of the total depravity nor flaming brimstone; far grander themes engrossed my thoughts and speech; the true heroism of keeping ourselves unspotted from the world, the sublime possibilities of our natures if we would walk in the footsteps of the only perfect One ever seen on earth. By trimming the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> lamp and ruining my eyes, I won a scholarship which paid my tuition fees and room rent, so that I was released from the necessity of drawing on the hard-earned savings of my father.

Only Pete remained to keep the watch, he being comparatively fresh and strong, and declaring that the condition of Mr. Hamlin required his constant attention. It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> that Olly dreamed a troubled dream. She thought that she was riding with Mr. Hamlin to seek her brother, when she suddenly came upon a crowd of excited men who were bearing Gabriel to the gallows. She thought that she turned to Mr. Hamlin frantically for assistance, when she saw to her horror that his face had changed--that it was no longer he who sat beside her, but a strange, wild-looking, haggard man--a man whose face was old and pinched, but whose grey hair was discoloured...", "...us on our journey. We were tired when we returned to the inn, and went to bed directly after tea. My room was at the very top of the house--one flight of steps after another!--but when I drew back the curtains of my window I was repaid for the trouble of panting up-stairs by one of the most splendid moonlight prospects that can be conceived: the whole circuit of the hills, the Castle, the two bridges, the tower on Duniquoich Hill, and the lake with many boats--fit scene for summer <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> festivities! I should have liked to have seen a bevy of Scottish ladies sailing, with music, in a gay barge. William, to whom I have read this, tells me that I have used the very words of Browne of Ottery, Coleridge's fellow-townsman:-- 'As I have seen when on the breast of Thames A heavenly bevy of sweet English dames, In some calm evening of delightful May, With music give a farewell to the day, Or as they would (with an admired tone) Greet night's...", "...made no sign, save that his lips moved as if he were talking to himself. 'Do you know what it means?' I asked, as he left the bed. 'It means that you must get out of this,' he replied gruffly. 'I won't,' I answered, for I had wellnigh lost control over myself. Something, I could not tell what, made me sure that an important change was taking place in my friend's condition, and I forgot all about the etiquette of a sick-room. The experiences through which I had passed, my long, <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> journey, together with the feverish anxiety under which I was suffering, made me forget myself. 'I am his only friend,' I went on, 'and I have a right to be here, and I have a right to know everything. What is it? What have you done?' Scarcely realizing what I was doing, I went to the window and pulled up the blinds. Day was breaking, the sky was clear, and the eastern horizon was tinged with the light of the rising sun. In the light of the new-born day, the lamp...", "...How often at the Miter or Falcon taverns have I seen these little great literary men swell like a toad or puff like a pigeon at the flattery bestowed on them by fawning bohemians, meaner than themselves, who sought a midnight snack and a tankard of foaming ale.

We spread our rubber blankets on the deck to protect us from tobacco juice and other unpleasant things, and spread our woollen blankets on these. Lights were put out at about ten o'clock, and after that there was considerable stumbling around. On the forward deck in front of the steerage department an active poker game, conducted by a professional gambler, was continually in progress, under a sail which had been rigged up as a cover. This game always wore on until <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and attracted many interested spectators as well as players, all crowding around the table on which stacks of gold pieces were piled, under the light of a lantern tied overhead.

One started at the slamming of a door, took every dull thump for a distant explosion; and when we finally turned in I carried the mattress from my room, which faced the south, over to the other side of the building, and laid it on the floor beside another man's bed. Before a shell could reach me it would have to traverse at least three partitions and possibly him as well. After <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the bombardment quieted, but shells continued to visit us from time to time all night. All night the Belgians were retreating across the pontoon bridge, and once--it must have been about two or three o'clock--I heard a sound which meant that all was over.

Will and George were soon asleep, but Tommy and Sandy had no notion of passing their first night in the mine in slumber. Ten minutes after the regular breathing of the two sleepers became audible, Tommy sat up in his bed and deftly threw a pillow so as to strike Sandy in the face. \"Cut it out!\" whispered Sandy. \"You don't have to do anything to wake me up!

McPhail, the operative who had caused Webster's arrest, had never seen that gentleman, and was entirely ignorant of his true character....", "...Wentworth rose mutely, and clasped me to his breast, and silence prevailed between us. It comprehended all. I think, when we meet again in heaven, after that severance which is inevitable to those who wear a mortal shape, we may feel as we did then, but never before!

It was now the seventeenth day since the present tunnel was begun, and he resolved it should be the last. Hour after hour passed, and still the busy chisel was plied, and still the little wooden box with its freight of earth made its monotonous trips from the digger to his comrade and back again. From the early morning of Monday, February 8, 1864, until an hour after midnight the next morning his work went on. As <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> approached, Rose was nearly a physical wreck: the perspiration dripped from every pore of his exhausted body; food he could not have eaten, if he had had it. His labors thus far had given him a somewhat exaggerated estimate of his physical powers. The sensation of fainting was strange to him, but his staggering senses warned him that to faint where he was meant at once his death and burial. He could scarcely inflate his lungs with the poisonous air of the pit; his muscles...", "...day, just before Christmas, he said to his wife: 'Prepare everything for a great feast, to-morrow we will take things with us to the farm that the shepherds there may make merry.' The wife obeyed, and all was prepared as he desired. Next day they both went to the farm, and in the evening the master said to the shepherds: 'Now come, all of you, eat, drink, and make merry. I will watch the flocks myself to-night in your stead.' Then he went out to spend the night with the flocks.

And the dogs answered in their tongue: 'Come in, and for once we shall have enough to eat.'

They could not possibly see us in the darkness of the night, and the moon would rise late. The soft ground prevented the noise of the tramp of the animals being heard, and the only thing we apprehended was that one of our animals might take it into its head to give us a specimen of its charming voice. Fortunately the spirit of singing did not descend on any of them. About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we reached a place where all of us had to dismount, as the animals were wading knee deep in the fine sand. Our station on the morning of the 5th of July was called _Adamkirilgan_, that is, man destroyer, and one glance taken at the surrounding objects was sufficient to prove the propriety of this appellation. As far as the eye could reach, nothing but sand, sand, now like the stormy sea lashing itself into tremendous waves, now again presenting the spectacle of the rippling...", "...I have, whatever you may wish, if you will but take me home.\" Shortly afterwards the king arrived at home, and had so much game with him that his horse could scarcely stand beneath the weight; the other kings were quite impatient with waiting for him, and were highly delighted when he arrived.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> an old woman appeared before the company of jolly kings and shouted as loud as she could in delight because a beautiful little daughter had been born to the king. The devil jumped up and capered about in his joy; _standing on his toes and clapping his bony heels together, he spun the king round like a whirlwind_ and shouted in his ear, \"That girl, king, was not in your house to-day and I will come for her in ten years.\" The devil hereupon saddled midnight and darted off like...", "...spoken jargon which was neither German nor French, but sounded like a clever admixture of both.

To test his condition further he took note of the fine mass of the great dry-goods store on the hither corner, blocking itself out of the blue-black night, and of the Gothic beauty of the church beyond, so near that the coffle of captives might have issued from its sculptured portal, after vain prayer. Fragments of conjecture, of speculation, drifted through his mind. How early did these files begin to form themselves for the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> dole of bread? As early as ten, as nine o'clock? If so, did the fact argue habitual destitution, or merely habitual leisure? Did the slaves in the coffle make acquaintance, or remain strangers to one another, though they were closely neighbored night after night by their misery? Perhaps they joked away the weary hours of waiting; they must have their jokes. Which of them were old-comers, and which novices? Did they ever quarrel over questions of precedence?

The area in front of the Capitoline temple looked across to the Palatine, and the image of Sol and his _quadriga_ must have been in full view; thus the _exordium_ and the next stanza (alme Sol) would be sung looking in that direction.

From the north and the south the enemy dashed forward with fixed bayonets. They melted away before our machine guns and our steady salvos of bombs. The Australians stuck to their posts in the face of overwhelming numbers--four to one: they fought right through the night, and as they fought, strove to build up cover of whatever material came nearest to hand. Thousands of sandbags were used in making good that position. Companies of the 12th Battalion were hurried up towards <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to strengthen the lines, rapidly diminishing under the fury of the Turkish attack. But these men found a communication-way open to them to reach the maze of the enemy's position. Our mines, that had been exploded at the head of the three tunnels mentioned earlier, had formed craters, from which the sappers, under Colonel Elliott and Major Martyn, began to dig their way through to the captured positions. Only two of these tunnels were opened up that night, just six hours...", "...cast off, and our huge wheels began their ceaseless revolutions. It was in some respects a cheerless embarkation. The Indian summer had passed away; the ground was bound by frost; driving showers of sleet were descending; and a cold, howling, wintry wind was sweeping over the waters of Massachusetts Bay. We were considerably retarded between Boston and Halifax by contrary winds. I had retired early to my berth to sleep away the fatigues of several preceding months, and was awoke about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> by the most deafening accumulation of sounds which ever stunned my ears. I felt that I was bruised, and that the berth was unusually hard and cold; and, after groping about in the pitch-darkness, I found that I had been thrown out of it upon the floor, a fact soon made self-evident by my being rolled across the cabin, a peculiarly disagreeable course of locomotion. It was impossible to stand or walk, and in crawling across to my berth I was assailed by my portmanteau, which...", "...the flax grow tall by dancing or leaping high or by jumping backwards from a table; the higher the leap the taller will be the flax that year. There is happily little possible doubt as to the practical reason of this mimic dancing. When Macedonian farmers have done digging their fields they throw their spades up into the air and, catching them again, exclaim, \"May the crop grow as high as the spade has gone.\" In some parts of Eastern Russia the girls dance one by one in a large hoop at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on Shrove Tuesday. The hoop is decked with leaves, flowers and ribbons, and attached to it are a small bell and some flax. While dancing within the hoop each girl has to wave her arms vigorously and cry, \"Flax, grow,\" or words to that effect. When she has done she leaps out of the hoop or is lifted out of it by her partner. Is this art? We shall unhesitatingly answer \"No.\" Is it ritual? With some hesitation we shall probably again answer \"No.\" It is, we think, not a rite,...", "...had an easy temper, foolish and easy-going, that of a perfect gaby; and you would have been deceived, like all at the Cafe David, where no one had ever remarked the studious brow, the sardonic mouth, and the cold eyes of this old man, petted by his vices, and as calm as Vitellius, whose imperial and portly stomach reappeared in him palingenetically, so to speak. In 1816 a young commercial traveler named Gaudissart, who frequented the Cafe David, sat drinking from eleven o'clock till <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> with a half-pay officer. He was so rash as to discuss a conspiracy against the Bourbons, a rather serious plot then on the point of execution. There was no one to be seen in the cafe but Pere Canquoelle, who seemed to be asleep, two waiters who were dozing, and the accountant at the desk. Within four-and-twenty hours Gaudissart was arrested, the plot was discovered. Two men perished on the scaffold.

Alba, Albina, or Bellaria, appear in several Tuscan traditions. They are forms of the Etruscan Alpan, the fairy of the Dawn, a sub-form of Venus, the spirit of Light and Flowers, described in my work on \"Etruscan Roman Traditions.\" It may be remarked as an ingenious touch in the tale, that she always appears at the first dawn, or at three o'clock, and vanishes with broad day. This distinguishes her from the witches and evil spirits, who always come at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and vanish at three o'clock. The readiness with which the young men consented to assume the forms of demons is easily explained. They understood that it meant only a disguise, and it was very common in the Middle Ages for lovers to wear something strange in honour of their mistresses. The dress of a devil would only seem a joke to the habitues of the Cavolaia. It may be also borne in mind that in other tales of Florence it is distinctly stated that spirits confined in...", "...dwelt in heaven but so.\" The Poet answered sadly, \"That is true!\" And then he thought upon unthankfulness; While some went homeward; and the residue, Reflecting that the stars are numberless, Mourned that man's daylight hours should be so few, So short the shining that his path may bless: To nearer themes then tuned their willing lips, And thought no more upon the star's eclipse.

At least, that was the assumption of Tom and Jack, for they could count but nine where there should have been ten. And of the nine one was coming back so slowly as to indicate trouble.

Sail was shortened, and the frigate stood on with topsails, jib, and spanker set, so as to be thoroughly under command. It was no longer necessary to keep the ports closed. The order to open them and to run out the guns was given, and at the same time the crews of the guns were cautioned not to fire a shot till they heard the word of command. The hearts of the coolest beat quicker than usual when about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the _Falcon_ drew within a mile of the enemy. The lights from the fighting lanterns of the latter, which exhibited two rows of ports, with only a small space between them, gave her a most formidable appearance. She evidently carried many more guns than the English frigate. \"What's the odds, lads,\" cried old Jacob, when some of the men near him remarked this. \"It isn't the number of guns a ship carries will give her the victory, it's the way they are fought, and we'll soon...", "...'n' so was Aunt Mandy's gold thimble 'n' all her silver spoons. She'd sorter took to him, too, he was that palaverin' in his way.\" There now ensued a series a questions from Uncle Jud in regard to Old Cy--how long Martin had known him, and all that pertained to his history. It was gladly recited by Martin, together with all the strange happenings in the wilderness, the finding of Chip, the half-breed's pursuit and abduction of her, and much else that has been told. It was almost <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> ere Martin was shown to the best front chamber, and even then he lay awake an hour, listening to the steady prattle of a near-by brook and thinking of all that had happened. * * * * * A tone of regret crept into his voice, however, when, after thanking Uncle Jud and Aunt Mandy, and bidding them good-bye, he addressed Chip. \"I wish I could take you back with me,\" he said, \"your return would be such a blessing to Aunt Comfort and...", "...all they had upon us. A strapping jade, called La Grajales, took a fancy to me, and clothed me from head to foot in her own colours. I liked this sort of living better than any I had yet tried, and therefore resolved to stick to my trusty Grajales till death. I learnt all the cant, and in a short time was an absolute master among the ruffians. The officers of justice took all possible care to search for us, and kept rounds about the sanctuary; yet for all that we took our rambles after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in disguise. Perceiving that this was like to be a tedious business, and that ill fate pursued me everywhere, though it made me never the wiser to take warning for the future, tiring me out like a true obstinate sinner, I therefore, with the advice of my doxy Grajales, resolved to go to the Indies, taking her along with me, to try whether I could meet with better fortune in another country. But it proved worse, for they never mend their condition who only change places...", "...likely only half serious and hardly more than a literary fad--toward the romance of mystery and horror. Horace Walpole, the last man on earth from whom one would expect the romantic and sentimental, produced in his \"Castle of Otranto\" such a book; and Mrs. Radcliffe's \"The Mystery of Udolpho\" (standing for numerous others) manipulated the stage machinery of this pseudo-romantic revival and reaction; moonlit castles, medieval accessories, weird sounds and lights at the dread <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour,--an attack upon the reader's nerves rather than his sensibilities, much the sort of paraphernalia employed with a more spiritual purpose and effect in our own day by the dramatist, Maeterlinck. Beckford's \"Vathek\" and Lewis' \"The Monk\" are variations upon this theme, which for a while was very popular and is decidedly to be seen in the work of the first novelist upon American soil, Charles Brockden Brown, whose somber \"Wieland,\" read with the Radcliffe school in mind,...", "...the dead!

She returned to the feast, and, <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> being well at hand, the Factor sought her out and led her away to the Fort amid joking and outcry, in which the squaws were especially conspicuous. Lit-lit quickly found that married life with the head-man of a fort was even better than she had dreamed. No longer did she have to fetch wood and water and wait hand and foot upon cantankerous menfolk. For the first time in her life she could lie abed till breakfast was on the table. And what a bed!--clean and soft, and...", "...Then he related the history of Dolores, and his own. When it was ended, Vauquelas rubbed his hands joyfully. \"She will not betray us,\" said he. \"Ah well! Everything is for the best.\" He covered the box in which his gold was concealed with earth, and then the two men returned to the drawing-room. They remained in earnest conversation for some time, Vauquelas disclosing his plans for the future, the other listening and proffering occasional but judicious suggestions. It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when they separated. Coursegol walked home. Twice he was stopped by the patrols, but, thanks to the credentials he carried with him, he was allowed to pursue his way unmolested. A week later, Dolores and Coursegol left Bridoul's house to take up their abode in that of Vauquelas. The parting was a sad one. Cornelia Bridoul loved Dolores as fondly as the latter loved her; still they would have frequent opportunities to see each other, and this thought greatly alleviated their...", "...No, she did not know of either of the deaths in the family. Taken all around, I had only substituted one mystery for another. If I knew now why Rosie had taken the basket of dishes, I did not know who had spoken to her and followed her along the drive. If I knew that Louise was in the lodge, I did not know why she was there. If I knew that Arnold Armstrong had spent some time in the lodge the night before he was murdered, I was no nearer the solution of the crime. Who was the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> intruder who had so alarmed Liddy and myself? Who had fallen down the clothes chute? Was Gertrude's lover a villain or a victim?

I gave M. de Beaufort a thrust now and then, which he knew not how to parry with all his cunning, and the Duc d'Orleans, who in his heart was enraged against the Court, continued his correspondence with me very faithfully. Soon after, the Marechal du Plessis came to me at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and embraced me, saying, \"I greet you as our Prime Minister.\" When he saw that I smiled, he added, \"I do not jest; you may be so if you please.

As far as he was concerned, this military expedition of ours was simply a holiday. I should say that about half of us looked upon it in the same way; not consciously, perhaps, but unconsciously. We did not think; we were not capable of it. As for myself, I was full of unreasoning joy to be done with turning out of bed at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and four in the morning, for a while; grateful to have a change, new scenes, new occupations, a new interest. In my thoughts that was as far as I went; I did not go into the details; as a rule one doesn't at twenty-five. Another sample was Smith, the blacksmith's apprentice.

The burden, the hate, the bitterness in his heart, were all gone. A holy love, an exaltation of soul, an awakening of all that is best in a manly life, stirred him. The past was gone; \"old things had passed away and all things had become new.\" The world was the same. Dan, with all his meanness, was in it. The saloon doors were open, the gamblers still sat at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> at the Monte Carlo. Grizzly county had not changed, but he had. A new life was his. As he galloped down the road, far away he heard them singing: \"Palms of victory, crowns of glory, I shall wear,\" and a strange feeling came over him.

The tears stole down his cheeks, tears of joy, as, galloping on through the night toward home, again he...", "...hour after, on came the gale, in a style worthy of its previous hours of preparation; and my friend,--his Saturday's work in his ministerial capacity well over when he had completed his two discourses,--had to begin the Sabbath morning early as the morning itself began, by taking his stand at the helm, in his capacity of skipper of the Betsey.

After supper we lay down upon the divan, with large quilts over us, my friend having promised to rise at twelve o'clock and accompany me to the Greek church. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we were roused by the chant of the Greeks in the streets, on their way to the church. We turned out, and fell into a procession of five hundred people, making the streets as light as day with their torches. At the door of the church we found our host, sitting at a table with a parcel of wax tapers on one side and a box to receive money on the other. We each bought a taper and went in.

This week he kept the long night watch from <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> until eight of the morning; it was now eleven, and he had the cabin to himself. The great gale had blown itself out.

He made his rope at least thirty feet long and then gave it a final test, knot by knot. He judged that it was now near <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and the skies were still very dark.

To no Southern clime I go,-- By a way none living know I shall depart. Many aching hearts may yearn, Many lamps till <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> burn, But I never shall return, When I depart. Trembling, fearing, sorely tried, Waiting for the ebbing tide, Who, oh! who will be my guide When I depart? Once the river cold and black Rolled its waves affrighted back,-- I shall see a shining track When I depart. There my God and Saviour passed, He will be my guide at last,-- Clinging to his merits fast, I shall depart. --_Written in 1858._ TIME FLIES.

My momentary acquaintance was an Irishman. Presently another young fellow, whose appearance was indicative of having recently put off a good many meals, came in and sat down near us. The Irishman looked squarely and inquisitively at the new-comer (who was an Irish-American), and recognizing by some mutual instinct that he belonged to the army who must work and...", "...is, there _is_ a story about this house.

Inglesant took his hand from his weapon, and turning slightly to the page and to the others behind him, he said,-- \"This man, messeri, is a murderer and a villain, steeped in every crime; a cruel secret <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> cut-throat and assassin; a lurker in secret corners to murder the innocent.

Judaea was a Roman province, and as such the Jews could put no man to death without the permission of the Roman governor, who was at that time Pontius Pilate. To obtain Pilate's consent was the next step to be taken; and that the Jews determined to set about as soon as possible in the morning. It was now about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> of the Thursday--the day on which Jesus had eaten the last Supper with His disciples. Some six or seven hours must pass before Jesus could be taken before Pilate, and this time the Jews occupied in ill using and mocking our innocent and holy Lord.

An icy fear gripped his heart at the thought; a nameless dread and horror of the terrible scene he had witnessed at the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> feast of Theodora. For a time he was as one obsessed, hardly master of himself and his actions. In an age where scenes such as those he had witnessed were quickly forgotten the death of Roxana and young Fabio created but little stir.

According to his own observations, Barbicane thought that he should accost her...", "...on Christmas night, if the next day is a week day; and every Sunday night--that is, from twelve midnight, when the Sabbath ends--we have to work to get out Monday morning's paper.\" \"Oh, yes; of course,\" said Fabian. \"Well, I never have had a whole holiday since I have been in the _Watch_ office; but last night, about half-past ten, after the paper had gone to press, the foreman came to me, paid my wages up to the first of January, and told me that I need not return to the office at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> after Sunday, but might have leave of absence until Monday morning, so as to have time to go and spend Christmas with my friends if I wished to do so.\" Just then Clarence Rockharrt joined them and said, anxiously: \"Mother, dear, I think you had better get into the carriage. It is very bleak out here, and you might take cold.\" Mrs. Rockharrt at once took the arm of her youngest and best-beloved son and let him lead her away to the spot where the comfortable family coach...", "...poverty; not the grinding squalid misery he had remarked in every part of John Barton's house, and which contrasted strangely with the pompous sumptuousness of the room in which he now sat. Unaccustomed wonder filled his mind at the reflection of the different lots of the brethren of mankind. Then he roused himself from his reverie, and turned to the object of his search--the Gospel, where he half expected to find the tender pleading: \"They know not what they do.\" It was murk <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> by this time, and the house was still and quiet. There was nothing to interrupt the old man in his unwonted study. Years ago, the Gospel had been his task-book in learning to read. So many years ago, that he had become familiar with the events before he could comprehend the Spirit that made the Life. He fell to the narrative now afresh, with all the interest of a little child. He began at the beginning, and read on almost greedily, understanding for the first time the full...", "...help it. I knew it--I had to tell the truth,\" stammered Job. \"Couldn't help it, you sneak! You owe all you are to me. I guess I am more to you than all your religion!\" \"Uncle, I am sorry to hurt you, but I could do no less and please God. And God is first in my life.\" \"First, is he? Then go to him, and let him feed you and clothe you, you ungrateful wretch!\" And with the words the angry man struck Job such a blow that he went reeling over, a dead-weight, on the floor. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when Tony, passing the door, heard the old man moan. Peering in at the window, he saw him on his knees beside Job, who, with white face and closed eyes, lay on a lounge near the door. Tony stole away to whisper to Hans: \"Guess the old man's made way with the kid! Let's lay low!\" What a night that was for Andrew Malden! Two minutes after he had struck the blow, all the wrath which had gathered strength on that long mountain ride was gone. The blow struck open the door of...", "...upon me. We drifted on, tossed high and low by the tall waves which rose around us like black shadows, threatening destruction at every moment. Often when we had seen one towering above us we had thought that the end had come, and I had felt my lover's arms tighten around me, and my lips had clung close to his. But again and again a reprieve was granted to us. Although every timber in our frail craft shivered, we survived the shock and drifted into smoother water. A little before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the wind dropped, although there was a heavy sea still running. Through a dimly woven mist we could see the stars faintly shining between the masses of black clouds rolling across the wind-swept sky. But there was no moon; nothing to show us whither we were drifting upon the waste of waters. There was something inexpressibly weird in that darkness. It seemed less a blank darkness than a darkness of moving shapes and figures--a living darkness, somehow suggesting death. It will...", "...and bows, you watch.\" Miss Julia Arden went to sleep directly she went to bed, but Catharine, contrary to her usual custom, lay awake till she heard twelve o'clock strike from St. Mary, Abchurch. She started, and thought that she alone, perhaps, of all the people who lay within reach of those chimes had heard them. Why did she not go to sleep? She was unused to wakefulness, and its novelty surprised her with all sorts of vague terrors. She turned from side to side anxiously while <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sounded, but she was young, and in ten minutes afterwards she was dreaming. She was mistaken in supposing that she was the only person awake in Abchurch that night. Mrs. Cardew heard the chimes, and over her their soothing melody had no power.

His head was bowed slightly, as if in thought. \"She was in her room, I suppose. She'd been in bed a long time, for it was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> then.\" The prosecuting attorney pursued this line of questioning to a persistent and trying length. He wanted to know all about the relations of Joe and Ollie; where their respective rooms were, how they passed to and from them, and the entire scheme of the household economy. He asked Joe pointedly, and swung back to that question abruptly and with sharp challenge many times, whether he ever made love to Ollie; whether he ever held her hands, kissed her, talked with her...", "...\"incarnate discipline\"--told how firm a hold Mr. Davis had taken upon the hearts of the army. By the time the review was over twilight had fallen; and a thousand camp-fires sprang up among the tents, with flickering, uncertain light. In it sat groups preparing their suppers and discussing what the visit and review might mean. Some said it was for the secretary to inspect the navy yard; some to examine into the defenses of the fort; and some said that it meant scaling ladders and a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> assault. That night we had a jolly time of it in an Alabama captain's tent--with songs, cards and whisky punch, such as only \"Mac\" could brew. Even \"the colonel\" confessed himself beaten at his great trick; and in compliment drank tumbler after tumbler. As we walked over to our tent in the early mist before dawn, he said: \"Egad! there's mischief brewing--mischief, sir!

And we think of Milton among the triumphant royalists when we read of the Seraph Abdiel \"faithful found among the faithless.\" Nor number nor example with him wrought To swerve from truth or change his constant mind, Though single.

He liked to do his work, assisted by a very few confidential servants. The Prince of Eboli, the famous Ruy Gomez, was dead. So was Cardinal Granvelle. So were Erasso and Delgado. His <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> council--junta de noche--for thus, from its original hour of assembling, and the all of secrecy in which it was enwrapped, it was habitually called--was a triumvirate.

So it went on till past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when sleep had mercy on them. Then next morning they sat at the breakfast-table, silent and ghastly to look at. She remembered her honeymoon journey and very much the same situation. They had nothing to say to each other, and he was as tedious as her husband had been. They kept silence and were ashamed of being in each other's presence. They were conscious of their mutual hatred, and poisoned each other with nerve-poison. At last the deliverer came. The waiter approached...", "...deeds--truly a world of fear and bewilderment. Some days later I had driven up to London in the Rolls with Duperre, leaving Rayne and Lola at home, Duperre's wife being away somewhere on a visit. We took up our quarters at Rayne's chambers, and next day idled about London together. Just before we went out to dinner Martyn called, and after taking a drink Duperre went out with him, remarking to me that he would be in soon after eleven. Hence I went to the theater, and on returning at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> awaited him. I sat reading by the fire and dozed till just past two o'clock, when he returned dressed in unfamiliar clothes: a rough suit of tweeds in which he presented the appearance of a respectable artisan.

It was just about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when he took up his station where he could see all that went on in the camp. He meant to keep a good watch, because, if those rascally tramps were really on the island it was more than possible that they would sooner or later try to make another raid on the larder of the boys in order to satisfy their hunger. The moon had risen long before, but was hidden behind a bank of heavy clouds. Frank was trying to figure out how he ought to act under such conditions. He had said...", "...bolt the door, With Not at Home to any one Excepting Alfred Tennyson.

Either from hunger or from fever in his ankle he slept brokenly.

As god of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sky, Varuna is also \"the covering\" deity, with his universal pall of darkness. Varuna's name has frequently been compared to that of Uranus (------), the Greek god of heaven, who was mutilated by his son Cronos. * Max Mueller, Select Essays, i. 871.

I recall now one of those <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> forays of which, at the risk of my reader's olfactories, I will give a brief glimpse. In company with the superintendent of the mission and a policeman and a lad with a lantern I struck for the \"Cow Bay,\" the classic spot of which Charles Dickens had given such a piquant description in his \"American Notes\" a few years before. Climbing a stairway, from which the banisters had long been broken away for firewood, we entered a dark room. There was only a tallow candle burning in...", "...rose to his feet. \"You stay, if you like,\" said Rudolf, and the count knelt again by his kinsman. Seeing the rough bedsteads by the wall of the attic, I touched Rischenheim on the shoulder and pointed to one of them. Together we lifted Rupert of Hentzau. The revolver was still in his hand, but Bernenstein disengaged it from his grasp. Then Rischenheim and I laid him down, disposing his body decently and spreading over it his riding cloak, still spotted with the mud gathered on his <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> expedition to the hunting-lodge. His face looked much as before the shot was fired; in death, as in life, he was the handsomest fellow in all Ruritania. I wager that many tender hearts ached and many bright eyes were dimmed for him when the news of his guilt and death went forth. There are ladies still in Strelsau who wear his trinkets in an ashamed devotion that cannot forget. Well, even I, who had every good cause to hate and scorn him, set the hair smooth on his brow; while...", "...of Bristol City 546 There were two of us left in the berry-patch 479 These are the things that make me laugh 73 They called him Bill, the hired man 653 They nearly strike me dumb 153 They're always abusing the women 126 They spoke of Progress spiring round 337 They stood on the bridge at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> 489 They tell me (but I really can't 600 They told hum gently he was made 89 They've got a brand-new organ, Sue 162 They went to sea in a sieve, they did 862 Thine eyes, dear ones, dot dot, are like, dash, what? 824 This is the tale that was told to me 680 Thou art like unto a...", "...Henry, round their dwelling Did not load your father's spirit with those deep and burdened sighs;-- Only echoed thoughts of sadness, in your mother's bosom swelling, Fast as tears that dim her eyes.

Saddened for the morrow's parting--up the stairs at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> stealing-- As with cautious foot we glided past the children's open door,-- \"Come in here,\" they said, the lamplight dimpled forms at last revealing, \"Kiss them in their sleep once more.\" You were sleeping, little Henry, with your eyelids scarcely closing, Two sweet faces near together, with their rounded arms entwined:-- And the rose-bud lips were moving, as if stirred in their reposing By the movements of the mind!

And then, suddenly changing her tactics, she sobbed and prayed...", "...landed at Bellevue, Nebraska. This was our first field of labor. We had no church organization here at that time, so everything had to be made from the raw material. Notwithstanding this was the case, we really enjoyed the work. \"We shall never forget the first Nebraska blizzard we encountered. The day before was beautiful almost like a summer day. Mrs. Davis had washed and hung out her clothes. We retired to rest, the soft balmy air, like a zephyr, was blowing from the south. About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the wind shifted to the north and it began to snow. In the morning the weather was freezing cold and the snow was piled in drifts many feet high around the house. We looked out and saw the clothes line but no clothes. We tried to find them, but in vain. They were gone. Not a shred was left save one or two small pieces. And we never saw or heard of them again. Our neighbors who were acquainted with Nebraska blizzards said: 'Your clothes were in Kansas long before morning.' Our...", "...three thousand miles ahead. How had we measured and marked our course? Day by day our captain had taken his instruments, and looking up to the sky had fixed his course by the sun. He was sailing by the heavenly, not the earthly lights. So faith looks up and sails on, by God's great Sun, not seeing one shore line or earthly lighthouse or path upon the way. Often its steps seem to lead into utter uncertainty, and even darkness and disaster. But He opens the way, and often makes such <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hours the very gates of day.

His men were about to shrink away from the field when they saw...", "...gale high into the air in a blinding blizzard. During his retreat he wandered into the wildest part of the mountain before he escaped from the skirts of the storm. Other experiences read like chapters from Peary's or Nansen's records in the Frozen North, and they are just as heroic and thrilling. Yet in face of all these physical difficulties, which only the most superb courage and enthusiasm could overcome, Dr. Church writes that, to the spirit, the mountain reveals itself, at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and at noon, at twilight and at dawn, in storm and in calm, in frost-plume and in verdure, as a wonderland so remote from the ordinary experiences of life that the traveler unconsciously deems that he is entering another world. In the last days of October, 1913, I was privileged to make the trip from Reno in the company of Dr. Church, and two others. We were just ahead of winter's storms, however, though Old Boreas raved somewhat wildly on the summit and covered it with...", "...I felt assured in my own mind, that, instead of giving it to the fishes, they would make a more profitable disposition of it, by selling it to some surgeon for dissection;--body-snatching being a part of their profession, as well as burglary and murder.

It was a large apartment, furnished with exquisite taste and elegance,--in fact, a perfect bower of the graces; and, to my somewhat voluptuous mind, not the least attractive feature of it, was a magnificent and luxurious _bed_, mysteriously hidden beneath a profuse cloud of snowy drapery, heavily laden with costly lace.

Hidden from the eye of men he throws himself upon the ground in an agony of spirit.

He shed no tears, uttered no cry, but groaned in the bitterness of his grief. Then on the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> air the plaintive notes of the wail for the departed fell soft and sad, the coranach of his race, the father wailing for his dead son, calling on his name, repeating it again and again in the curious pathetic monotone peculiar to the Indian.

A fire was built and a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> supper was soon in preparation. They had good appetites, and, tired with the day's journey and events, they got out their blankets and slept soundly. By daylight the lake was seen to be a large sheet of water, rather irregular in outline, with many small bays and coves.

And Catherine, whose mere voice was as balm to this man of many impulses, repeated to him, softly in the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> silence, those noble lines in which Wordsworth has expressed, with the reserve and yet the strength of the great poet, the loftiest yearning of the purest hearts-- 'Enough, if something from our hand have power To live and move, and serve the future hour, And if, as towards the silent tomb we go, Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower, We feel that we are greater than we know.'

Then the Moors, albeit they were loth, obeyed his command; and when they were all gone out of the city, so that none remained, he held himself safer than he had done before. II. Now after the Moors were all gone out of the city, it came to pass in the middle of the night that the Cid was lying in his bed, devising how he might withstand this coming of King Bucar, for Abenalfarax saith that when he was alone in his palace his thoughts were of nothing else. And when it was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> there came a great light into the palace, and a great odour, marvellous sweet. And as he was marvelling what it might be, there appeared before him a man as white as snow; he was in the likeness of an old man, with grey hair and crisp, and he carried certain keys in his hand; and before the Cid could speak to him he said, Sleepest thou, Rodrigo, or what are thou doing? And the Cid made answer, What man art thou who askest me?

We must, therefore, in these and in the like cases, suppose that these remote hints and allusions aimed at some certain follies which were then in vogue, and which at present we have not any notion of.\"[91] His power of ridiculing keenly without malignity is of course best shown in his character of Sir Roger de Coverley, whose delightful simplicity of mind is made the...", "...to its stable, with weary horse and semi-somnolent coachman, crawled through the street.

They all set down at the same door, and took up from it at any hour between <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and dawn, waiting patiently in file in the wide street round the corner, till the summons came as each carriage was required. As seen in the daytime, there was nothing strange about the door, or the house to which it gave access.

Out of the material at hand we must create again our great ones. So, with the growth of Big Business during the last quarter of a century, we have built up the modern myth of the Big Business Man.

But the piano began again -- a short prelude which he knew, and the voice was soon in the midst of the Dream Song from \"La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\" Gethryn rose and walked to his window, threw it open and leaned out. An April night, soft and delicious. The air was heavy with perfume from the pink and white chestnut blossoms. The roof dripped with moisture. Far down in the dark court the gas-jets flickered and flared. From the distance came the softened rumble of a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> cab, which, drawing nearer and nearer and passing the h\u00f4tel with a rollicking rattle of wheels and laughing voices, died away on the smooth pavement by the Luxembourg Gardens. The voice had stopped capriciously in the middle of the song. Gethryn turned back into the room whistling the air.

The passers-by were surprised at the sudden pause in the tune, and still more so at the tears which were running down Christie's cheeks. They little thought that the last time he had played that tune had been in the room of death, and that whilst he was playing it his dearest friend on earth had passed away into the true \"Home, sweet Home.\" But Christie knew, and the notes of the tune brought back the recollection of that <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour. And he could not make up his mind to go on playing till he had looked up into the blue sky and asked for help to rejoice in old Treffy's joy. And then the chorus came very sweetly to him, \"Home, sweet home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home.\" \"And old Treffy's there at last,\" said Christie to himself as he finished playing. One day, about a week after Treffy's funeral, Christie went up the suburban road, in the hopes of seeing poor little Miss...", "...to Lloyd, in which, while seeking to vindicate himself from the charges against his _morale_, he in reality glories in his shame. His sudden celebrity had perhaps acted as a glare of light, revealing faults that might have been overlooked in an obscure person. With his dissipation, too, there mingled some elements of generosity and compassion, as in the story told of him by Charles Johnson in his \"Chrysal\" of the poet succouring a poor starving girl of the town, whom he met in the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> streets,--an incident reminding one of the similar stories told of Dr Johnson, and Burke, and realising the parable of the good Samaritan. Yet his conduct on the whole could not be defended. His next poem was \"The Ghost,\" which he published in parts, and continued at intervals.

The clouds broke away at about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and the thermometer fell considerably, reading about 59 at sunrise. The observing party improved the opportunity for final adjustments of instruments and preparatory observations, and hope revived in the hearts of all.

There were a few sane, clear moments when Sheila realized that the sky was very blue or leaden gray; that the sun shone or did not shine, that the wards were cheery places and that all about her were faces consecrated to unselfish work or to patient suffering.

Any of Percy's acquaintances would have been greatly shocked had they been privileged to witness this triumphal <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> progress across the moors; his dragging legs feebly trying to imitate the motions of walking, but looking much more like kneeling, his head dropped forward on his chest, his shoulders elevated by the grip of his conductors under his pinioned arms, and his eyes bandaged as never a blind-man's-buff could bind them.

Trying the first two doors, he found them shut; the third, however, was not, and he softly pushed it open. And having thus entered the lady's room, he immediately bolted the door behind him.

He was constitutionally brave. He was not passionate in his resentments. To say that he was forgiving by nature would be an immense error; but that he could put aside vengeance at the dictate of policy is very certain. He could temporize, even after the reception of what he esteemed grave injuries, if the offenders were powerful. He never manifested rancor against the Duchess. Even after his...", "...some girdles, garters, necklaces made of goats' haire, and some small coyne of that country, some bowes and arrowes, and clubbs well wrought. The tournes of their heads weare of snakes' skin with bears' pawes. The hayre of some of them very long, & all proper men. We went on the other side of the river the soonest we could, and came to our fort. After we looked about us least we should be surprised, and perceiving nothing, we went about to gett meat for our wants & then to sleepe. Att <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we left that place. Six of us tooke a boate, 5 an other, and 2 the litle one. We row the rest of the night with all strength, & the breaking of the day hid ourselves in very long rushes & our boats. The litle boat went att the other side of the river, those hid it in the wood. One of them went up a tree to spie about, in case he could perceive any thing, to give notice to his comrades, & he was to come within sight of us to warne us. We weare in great danger going downe the...", "...see us.\" Then he said good-bye to her, and she never saw him again, but she knew that he was there, and once she actually heard him; and that was very late on this same evening, long after everyone had gone to bed. For soon after midnight, when Auntie Kate was dreaming about clergymen and bazaars, and when Teddy and George were dreaming about bears, and Jimmy and Jocko about bathrooms, and when Christopher Mark was dreaming about rabbits, and Doris wasn't dreaming at all--soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a little red-hot cinder suddenly popped out of the kitchen grate. It fell on a bit of matting, and burnt its way through to the floor-boards below; and presently a wisp of smoke, with a wicked pungent smell, began to twist upward and flatten against the ceiling. Fuller and fuller grew the kitchen of smoke, and Teddy and George began to dream of camp-fires, but Auntie Kate still dreamt of bazaars and pincushions marked tenpence halfpenny. Teddy and George were sleeping by...", "...every semblance of humanity. The eye is blinded. The swollen tongue can not articulate. What thought of remorse or terror may be rioting through the soul of the dying king, no one knows, and--no one cares. A lamp flickers at the window, which is a signal to those at a safe distance that the king still lives. Its feeble flame is to be extinguished the moment life departs. The courtiers, from the windows of the distant palace, watch with the most intense solicitude the glimmering of that <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> taper. Should the king recover, they dreaded the reproach of having deserted him in the hour of his extremity. They hope, so earnestly, that he may not live. Should he die, they are anxious to be the first in their congratulations to the new king and queen. The hours of the night linger wearily away as expectant courtiers gaze impatiently through the gloom upon that dim torch. The horses are harnessed in the carriages, and waiting at the doors, that the courtiers, without the...", "...their assailants poured in on the larboard, and constant plunges into the water told that they were hastily leaping overboard in their fright. Hardly a blow had been struck. The deck was cleared in almost a minute after the order to board. The only struggle took place below, but this lasted little longer. In less than ten minutes from the time of boarding all resistance was at an end, and the craft was an undisputed prize to the Intrepid's crew. And now to learn the meaning of this <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> assault. The vessel which had been so skilfully captured was the frigate Philadelphia, of the American navy, which had fallen into the hands of the Tripolitans some time before. For years the Moorish powers of Africa had been preying upon the commerce of the Mediterranean, until the weaker nations of Europe were obliged to pay an annual tribute for the security of their commerce. The United States did the same for some time, but the thing grew so annoying that war was at...", "...by one favour to hope for another, till, at length, generosity was exhausted, and officiousness wearied. Another part of his misconduct was the practice of prolonging his visits to unseasonable hours, and disconcerting all the families into which he was admitted. This was an errour in a place of commerce, which all the charms of his conversation could not compensate; for what trader would purchase such airy satisfaction by the loss of solid gain, which must be the consequence of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> merriment, as those hours which were gained at night were generally lost in the morning? Thus Mr. Savage, after the curiosity of the inhabitants was gratified, found the number of his friends daily decreasing, perhaps, without suspecting for what reason their conduct was altered; for he still continued to harass, with his nocturnal intrusions, those that yet countenanced him, and admitted him to their houses. But he did not spend all the time of his residence at Bristol,...", "...eight men. Our instructions were to use all possible diligence to overtake Messrs. Stewart and Keith, and to convey them to the upper end of the last portage; or to return with the goods, if we met too much resistance on the part of the natives. We travelled, then, all that day, and all the night of the 6th, and on the 7th, till evening. Finding ourselves then at a little distance from the rapids, I came to a halt, to put the firearms in order, and let the men take some repose. About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I caused them to re-embark, and ordered the men to sing as they rowed, that the party whom we wished to overtake might hear us as we passed, if perchance they were encamped on some one of the islands of which the river is full in this part. In fact, we had hardly proceeded five or six miles, when we were hailed by some one apparently in the middle of the stream. We stopped rowing, and answered, and were soon joined by our people of the expedition, who were all descending the...", "...game, for it is the only game from which the element of chance is entirely absent. But bridge, perhaps by virtue of its very element of chance, is to-day one of the most popular indoor games. The hostess who invites friends to a bridge-party should provide sufficient card tables for the purpose. If the party consists entirely of ladies, it is usually held in the afternoon and light refreshments are served. If men join the party it is usually held in the evening and terminates in a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> supper. BILLIARDS AND CROQUET There seems to be some very intimate connection between croquet and billiards. But while croquet is a very old game and now rapidly lapsing into disuse, billiards is a comparatively new one enjoying very wide popularity. The fact that small billiard tables are being made to fit conveniently into the drawing-room at home, proves that the modern host and hostess recognize the popularity of the game. Croquet, we find from studying the...", "...Swedes, Irish, English, German, French, Russian, Austrian.] These customs which have become general throughout the United States, varying of course in different localities, are being rapidly introduced into the new possessions where they are engrafted on some of the prettiest customs observed by the people in former years. In Porto Rico on Christmas Day they have a church procession of children in beautiful costumes, which is a very attractive feature. The people feast, dance, attend <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mass on Christmas Eve, then dance and feast until Christmas morning. In fact they dance and feast most of the time from December twenty-fourth until January seventh, when not at church services. On Twelfth Night gifts are exchanged, for as yet Santa Claus has not ventured to visit such a warm climate, so the children continue to receive their gifts from the Holy Kings. However, under the shelter of the American Flag, the Christmas tree is growing in favor. In Hawaii, so far as...", "...to him through their prophets with the voice of Jabez. At least so it happened. Pharaoh might command, but his servants would not obey. Moreover, the story spread, and that night many deserted from the host of Pharaoh and encamped about us, or fled back towards the cities whence they came. Also with them were not a few councillors and priests who had talked secretly with Bakenkhonsu. So it chanced that even if Pharaoh desired to make an end of us, as perhaps he purposed to do in the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> watches, he thought it wisest to let the matter lie until he had finished with the people of Israel. It was a very strange night, silent, with a heavy, stirless air. There were no stars, but the curtain of black cloud which seemed to hang beyond the camp of the Egyptians was alive with lightnings which appeared to shape themselves to letters that I could not read. \"Behold the Book of Fate written in fire by the hand of God!\" said Bakenkhonsu, as he watched. About...", "...of them that may happen to be in the neighbourhood. Keep a sharp look-out, Mr Pierrepoint, and if anything heaves in sight, either ahead or astern, during your watch, give me a call. I'm going below to turn in now.\" I followed suit a minute or two later and, with my cabin-door wide open to freely admit the cool, welcome breeze that poured down through the open skylight, soon fell into a deep, refreshing sleep. CHAPTER SIX. A CAPTURE AND A CHASE. When I went on deck at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I found that there was no occasion to set the studding-sails, for the breeze had freshened to more than half a gale, and the little hooker was staggering along before it and a fast-rising sea at a tremendous pace--considering the drag--with her royal clewed up and furled, and the gaff-topsail hauled down. Even thus she was being greatly over-driven; so, as there was no need for _too much_ hurry, and as the sky astern had a hard, windy look, I took in the topgallant-sail, and...", "...there stood a very wealthy man named Joseph. He was a native of the little town of Arimathea, that lay among the fruitful hills of Ephraim; but was resident in Jerusalem, where he had considerable property. Some of this lay in the close neighborhood of the highway by which the cross of our Lord had been erected. He was also a member of the Jewish Sanhedrim, but it is expressly stated that he had not consented to the counsel or deed of them; if indeed he was summoned to that secret <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> meeting in the palace of Caiaphas, he certainly did not go; he was therefore innocent of any complicity in our Lord's condemnation and death. He was a good man and a just; and like Nathanael, and Simeon, and many more, he waited for the kingdom of God. More than this, he was a disciple of Jesus, though secretly. Whatever our judgment may be about his action during the lifetime of our Lord, we have nothing but admiration for the way in which he acted when He died. What he...", "...by constantly accumulating misfortunes, when suddenly at midnight on a desolate mountain-top, in a storm, I met an old friend and comrade whom I had almost given up as dead. It was a joyful meeting. The natives who had gone to Anadyr Bay in search of Bush and his party had returned in safety, bringing Bush with them, and he was on his way to Gizhiga to carry the news of the famine and get provisions and help. He had been stopped by the storm as we had, and when it abated a little at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we had both started from opposite sides to cross the mountain, and had thus met upon the summit. We went back together to my deserted camp on the south side of the mountain, blew up the embers of my still smouldering fire, spread down our bearskins, and sat there talking until we were as white as polar bears with the drifting snow, and day began to break in the East. Bush brought more bad news. They had gone down to the mouth of the Anadyr, as the priest had already...", "...explanatory, repealing, just in what mode or in what degree we please. Those who think that the judges living and dead are to be condemned, that your tribunals of justice are to be dishonored, that their acts and judgments on this business are to be rescinded,--they will undoubtedly vote against this bill, and for another sort. I am not of the opinion of those gentlemen who are against disturbing the public repose: I like a clamor, whenever there is an abuse. The fire-bell at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> disturbs your sleep, but it keeps you from being burned in your bed. The hue-and-cry alarms the county, but it preserves all the property of the province. All these clamors aim at _redress_. But a clamor made merely for the purpose of rendering the people discontented with their situation, without an endeavor to give them a practical remedy, is indeed one of the worst acts of sedition. I have read and heard much upon the conduct of our courts in the business of libels. I was...", "...side of them appearing to be a continued succession of hill and valley, with only a few of the hills capped with snow, although this was the depth of winter. {457} Smoke was seen at but one place, about two miles inland. In the evening we got a breeze off shore, and stood along the coast, the moon shining brightly and the weather being fine. I kept rather close to the land, during the night, in order to be near the entrance of the supposed St. Sebastian Channel in the morning. \"At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> Cape Santa Inez was distant from us three or four miles, but thence we saw very little of the land, till three, near Cape Penas, after which the weather became thick, and the wind drew round to the N.E., which made me keep more off shore until daylight (9th), when we bore up and stood for the land. Having found Cape Santa Inez and Cape Penas correctly laid down on the chart we used, I thought Cape St. Sebastian would not be far wrong, and we had taken several observations...", "...new moon appeared among the luminous mists of the western sky. To the passengers the prospect of a delightful night was all that could be asked, but the old salts shook their heads. \"You just hold fast all till midnight,\" said one to whom a passenger spoke enthusiastically of the weather. \"To-night is the change of the moon, eh?\" and he nodded his head toward the west. [Illustration: GOVERNMENT STATION AT ST. JOHN. FROM A SKETCH BY COMMANDER CHWAITES, A. N.] Sure enough, by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a northwest gale fit to twist the life out of a ship was roaring over the water, and the little _Ushuaia_ was pitching and tossing along like a Newport catboat in a cross sea. She was then in the Strait of Le Maire, and a worse current for a contrary wind can probably be found nowhere in the world. It is a rush of broken water hurrying along at from five to six and a half knots an hour, while the tide rips, formed by the eddies off the capes on both sides of the strait, are...", "...yet she lived--and all too soon Recovered from that death-like swoon-- But scarce to reason--every sense Had been o'erstrung by pangs intense; And each frail fibre of her brain 360 (As bowstrings, when relaxed by rain, The erring arrow launch aside) Sent forth her thoughts all wild and wide-- The past a blank, the future black, With glimpses of a dreary track, Like lightning on the desert path, When <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> storms are mustering wrath.

CHAPTER THREE Cape Lapa, at the east end of Madura Island, was smoky and indistinct on the port quarter when Captain Barry came out of his stateroom after two brief hours of sleep. He had kept the deck through the night until the brigantine was well away; now, with a natural curiosity, he rose early to take a survey of his new command and her crew. Coming on board at black <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he had sensed rather than seen his first officer. How far that first shadowy impression had satisfied him was evident when he permitted himself to sleep without verifying it by daylight. His crew he had only seen as noiseless shapes between dark bulwarks as they slid rather than ran in response to the officers' orders in getting to sea. The _Barang_ had a deckhouse companion,--that is, a square house built over and around the head of the companionway stairs, forming a...", "...this world. Towards nine in the evening, there had come on a continual short cough, and a rattling in the breast, breath more and more difficult. Why continue? Friedrich is making exit, on the common terms; you may HEAR the curtain rustling down. For most part he was unconscious, never more than half conscious. As the wall-clock above his head struck 11, he asked: \"What o'clock?\" \"Eleven,\" answered they. \"At 4\" murmured he, \"I will rise.\" One of his dogs sat on its Stool near him; about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he noticed it shivering for cold: \"Throw a quilt over it,\" said or beckoned he; that, I think, was his last completely conscious utterance. Afterwards, in a severe choking fit, getting at last rid of the phlegm, he said, \"LA MONTAGNE EST PASSEE, NOUS IRONS MIEUX, We are over the hill, we shall go better now.\" Attendants, Hertzberg, Selle and one or two others, were in the outer room; none in Friedrich's but Strutzki, his Kammerhussar, one of Three who are his sole valets and...", "...turbulent night; the wind freshening from the S.W. as the night came on; and increasing continually in violence till nine next morning. It then blew so hard that we were forced to bring to with the squadron, and to continue under a reefed mizen till eleven at night, having in that time from forty-three to fifty-seven fathoms water on black sand and gravel; and, by an observation we had at noon, we concluded that a current had set us twelve miles to the southward of our reckoning. Toward <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the wind abated, and we again made sail, steering S. In the morning we discovered the southern land beyond the Straits of Magellan, called Terra del Fuego, stretching from S. by W.S.E. 1/2 E.

I can't tear her out of my heart. Diane, my wife, come back! Come back!\" His voice rang through the empty, deserted rooms. He threw himself on the bed, and tore the lace coverings with his finger nails. He wept bitter tears, strong man though he was, while out on the boulevard the laughter of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> revelers mocked at his grief. Finally he rose; he laughed harshly. \"Damn her, she would have dragged me down to her own level,\" he muttered. \"It is for the best. I am a free man once more.\" CHAPTER II. FIVE YEARS AFTERWARDS. Jack Vernon looked discontentedly at the big canvas on the easel, and with a shrug of the shoulders he turned his back on it. He dropped his palette and flung his sheaf of brushes into an open drawer. \"I am not fit for anything...", "...not the retreat from Antwerp resemble the retreat from Mons? It is retreat in any case. Back into Ghent; back, perhaps, to Bruges and to Ostende. No one talks of Ypres. The army does not yet know where Ypres is. However, they filed through Ghent, and it was once more boots, boots, boots, boots over the cobbled roads. It was midnight, and they traversed the whole broad metropolis--singing a song which has not been forgotten in all the intervening years. But now it is <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> again, the night of the 1920 National Fete, and the whole population has got singing drunk and then screaming drunk on beer. Tens of thousands of men and women flock the streets. There are fireworks, there is music, there is dancing. The fronts of the estaminets have been taken out, and seats go from the bar to the middle of the street; long tables on trestles, and plank seats, have been put out; piles of shrimps litter the tables from end to end, and the yellow beer gleams as...", "...an instant I could forget my own path in life, which, opening with every prospect of happiness, yet now offered not a hope for the future. Between these two alternate states the hours crept on. As I sat beside Julia in the carriage, I could not but mark that something weighed also on her spirits. More silent than usual, she replied, when spoken to, with effort; and more than once returned wrong answers to my mother, who talked away unceasingly of the ball and the guests. It was near <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when we drove into the large archway of the Hotel de Rohan, where Madame de Roni held her court. Brilliantly lighted with lamps of various colours, the very equipages were made a part of the spectacle, as they shone in bright and changeful hues, reflected from gorgeous housings, gilded trappings, and costly liveries. A large, dark-coloured travelling-carriage, with a single pair of horses, stood in the corner of the court, the only thing to distinguish it being two mounted...", "...will surely soon overtake us, and our decaying bodies must be hid forever from sight beneath the clods of the valley: but these minds shall then live, and happy they who, by a cultivation of the best principles of our nature, have an antepast of heaven while upon earth.

But the mere thought of it gave him pleasure, and the sight of it, from the very first instant. He was proud of knowing just what it was at once, with the sort of pride which one has in knowing an earthquake, though one has never felt one before. He saw the double file of men stretching up one street, and stretching down the other from the corner of the bakery where the...", "...at the exuberance of their welcome.

There was not a Republican office-holder in the government service. Washington, in the last years of his presidency, and Adams also had given office only to Federalists.

Confused and sleepy as they were, they saw the cause in a moment--the big living tent, in which meals were to be eaten in case of rainy weather, was all ablaze, and the wind that had sprung up during the night was blowing the sparks to the other tents, which caught fire as the girls, frightened and...", "...of three might spend two hours, even three hours, he told them, so long as they performed their task without making a noise that would attract the attention of the sentries on either side. The darkness of the line, from the shadows of the trees and bushes and the deepness of the cutting itself, Max felt he could rely upon to prevent the other sentries from seeing if aught were amiss. The important thing, therefore, was that they should perform their task without noise. Promptly at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the sentries were changed. The momentary bustle was, as arranged carefully beforehand by Max, taken advantage of by the groups of three to creep close up to their objectives. Then things settled down again in quietude.

If the door-lamp went out it was foretold that he would become insensible, and that he was to tell his Rani to sing the praises of the snake...", "...my life of Joseph Sell.

The third day arose--it was dark and dreary out of doors, and I passed it drearily enough within; my brain appeared to have lost much of its former glow, and my pen much of its power; I, however, toiled on, but at midnight had only added seven pages to my history of Joseph Sell.

So night after night \"the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sky was red\" with the glow of blazing canefields and factories, and day after day the tropic sun was half obscured by rolling clouds of smoke from the same conflagrations; while behind them the advancing armies left a broad swath of blackened desolation, above which gaunt, tall chimneys towered solitary, above twisted and ruined machinery, grim monuments of the passing of the destroyer. Day after day the inexorable terror rolled toward the capital. On the last day of the year...", "...of removing something offensive, he washed his hands. He stood for a few moments looking out the window at the quiet city, then he sauntered downstairs and into the deserted parlor, seating himself at the piano. His plump hands wandered over the keys with surprisingly delicate touch. For a short time he improvised. Then as the night quiet stole into his thoughts, he drifted into Rubinstein's Melody in F, playing it dreamily. CHAPTER IV JIM WEEKS CLOSES IN It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when Jim Weeks reached Tillman City. The next morning at breakfast he recognized Mr. McNally, and though he nodded pleasantly, his thoughts were not the most amicable. He knew that McNally meant mischief, and he also knew that McNally's mischief could be accomplished only through one man, Michael Blaney. Heretofore Blaney had not troubled Jim. Jim's power and his hold on Tillman City affairs had combined to inspire the lesser dictator with awe, and in order to obtain...", "...balding gent with large feet. He certainly didn't look like a walking bubonic plague, but then, they never do. Instinctively I closed my thoughts to him. \"What's this snake doing here, Fred?\" I asked my Section Chief quietly. He flushed. He knew my policies. \"What did you expect me to do with him?\" he said hotly. \"This isn't some common snake we picked up out in the country. We snagged this viper right here in Washington, Gyp! I suppose I should have spirited him out of town on the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> jet!\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"That would have been my idea. Do you realize that all this publicity has gotten us a mob of five hundred people around our doors, a mob that's waiting to lynch this prisoner of yours?\" The man gulped and started to say something, but Fred hit him hard between the shoulder blades. \"Shut up,\" he said. \"Nobody cares what you think.\" He walked up close to me. \"Sure I know there's a mob down there,\" he said. \"And I know why they're there. Plain scared to...", "...six miles northeast by north from Tripoli. All the boats were engaged in discharging the transports. The Enterprize arrived from Malta, but brought no intelligence of the long expected frigates. _August 24th._ With a light breeze from the northeast, we stood in with the squadron, prepared for action, intending to attack the town and shipping in the night. At eight in the evening, anchored about two and a half miles from the batteries. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> it fell calm. I sent the bomb vessels, under the protection of the gunboats, to bombard the town; the boats of the squadron were employed in towing them in. At two A.M. the bombardment commenced, and continued until daylight, but with what effect is uncertain. At six all the boats joined us, and were taken in tow by the squadron, which was under weigh and standing off. At seven, anchored four miles north of the town. The weather for several...", "...It was a pitch-black night. The rain was turning to sleet. Divisional Headquarters were in \"Armstrong\" or small canvas huts, draughty and cold. I discussed the coming battle with the staff of the Division and Osborne, the G.S.O. II. of the Corps. We turned in for a snatch of sleep, and I woke with a start--dreaming that my tanks had fallen over a cliff into the sea. At midnight I went to the door of the hut and looked out. A gale was blowing, and sleet was mingled with snow. After <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I waited anxiously for news of my tanks. It was a long trek for one night, and, as we had drawn them so recently, I could not guarantee, from experience, their mechanical condition. There was no margin of time for any except running repairs. At one o'clock still no news had come. The tanks had orders to telephone to me immediately they came to Noreuil, and from Noreuil to the starting-point was at least a ninety-minutes' run. By two o'clock everybody was asking me for...", "...in love, and out again, like Byron, at constant intervals throughout his life, and celebrating the event in verses infinitely sweet and bitter. From Louis Philippe, who had been his school-fellow, he received the post of Librarian to the Minister of the Interior, which, however, he lost at the Revolution of 1848. In 1852 he was elected to the French Academy; but, though only forty-two, his health was already breaking. Like Byron, who loved to write at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> with a glass of gin-and-water at his elbow, Musset used to prime himself with draughts of the still deadlier absinthe. He sank, and died in May, 1857, leaving the greatest name of all French poets except Victor Hugo, and a reputation as a writer of prose stories which may be very fairly estimated by the specimen which follows--the charming little story of \"Camille.\"] I. THE Chevalier des Arcis was a cavalry officer...", "...fatal flame by which it dies. But, Charlotte, now those fleeting joys are fled, And Werter sinks among the silent dead From the bright hopes of life forever gone, His mem'ry lost, and e'en his name unknown, The time shall come, when in the vacant mind, The fondest friend no trace of me shall find; When e'en my kindred my sad fate shall hear, And view my mould'ring grave without a tear, Think on the light impressions of the mind, Which flee as <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> dreams, and leave no trace behind.

And then suddenly she turned hurriedly into a cross street, and headed over toward the East Side. The experience had not been a pleasant one, and it had upset most thoroughly all her calculations; but it was very far, after all, from being disastrous. It meant simply that she must now find Nicky Viner himself and warn the man, and there was ample time in which to do that. The code message specifically stated <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> as the hour at which they proposed to favor old Viner with their unhallowed attentions, and as it was but a little after ten now, she had nearly a full two hours in which to accomplish what should not take her more than a few minutes. Rhoda Gray's lips tightened a little, as she hurried along. Old Nicky Viner still lived in the same disreputable tenement in which he had lived on the night of that murder two years ago, and she could not ward off the thought that it had...", "...of readers than its predecessor, their malice and irritation waxed a degree more intense. They scattered malignant rumours abroad; they showered pamphlets; no imputation was too odious or too ridiculous for them. Diderot, D'Alembert, Voltaire, Rousseau, Buffon, were declared to have organised a league of writers, with the deliberate purpose of attacking the public tranquillity and overthrowing society. They were denounced as heads of a formal conspiracy, a clandestine association, a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> band, united in a horrible community of pestilent opinions and sombre interests. In the seventh volume an article appeared which made the ferment angrier than it had ever been. D'Alembert had lately been the guest of Voltaire at Ferney, whence he had made frequent visits to Geneva. In his intercourse with the ministers of that famous city, he came to the conclusion that their religious opinions were really Socinian, and when he wrote the article on Geneva he stated this. He...", "...of the other room was the price of a book-review, and that sometimes meant a whole day of his precious time. He talked it over with his wife, and she agreed with him. And so they underwent the humiliation of telling their landlady, and they obtained permission to keep Corydon's trunk in the hall, as there was no place for it in the tiny room. Such things as would not go upon the little dressing-stand, or hang behind the door, they put into boxes and shoved under the bed. And now, when <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> came, Thyrsis would go out for a walk while Corydon went to bed; and then he would come in and make his own bed upon the floor, with a quilt which the landlady had given them, and a pair of blankets they had borrowed from home, and his overcoat and some of Corydon's skirts when it was cold. Sometimes it would be very cold, and then he would have to sleep in his clothing; for there was no room save directly under the window, and they would not sleep with the window down. In the...", "...the falls, which could be heard beyond the mountain top. Of course the chief, the girl's father, objected to the attentions of this enemy lover, as also did other and rival admirers of her own tribe. On a mid-summer night the lovers parted, he to go on a mission to Montreal, which then involved a long, difficult and dangerous tramp through the wilderness. Both were pledged to meet again at the falls at midnight of the harvest-moon. As the shadow of the September moon fell upon the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mark on the big rock, the Indian maid arrived in her canoe, but the lover came not. Instead, appeared one of the rival warriors of her own tribe, who told of an ambush, of a poisoned arrow and of a dead lover. [Illustration: Buttermilk Falls] The heart-broken maid then drifted out into midstream and with her canoe passed over the falls and was killed on the rocks below. Tradition goes on to relate how, at midnight of every harvest moon since that tragic event, the ghost...", "...of Flora, the goddess of flowers, at this season. Others, perhaps, have a different, if not an older source. One custom was certainly common to both nations. When the feast of Flora was celebrated, the young Romans went into the woods and brought back green boughs with which they decked the houses. To \"go a-Maying\" is in fact the principal ceremony of the day wherever kept, and for whatever reason. In the north of England children and young folk \"were wont to rise a little after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the morning of May-day, and walk to some neighbouring wood accompanied with music and the blowing of horns, where they broke down branches from the trees, and adorned them with nosegays and crowns of flowers. This done, they returned homewards with their booty about the time of sunrise, and made their doors and windows triumph in the flowery spoil.\" Stubbs, in the _Anatomie of Abuses_ (A.D. 1585), speaks of this custom as common to \"every parish, town, and village.\" The...", "...hovered round the struggling race, a dream by night and day. Mid darkening care and clinging sin they sought their unknown home, Yet ne'er the perfect glory came--Lord, will it ever come?

Aye, though through many a starless night we guard the flaming oil, Though we have watched a weary watch, and toiled a weary toil, Though in the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> wilderness, we wander still forlorn, Yet bear we in our hearts the proof that God shall send the dawn. Deep in the tablets of our hearts he writes that yearning still, The longing that His hand hath wrought shall not his hand fulfil?

But now he saw it all very clearly. He had taken only money, which he would be able to restore; she had given a part of herself, irrevocably. So deeply absorbed was he in his thoughts that the clocks struck many successive quarters without rousing him from his reverie, or suggesting again to him the fixed idea by which his life was governed on that day of the week. But as <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> drew near, the prolonged striking of the bells at every quarter at last attracted his attention. He started suddenly and rose from his seat, trying to count the strokes, but he had not heard the first ones and was astray in his reckoning. It was very late, that was certain, and not many minutes could elapse before the door would open and his friends would enter. He hastily smoothed his hair, looked to the flame of his bright little lamp and made a trip of inspection round the...", "...to his experience, and had neither heard nor seen anything of a spooky nature. The manifestation only lasted for a few weeks. Nothing in the form of a ghost was seen, but much was heard. I will give the story in my brother's own words: \"On a certain evening, a year or two ago, I went out after dinner to visit some friends, and returned home about half-past eleven. \"Not feeling inclined to go to bed, I took up a book and sat down to read for half an hour. \"About a quarter-past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I suddenly became aware that stealthy footsteps were coming upstairs. Looking at my watch I thought it very strange that any of the maids should be still up at such a late hour. \"The door was well ajar, and I arose from my chair, listening intently, as I crossed the room. The footsteps were now quite distinct, and I knew at once they were not those of any woman. They were the stealthy footsteps of a man, and naturally I at once concluded that he was a burglar. \"I...", "...Rome a prodigy, by which was signified that Nature was in travail with a king for the Roman people; and that the senate, in alarm, came to the resolution that no child born that year should be brought up; but that those amongst them, whose wives were pregnant, to secure to themselves a chance of that dignity, took care that the decree of the senate should not be registered in the treasury. I find in the theological books of Asclepiades the Mendesian [248], that Atia, upon attending at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a religious solemnity in honour of Apollo, when the rest of the matrons retired home, fell asleep on her couch in the temple, and that a serpent immediately crept to her, and soon after withdrew.

Near <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the wind fell somewhat, but it still blew so strong that the _Greyhound_ held on its course. Toward morning the tempest died out, and sunrise found them rolling helplessly on the long swells, without enough breeze to steady the boat.

There was nothing to do but sit in my little hole by the elevators, passing the time with a novel and the tray cloth I was embroidering.

Babbitts kept in close touch with him, for he had the promise of being along when they made the inspection of the offices. It took some days to arrange for that and while O'Mally was laying his wires for a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> search, his men were tracking back over Tony Ford's trail. It didn't take them long and there was nothing much brought to light when you considered the kind of a man Tony Ford must be. For the last three years he'd held clerkships in New York and Albany and once, for six months in Detroit.

He called in the three sentries, ordered the constable to maintain silence in the stable, and slipped out to reconnoitre.

By unclosing your eyes so suddenly, you seem to have surprised the personages of your dream in full convocation round your bed, and catch one broad glance at them before they can flit into obscurity.

One noble young man is said to have effected his mother's escape from the jail, and secreted her in the woods until after the delusion had passed away, provided food and clothing for her, erected a wigwam for her shelter, and surrounded her with every comfort her situation would admit of. The poor creature must, however, have endured a great amount of suffering; for one of her larger limbs was...", "...the real range practice was left as a matter of course for over there.

But that was problematical, and, as Joe said, they would have to \"trust to luck.\" And so the preparations for receiving the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> callers went on.

And now, again, the clock of the Old South threw its voice of ages on the breeze, knolling the hourly knell of the past, crying out far and wide through the multitudinous city, and filling our ears, as we sat in the dusky chamber, with its reverberating depth of tone. In that same mansion--in that very chamber--what a volume of history had been told off into hours by the same voice that was now trembling in the air! Many a governor had heard those <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> accents and longed to exchange his stately cares for slumber. And, as for mine host and Mr. Bela Tiffany and the old loyalist and me, we had babbled about dreams of the past until we almost fancied that the clock was still striking in a bygone century.

So we waited and watched; one by one the lambs fell asleep; one by one the stars peeped out; the shepherd nodded and crooned and crooned and nodded, and at last he, too, went fast asleep, and his crook slipped from his keeping. Then we called to the old olive-tree yonder, asking how soon the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour would come; but all the old olive-tree answered was 'Presently, presently,' and finally we, too, fell asleep, wearied by our long watching, and lulled by the rocking and swaying of the old olive-tree in the breezes of the night. \"'But who is this Master?'

The winter of 1863-4 was one full of tense situations and of many alarms for both Confederates and Unionists.

The whole band advanced to a man. Unwilling to sacrifice so many brave men in a death-struggle, he chose three hundred, the sacred number of the Spartan band, his tried and trusty Suliotes. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he placed himself at their head, directing that not a shot should be fired till he sounded his bugle; and his last command was, \"If you lose sight of me, seek me in the pacha's tent.\" In the moment of victory he ordered the pacha to be seized, and received a ball in the loins; his voice still rose above the din of battle, cheering his men until he was struck by another ball in the head, and borne dead from the field of his glory.

Brave to recklessness, he led his men on every daring outbreak, on every perilous <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> adventure. Armed only with his rapier, without defensive armor, he was ever found where the battle raged most fiercely, and numerous were the victims who fell before his sword. On returning, however, from such excursions, he invariably shut himself in his quarters, took to his bed, and lay for days, sick with remorse, and bitterly lamenting all that bloodshed in which he had so deeply participated, and which a cruel fate seemed to render necessary.

Though it was about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when he arrived there, the prince was not asleep. His separation from the fair Princess of China his wife afflicted him as usual. He cursed the minute in which his curiosity tempted him to touch the fatal girdle. Thus did he pass those hours which are devoted to rest, when he heard somebody knock at the garden door. He ran hastily to it, half-dressed as he was; but he had no sooner opened it, than the captain and his seamen took hold of him, and carried him by force on...", "...that the Cavaliere no longer spoke of the Church with that hardness, which had hurt me so often. It is true that the Padre was with us nearly all the time; but not only was Valguanera courteous, he was almost sympathetic; and I wondered if it might not prove that more than one soul benefited by the untoward events of the day. With the aid of the astonished and delighted servants, and no little help as well from Signora Valguanera, I fitted up the long cold Altar in the chapel, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we had the gloomy sanctuary beautiful with flowers and candles. It was a curiously solemn service, in the first hour of the new day, in the midst of blazing candles and the thick incense, the odor of the opening orange-blooms drifting up in the fresh morning air, and mingling with the incense smoke and the perfume of flowers within. Many prayers were said that night for the soul of the dead girl, and I think many afterwards; for after the benediction I remained for a little...", "...rapidly in all directions at their approach; but when Annie one day incautiously suggested that on summer nights the outside world was all at their disposal, they began to discover flaws in their banqueting-hall. Mary Price said the musty smell made her half sick; Phyllis declared that at the sight of a spider she invariably turned faint; and Susan Drummond was heard to murmur that in a dusty, fusty attic even meringues scarcely kept her awake. The girls were all wild to try a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> picnic out of doors, and Annie in her present mood, was only too eager for the fun. With her usual skill she organised the whole undertaking, and eight agitated, slightly frightened, but much excited girls retired to their rooms that night. Annie, in her heart of hearts, felt rather sorry that Mrs Willis should happen to be away; dim ideas of honour and trustworthiness were still stirring in her breast, but she dared not think now. The night was in every respect...", "...farmer should have his home burned from around him or his horded tobacco and corn destroyed? What if some child or its mother should wail out their sorrowful notes of discomfort and grief before another day's sun shall have risen?

Those things were nothing to them; they sang on gleefully. But the harmony of their song soon died away, for there came through the stillness of the moment the soft sweet tones of Nora Judson's voice as she wended slowly down the road in search of old Brindle.

So the two girls struggled bravely on through the thick woods, though it was difficult to walk abreast in the narrow path. Barbara insisted she was better with each step, but Mollie knew otherwise. With every foot of ground they covered Bab limped more and more painfully. Now and then when her injured foot pressed too heavily on the rough ground, she caught her breath and swallowed a groan. Mollie realized they would not get home before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> at the rate they were now moving. \"Rest here, Bab,\" she insisted, when they came to an opening in the woods where the shade was less dense. \"I think I see a place over there that must lead into a road. I will run on ahead and find some one to come back to help you.\" Bab was glad to sit down. Her foot was swelling and growing more painful every moment; her pulses were throbbing. She was almost crying, but she would never mention surrender; she was not sorry, however, when...", "...looked down as into a dark trench, where, in the midst of so much life, and hope, and renewal of existence, stood the terrible instrument of death. It seemed as if the very sun forbore to look upon it. But it was better, grim and sombre in the shade, than when, the day being more advanced, it stood confessed in the full glare and glory of the sun, with its black paint blistering, and its nooses dangling in the light like loathsome garlands. It was better in the solitude and gloom of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> with a few forms clustering about it, than in the freshness and the stir of morning: the centre of an eager crowd. It was better haunting the street like a spectre, when men were in their beds, and influencing perchance the city's dreams, than braving the broad day, and thrusting its obscene presence upon their waking senses.

The boy was restless. Genius was beginning to burn. Sometimes he walked the floor for hours while the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> oil burned on his study table. At times he loved to walk on the banks of the river, setting his beautiful thoughts to the music of its melodious rhythm. On that dark, cold night Chester had wandered from the cottage porch down to the river's edge, and so he caught with startled ears the sound of that sullen splash into the waves--caught the sound, and scarce a minute later saw, with keen eyes strained into the gloom, a body floating in the river past the cottage. \"A...", "...\"I reckon you've struck it, stranger.

There he fell asleep, but towards <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he was awakened by the tramp of animals and the creaking of wheels. Looking down, he saw several ox teams approaching, each dragging a wagon filled with building materials and led by a weird spectre form.

He had become enamoured of political matters, and discussed them very vigorously with his customers and others who made his work-room a meeting-place where they might hear and debate the latest news. Sometimes these discussions drew him from home into the house of a neighbor, and so absorbed his time that he found himself at the end of the day far behind in his work, and obliged to sit up till <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in order to finish it. One night, however, he received a severe rebuke from some anonymous counsellor, which effectually put a stop to this bad habit.

At sunrise they were roused by the report of heavy guns, and perceived an English frigate about eight miles further up the straits, and more in the mid-channel, engaging nine or ten Spanish gun-boats, which had come out from Algesiras to attack her. It still continued a dead calm, and the boats of the frigate were all ahead towing her, so as to bring her broadside to bear upon the Spanish flotilla.

When Sir Joshua Reynolds and Johnson were dining at Mrs. Garrick's house in London they were regaled with Uttoxeter ale, which had a \"peculiar appropriate value,\" but Johnson's beverage at the London taverns was lemonade, or the juice of oranges, or tea, and it was his boast that \"with tea he amused the evenings, with tea solaced the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour, and with tea welcomed the morning.\" He was credited with drinking enormous quantities of that beverage, the highest number of cups recorded being twenty-five at one time, but the size of the cups were very much smaller in those days.

By the clock across the Plaza they saw it was two hours after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> as they stepped into the street; then, finding no coaches in sight, they set out to walk toward Ancon, both badly in need of the open air. A moment later Clifford followed them, taking pains to keep at a distance. Now that the full import of Cortlandt's accusation had sunk into his mind, Kirk lapsed into a mood of sullen bitterness.

He was just going to bed, he said, in a drowsy and somewhat injured tone. \"I told Sir Thomas and my lady you was in and gone to bed, m'm,\" he said, almost reproachfully. \"They come in half an hour back!

Emma cried, and he tried to console her, adorning his protestations with puns. \"Oh,\" she went on, \"I love...", "...more successful than such efforts usually are. But Madame Francesca, putting aside the burden of her seventy years, laughed and talked and told stories with all the zest of a girl. Inspired by her shining example, the Colonel dragged forth a few musty old anecdotes and offered them for inspection. They were new to the younger generation, and Madame affected to find them new also. Rose wondered at her, as often, envying her the gift of detachment. The fear that had come upon Rose at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> was with her still, haunting her, waking or sleeping, like some evil thing. Proudly she said to herself that she would seek no man, though her heart should break for love of him; that though her soul writhed in anguish, neither he nor the woman who took him from her should ever even suspect she cared. She forced herself to meet Allison's eyes with a smile, to answer his questions, and to put in a word, now and then, when Madame or the Colonel paused.

Mr. Froude, with his great skill in depicting individual character and particular events, follows the novel-writer's method, and may be said to be the originator of what we may designate as the \"psychological school\" of history. This power gives him an immense advantage over all other historians. While they are burning the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> lamp in the endeavor to detect the springs of action by the study of every thing that can throw light upon the action itself, he has only to look through the window which, like unto other novelists, he has constructed in the bosom of every one of his characters, to show us their most secret thoughts and aspirations. One may open any of Mr. Froude's volumes at random and find an exemplification of what is here stated. Here is one: \"It was not thus that Mary Stuart had...", "...promontory gazed The stranger, raptured and amazed, And, 'What a scene were here,' he cried, 'For princely pomp or churchman's pride!

As the night was not cold she went and threw the window open, feeling that the companionship of the stars would destroy all these fantastic fancies; and very soon her sense of loneliness and oppression passed away, for there came a soft wind that lifted the curls of her long fair hair, and kissed her cheek caressingly, and she could not help believing it was a breeze from the Irish hills that bore to her the...", "...was no part of Tode's plan to be discovered by that gentleman just at present.

But not a man fell out, and after resting until two o'clock next morning they were on foot again, springing up with cheerful alacrity at the sound of the bugle. A dust-storm swept upon them as they started; they plodded steadily through it, marched for thirty-two miles with only the briefest halts, rested during the day at Boran, and were off again soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the next stage of thirty-two miles to Jani-ki-sang. Another night march brought them to Rawal Pindi. There they heard how the mutiny was spreading--a terrible tale of rapine, incendiarism and massacre; and--a little light amid the darkness--how native princes in various parts were showing a noble loyalty, and placing their swords at the service of the British.

In the first three weeks my shore gang, which included the lusty Canadian physicist, Wright, carried many hundreds of cases, walked miles daily, dug ice, picked, shovelled, handed ponies, cooked and danced.

I've had a telegram calling me back to Fort Benton, and must leave on the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> train.\" Danvers walked to the little depot, a mile from the city proper, with his friend, and after the train pulled out he again thought of Winifred. As he passed, on his way back to town, the huge piles of loose rock that the miners had left in their sluicing for gold in bygone days, his thoughts followed the girl back into the long years since he had first met her on the _Far West_--a child eager for sympathy. It was odd that he had never seen her in all that time--the...", "...time, then crept to the pool-side, and repeated the song which she had sung, and immediately there was a great rush of fish towards him, at the number and size of which he was amazed. By this he perceived what chance of booty there was here for him, and he sped away to the path to the place where he had left his men, and he cried out to them, \"Come, haste with me to the woods by a great pool, where I have discovered loads of fish.\" His men were only too glad to obey him, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> they had all arrived at the pool. After stationing them near him in a line, with their spears poised to strike, Koku sang the song of Izoka in a soft voice, and the great and small fish leapt joyfully from the depths where they were sleeping, and they thronged towards the shore, flinging themselves over each other, and they stood for awhile gazing doubtfully up at the line of men. But soon the cruel spears flew from their hands, and Munu, the pride of Izoka, was pierced by...", "...good,\" said Miss Casey, simply, and with a sigh of satisfaction. Hefty was undoubtedly a great success. The men came around him and pawed him, and felt the dents in the armor, and tried the weight of it by holding up one of his arms, and handled him generally as though he were a freak in a museum. \"Let 'em alone,\" said Hefty to Miss Casey, \"I'm not sayin' a word.

From a small leather bag, hidden in the breast of her dress she took several priceless gems and tossed them through to the king, retaining several less valuable ones; then saying she would return between <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and morning she went to a hovel built against the outer wall, in the beggar colony and prepared food for her boy.

The river, and therefore the bayou, were now low, exposing wide margins of batture, and Green's plan was, while surrounding and threatening the fort on its land faces, to gain an entrance on the water front by crossing the batture and passing around the ends of the stockades. At ten minutes past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the red light of a Coston signal from the fort announced to the Navy that the enemy were coming. At twenty minutes past one the fight was opened by the Confederates with musketry. Instantly the fort replied with the fire of its guns, and of every musket that could be brought to the parapet. Five minutes later the _Princess Royal_, which, since nightfall, had been under way and cleared for action, began shelling the woods on the right of the fort, firing a few 9-inch and...", "...works so much,\" said Polly, ready to be amused by anything that made her forget herself. \"Ah, my dear, it 's a very common story, and that 's the saddest part of it.

Lyttelton's Brigade returned under cover of darkness to a bivouac underneath the Zwartkop guns. Their losses in the two days' operations had been 225 officers and men. General Hildyard, with whom was Prince Christian Victor, spent the night in improving the defences of the hill and in building new traverses and head cover. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the Boers made a fresh effort to regain the position, and the sudden roar of musketry awakened the sleeping army. The attack, however, was easily repulsed. At daybreak the shelling began again, only now the Boers had brought up several new guns, and the bombardment was much heavier. Owing, however, to the excellent cover which had been arranged the casualties during the day did not exceed forty.

Viewing sleep as a time when broken-down bodily cells are restored, we see that we tax the energies of the body less if we go to sleep each day before the cells are entirely depleted. That is the significance of the old teaching that sleep before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> is more efficacious than sleep after midnight. It is not that there is any mystic virtue in the hours before twelve, but that in the early part of the evening the cells are not so nearly exhausted as they are later in the evening, and it is much easier to repair them in the partially exhausted stage than it is in the completely exhausted stage. For this reason, a mid-day nap is often effective, or a short nap after the evening dinner. By thus catching the cells at an early...", "...way but this? How far was HE--moving among them unscathed and uninjured--responsible? And if not he--who then? His mind went back bitterly to the old days of the conspiracy--to the inception of that struggle which was bearing such ghastly fruit.

Its spotless, peaceful walls and draperies affected him strangely, as if he had brought into its immaculate serenity the sanguine stain of war. He was awakened suddenly from a deep slumber by an indefinite sense of alarm. His first thought was that he had been summoned to repel an attack. He sat up and listened; everything was silent except the measured...", "...\"You'll be on sick leave till to-morrow morning, when Josh Fernald is expecting you at headquarters, and then it'll be for him to say when we're to see you again.\" \"But of course I'll sleep at Mrs. Hanson's same's I've been doin'?\" \"I can't say how it'll be, lad; but whatever Josh allows must be done will come nigh being right.\" What between his happiness and the sleep he had indulged in during the early part of the evening, Seth Bartlett was unusually wakeful, and until past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he lay in a cot near 'Lish Davis's bed speculating upon what Mr. Fernald might be able to do in regard to procuring his admission to the school at headquarters. Then slumber interfered with his waking dreams, and he knew no more until daylight next morning, when he crept softly out of bed to perform his customary task.

The whole city too is poured forth for festival. The people lounge on the quays and cluster on the bridges; the light barks skim along in crowds, just touching the surface of the water, while their bright prows of polished iron gleam in the moonshine, and glitter in the rippling wave. Not a sound that is not graceful: the tinkle of guitars, the sighs of serenaders, and the responsive chorus of gondoliers.

There was no mirth in his smile though there was lightness in his tone as said: \"Then let us go back to the matter in hand. You need a helper; where are you going to find one if you don't take me?\" A growl from Brotherson's set lips.

Then it was--with the very act of its announcing itself--that her identity flared up in a change of posture. She rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; but even as I fixed and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed away. Dark as <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in her black dress, her haggard beauty and her unutterable woe, she had looked at me long enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as mine to sit at hers.

We had then the mortification to find one of the skins was defective, and let out the water at an hundred different pores. I directed the water that remained in the skin to be given to the stock rather than that it should be lost; but both horses and bullocks refused it. During the first part of the night it was very oppressive; but about an hour after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the wind shifted to the south, and it became cooler. We resumed our journey at 7, and did not again halt until half past 12 p.m. of the 8th, having then gained the Muddy Lagoon, at which the reader will recollect we stopped for a short time after breaking through the Pine forest about the same period the year before; but as there was nothing for the animals to eat, I took them across the creek and put them upon an acre or two of green feed along its banks. I observed that the...", "...far the sound came we could not determine.. \"Keep her as she is, bos'n's mate,\" commanded the master. \"Faith, as if I did not know; this is none other than the Race of Portland!\" As night came on, the wind, hitherto steady, increased into a gale, and before midnight it blew a hurricane such as had not been known for years; and to sheer off a dangerous coast we had to keep under storm canvas, though had we had searoom the master would have had the ship to lay to. An hour after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> our mainsail, though treble-reefed, parted with a report that was heard above the storm, the torn canvas streaming out to lee'ard like so many whips; and simultaneously our bowsprit carried away close to the gammonings, with the result that the ship yawed, then shot up into the wind. With a shuddering crash the foremast went by the board, and we were helpless in the midst of the raging sea. I kept close to Captain Poynings, who gave no sign of the presentiment that the...", "...end, but there was no respite for the weary soldier. There was to be no rest or period for recuperation. The Regiment was ordered to Ypres immediately. Tired and exhausted, the men were taken out of the Somme inferno, having lost many of their comrades, and with weary bodies and heavy hearts they faced the prospect of the untold terrors of the fatal city of Ypres. The journey to Ypres was long. First the Battalion entrained at Mericourt in the afternoon of Sunday the 1st October. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the men detrained at Longpre and marched to Cocquerel, arriving at 3 a.m. the next day. The men then bivouacked until reveille at 6-30 a.m. At 8-30 a.m. the Regiment was again on the march to Pont Remy, where it entrained for Esquelbecq, where it arrived at 9-30 p.m., and marched to billets at Wormhoudt. Two days were spent here, and this afforded the men the rest they so badly needed. The state of the Battalion can be gauged from the fact that at Wormhoudt only one company...", "...I walked about the streets till nearly morning. Whole squares and streets were crumbling to ashes and tall buildings tumbled down everywhere. Here and there, too, there was a terrific explosion. It was Moscow done over on a smaller scale. A division of Union troops, under Hazen, was sent into the town to fight the flames and to arrest every man discovered firing houses or walking around without a pass. So it happened that my comrade and myself, though but innocent spectators, were at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> arrested and taken to provost headquarters. We very soon explained ourselves and were released and sent to comfortable quarters, where we slept till late the next day. It was four nights since we had had any sleep at all.

Half of them were dead, the army itself was flying everywhere, and in the blackness of this terrible night their...", "...organs and is eliminated. In this state of negative repose there is no manifestation of thought, and it is as unlike the clairvoyant or sensitive state as that of wakefulness; but shaded into this state of sleep, as into that of wakefulness, are various degrees of sensitiveness. The conditions of sleep are provocative of this impressibleness. Night is negative; the silence and the vail of darkness shutting out external objects conduce to make the mind negative and susceptible. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> is the culmination of this negativeness, and hence the ghastly dread of that hour has a foundation in fact, and is not an idle superstition.

The valleys were free from trees, though here and there occurred dense thickets of underwood, in which Maxton told them that grizzly-bears loved to dwell--a piece of information that induced most of the party to carry their rifles in a handy position, and glance suspiciously at every shadow. Large oaks and bay-trees covered the lower slopes of the hills, while higher up the white oak and fir predominated. About an hour after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the moon began to descend towards the horizon, and Ned Sinton, who had been unanimously elected commander of the little band, called a halt in the neighbourhood of a rivulet, which flowed round the base of an abrupt cliff whose sides were partially clothed with scrubby bushes. \"We shall encamp here for the night, comrades,\" said he, dismounting; \"here is water and food for our nags, a fine piece of greensward to spread our blankets on, and a thick-leaved oak to keep the dew...", "...right, and returned to his own corps at Chattanooga. As night closed in, I ordered General Jeff. C. Davis to keep one of his brigades at the bridge, one close up to my position, and one intermediate. Thus we passed the night, heavy details being kept busy at work on the intrenchments on the hill. During the night the sky cleared away bright, a cold frost filled the air, and our camp-fires revealed to the enemy and to our friends in Chattanooga our position on Missionary Ridge. About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I received, at the hands of Major Rowley (of General Grant's staff), orders to attack the enemy at \"dawn of day,\" with notice that General Thomas would attack in force early in the day.

What must have been the character of the homes that received such men after their <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> revels? Many a happy household has been turned into grief through their demoralizing influence; mothers, wives, and daughters have often, in the lonely hours of midnight, sat up with a scanty light and a dying fire awaiting the late return of a son, a husband, or a brother; with many a sigh they would trace the ruin of their domestic felicity and the wreck of their family to some lodge of the secret societies.

But Fred had not been four years in a cavalry regiment without knowing how to protect himself in such a difficulty as this. \"The canoe will only hold myself and the man,\" said Fred, with perfect simplicity. Mr. Finucane drew himself up haughtily and did not utter another word for the next five minutes. Nevertheless he took a most affectionate leave of the young officer when half an hour after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he was told by Father Marty that it was time for him to go home. Father Creech also took his leave, and then Fred and the priest of Liscannor were left sitting together over the embers of the turf fire. \"You'll be going up to see our friends at Ardkill to-morrow,\" said the priest. \"Likely enough, Father Marty.\" \"In course you will.

It was he who wisely advised the burgesses of Ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats, and who first told the young priest Atal where it is that black cats go at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on St. John's Eve. Barzai was learned in the lore of earth's gods, and had gained a desire to look upon their faces.

Many would not venture to bed till their hopes were made certain by the striking of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour; and then they were so overjoyed at what appeared a new lease of life, that sleep, that \"sweet restorer,\" was a stranger during the night. In the morning, however, a gloom was again cast over the spirits of some of the most superstitious by the remark of a meddlesome old West India captain, that undoubtedly Cochran, like the seers of olden times, made his calculations according to the \"old style\" of computing time.

The moon had a double ring, and it awoke a verse from the girl who stood wrapped in her furs: \"That orbed maiden, with white fire laden, Whom mortals call the moon, Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-lined floor, By <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> breezes strewn.\" Stirling turned his head slightly and smiled with the snow dripping from his lips. The girl glanced ahead and shuddered as a drifting cloud obscured the moon. The way was mantled with falling ice particles, and the ship's rigging showed up ghostlike. The muffled Russians on the forepeak moved about in the gloom like walruses that had climbed aboard. The _Pole Star_ hurtled on. Stirling sensed the true direction with the skill of a master pilot and dodged...", "...eagle alit one moment may sit In the light of its golden wings. And, when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath, Its ardor of rest and of love, And the crimson pall of eve may fall From the depth of heaven above, With wings folded I rest on mine airy nest, As still as a brooding dove. IV. That orbed maiden, with white-fire laden, Whom mortals call the Moon, Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor By the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> breezes strewn; And wherever the beat of her unseen feet, Which only the angels hear, May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof, The Stars peep behind her and peer. And I laugh to see them whirl and flee Like a swarm of golden bees, When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,-- Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas, Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high, Are each pav'd with the moon and these....", "...exceedingly slippery and greasy, they seemed to be an austere and dismal set of fanatics: true disciples of the great Macarius, the founder of these secluded monasteries, and excellently calculated to figure in that grim chorus of his invention, or at least which is called after his name, \"La danse Macabre,\" known to us by the appellation of the Dance of Death. They seemed to be men who fasted much and feasted little; great observers were they of vigils, of penance, of pilgrimages, and <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> masses; eaters of bitter herbs for conscience' sake. It was such men as these who lived on the tops of columns, and took up their abodes in tombs, and thought it was a sign of holiness to look like a wild beast--that it was wicked to be clean, and superfluous to be useful in this world; and who did evil to themselves that good might come. Poor fellows! they meant well, and knew no better; and what more can be said for the endeavours of the best of men?

But the fairies no longer dance their moonlight rigadoon upon the charmed circle of the champignon, nor do the nimble elves \"rear their <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mushrooms\" upon the rings of lush grass as of old, for science has stepped in and cleared up the mystery. The Rev. M. J. Berkeley, in his _Outlines to British Fungology_, thus completely rescues the \"fairy-ring\" from the domain of poetry and reduces it to prosaic fact: [Illustration: _Marasmius oreades_] _PLATE VIII_ FAIRY RING CHAMPIGNON =Marasmius oreades= =Pileus:= Convex at first, becoming flat, with a mound at centre, at juncture of...", "...I read that sweet story of old, I.237 If Fortune, with a smiling face, I.463 I'm a pretty little thing, I.353 I'm a very little child, I.354 Immortal love, forever full, IV.54 In heavenly love abiding, I.314 *Innocent Play, I.343 In the cross of Christ I glory, I.261 It came upon the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> clear, IV.25 It chanced upon the merry, merry Christmas eve, I.402 Jesus calls us: o'er the tumult, IV.l01 Jesus, I my cross have taken, IV.57 Jesus, lover of my soul, V.483 Jesus, Saviour, pilot me, IV.100 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun, IV.317 Joy to the world, the Lord is come, IV.30...", "...He took a seat in the night express which rolled out from the station a few moments later. As he was alone in his compartment, Muller gave way to his excitement, sometimes even murmuring half-aloud the thoughts that rushed through his brain. \"Yes, I am convinced of it, but can I find the proofs?\" the words came again and again, and in spite of the comfortable warmth in the compartment, in spite of his tired and half-frozen condition, he could not sleep. He reached the capital at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and took a room in a small hotel in a quiet street. When he went out next morning, the servants looked after him with suspicion, as in their opinion a man who spent most of the night pacing up and down his room must surely have a guilty conscience. Muller went to police headquarters and looked through the arrivals at the hotels on the 21st of November. The burial of Mrs. Kniepp had taken place on the 20th. Muller soon found the name he was looking for, \"Forest Councillor Leo...", "...as he sang his lofty strain, And pours his life through each resounding line, As ocean, when the stormy winds are hushed, Still rolls and thunders through his billowy caves.

On the morrow a slave brought him some food, and curious people came with the King's servants to see him; but the day passed without Jussuf being able to observe his countryman among the remaining slaves in the court below. Full of hope, he watched the approach of night, when he hoped to receive counsel and help. The slave came at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and called him by his name. \"Now,\" said Jussuf, \"what news do you bring?\" \"Alas! my lord,\" answered the slave, \"I know not what to think. Although the Princess is a faithful follower of the Prophet, she was very quiet when I related your history: I expected she would have concerned herself about your being offered to a snake; but she heard me tranquilly.\" Jussuf asked if she had not sent him any counsel. \"No; she said no other word,\" answered the slave, \"than, 'Tell...", "...I feel about all this as two Christian gentlemen should.\" A last pleasure was secured for him. He had been waiting with painful interest for news of Gordon and Khartoum; and by great good fortune a false report reached him that the city was relieved, and the men of Sussex (his old neighbours) had been the first to enter. He sat up in bed and gave three cheers for the Sussex Regiment. The subsequent correction, if it came in time, was prudently withheld from the dying man. An hour before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the 5th of February, he passed away: aged eighty-four. Word of his death was kept from Mrs. Jenkin; and she survived him no more than nine-and-forty hours. On the day before her death she received a letter from her old friend Miss Bell of Manchester, knew the hand, kissed the envelope and laid it on her heart; so that she too died upon a pleasure. Half an hour after midnight, on the 8th of February, she fell asleep: it is supposed in her seventy-eighth year. Thus, in...", "...waited an hour, and then returned on board. Mrs. Lascelles was triumphant; and she rewarded her new ally--the smuggler--with one of her sweetest smiles. Community of interest will sometimes make strange friendships. CHAPTER VII CONCLUSION We must now return to the other parties who have assisted in the acts of this little drama. Lord B., after paddling and paddling, the men relieving each other, in order to make head against the wind, which was off shore, arrived about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> at a small town in West Bay, from whence he took a chaise on to Portsmouth, taking it for granted that his yacht would arrive as soon as, if not before himself, little imagining that it was in possession of the smugglers. There he remained three or four days, when, becoming impatient, he applied to one of his friends who had a yacht at Cowes, and sailed with him to look after his own. We left the _Happy-go-lucky_ chased by the revenue cutter. At first the smuggler had the...", "...melancholy. After awhile Adelaide also became silent, since she very rarely got any reply to her remarks. So they ate their dinner in silence and separated as soon as possible afterwards. Frank, however, had work to do at least, he could not _always_ think and brood and look at the locked door which led into Gertrude's room. That happened in the evening in his quiet room when little Adelaide was singing all manner of melancholy songs about love and longing down-stairs. And at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when it was quite quiet, when every one was asleep in the house and only some faint barking of a dog sounded from the tillage, he wandered up and down the room till the lamp grew dim and went out, and even then he did not stop. He no longer expected her to come, though he had done so for days and weeks. At first he had gone to the very walls of her garden with a gnawing desire to see her; he would be there when she came out of the gate, and he would go to meet her at the...", "...more than half a week it'll have to come off your annual vacation.\" \"Thank you, sir, I shan't need more than that,\" said James and the interview was closed. No word was spoken of the reason for James' departure. Jonathan McClellan, founder and owner of the McClellan Automobile Company, knew a thing or two beside how to run an automobile business. He also read the papers. That was on a Thursday. In the course of the evening James conducted an interview with his friend Laffan and at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> or thereabouts he took train for Chicago. He proceeded next day to New York, and thence, on Saturday, to New Haven, arriving there early in the afternoon. He went straight from the station to the law offices of Messrs. Raynham and Rummidge and remained there upwards of half an hour. Every sign of satisfaction was visible on his face as he emerged, but Raynham, who escorted him to the outer door, seemed not nearly so well pleased. \"I wish you'd change your mind, even now,...", "...on the door-step the whole of the time, until he had effected an entrance for her. I went to the pantry window, and saw where the wires had been torn away, not roughly, but neatly; and I knew it must have taken a long time to accomplish. I fell in with the child's prayer, and did not speak of what had occurred; not even to Patience. This is the first time it has escaped my lips.\" \"So you deemed it desirable to conceal such an adventure, and give the prisoner opportunity to renew his <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> visits?\" retorted the counsel for the prosecution. \"What was done could not be undone,\" said the witness. \"I was willing to spare the scandal to the child, and not be the means of spreading it abroad. While I was deliberating whether to tell Patience, seeing she was in so suffering a state, news came that Herbert Dare was a prisoner. He had been arrested the following morning, on the accusation of murdering his brother, and I knew that he was safe for several weeks to come....", "...drawing- room, he was sleek, silken, and caressing as Cupid, after plaguing the Nymphs, at the feet of Psyche. These two strange persons had indeed apparently that sort of sentimental familiarity which is sometimes seen between a fair boy and a girl much older than himself; but the attraction that drew them together was an indefinable instinct of their similarity in many traits of their several characters,--the whelp leopard sported fearlessly around the she-panther. Before Olivier's <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> conference with his son, Gabriel had drawn close and closer to Lucretia, as an ally against his father; for that father he cherished feelings which, beneath the most docile obedience, concealed horror and hate, and something of the ferocity of revenge. And if young Varney loved any one on earth except himself, it was Lucretia Clavering. She had administered to his ruling passions, which were for effect and display; she had devised the dress which set off to the utmost his...", "...night the animals were corralled inside our circle of wagons in order that they might be ready when the hour came for us to set off, and for the first time since I had known Eben Jordan I saw an expression of anxiety upon the lad's face. Wherever one looked among our people he could see gloomy faces, and there was no more singing of \"Joe Bowers,\" no whistling and joking among the lads, as was usually the case during an evening in camp. BREAKING CAMP AT MIDNIGHT When <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> came, I had a very good idea that there was more danger to be met in crossing the desert than I had been willing to believe, for we were awakened and told that the march would be begun in half an hour. Father urged mother and us girls to eat and drink heartily while we might. When I asked him why we were to set off at such an unusual hour, he replied in a serious manner that from the moment we started until the desert had been crossed, there would be no halt made unless...", "...for the troops to do, in case of an assault, but to rise and take their position a few steps in the rear of the fires around which they had reposed. The guard of the night consisted of two captain's commands of forty-two men, and four non-commissioned officers each; and two subaltern's guards of twenty men and non-commissioned officers each--the whole amounting to about one hundred and thirty men, under the command of a field officer of the day. The night was dark and cloudy, and after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> there was a drizzling rain. It was not anticipated by the governor or his officers, that an attack would be made during the night: it was supposed that if the Indians had intended to act offensively, it would have been done on the march of the army, where situations presented themselves that would have given the Indians a great advantage. Indeed, within three miles of the town, the army had passed over ground so broken and unfavorable to its march, that the position of the...", "...face showed how she suffered. It was rare sport for the Mohammedans. \"Jump,\" they would say to the Christians; \"don't be afraid; Christ will save you!\" It was four P.M. when the last of these miserable people, who ought to have been at home hoeing potatoes, left the ship. An hour later a long dark line of smoke was stretching out across the plain of Sharon, behind a locomotive drawing a train of stock cars. These cars held the seven hundred pilgrims bound for Jerusalem. It will be <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when they arrive at the Holy City, and they will have no money and no place to sleep. Ah, I forgot. They will go to the Russian hospice, where they will find free board and lodging. It is kind and thoughtful in the Russian church people to care for those poor pilgrims, now that they are here, but it is not right nor kind to encourage them to come. It will be strangely interesting to them at first, but when they have seen it all, there will be nothing for them but idleness....", "...water beneath them tossed and hissed in rage at its bed being so shaken. Nancy's hand sought her companion's with a reassuring pressure, for speech was impossible. But Elizabeth had only been unprepared. She recovered herself and smiled her thanks. Then she sat down again with her face toward the city and watched this cannonade, terrible to men grown grey in the service, as officers from the fleet bore witness, and to the enemy deadly. For the fascine battery had opened fire. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> General Pepperell sent for Archdale to detail him for special service the next day. \"Why! what's the matter?\" he cried, looking at the young man as he came into the tent. \"Nothing, General Pepperell. I am quite ready for service,\" replied Stephen haughtily. \"Ah!--Yes. Glad of that,\" returned the General, and he went on to give his orders, watching the other's pale face as he did so, and reading there strong emotion of some kind. When he was alone, and his dispatches...", "...the preciseness of a foreigner: \"Now I have you, sir. Now I shall kill you, sir.\" In that instant Johnny prepared himself for his final earthly sensation. He had recognized the voice of the Russian. There came a click, then a snap. The next instant the revolver which had rested against his forehead struck the frozen roof of the mine. The weapon had missed fire and, between turns of the cylinder, Johnny's good right hand had struck out and up. The light snapped out, and in the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> darkness of that icy cavern the two grappled and fell. Had Johnny been in possession of the full power of his left arm, the battle would have been over soon. As it was they rolled over and over, their bodies crushing frozen bits of pay-dirt, like twin rollers. They struggled for mastery. Each man realized that, unless some unforeseen power intervened, defeat meant death. The Russian fought with the stubbornness of his race; fought unfairly too, biting and kicking when...", "...sharp swords. But the Prince was free, and was no longer shut up in it. Then she said good-bye to her father, and took a little money with her, and went again into the great wood to look for the iron stove; but she could not find it. She sought it for nine days, and then her hunger became so great that she did not know how she could live any longer. And when it was evening she climbed a little tree and wished that the night would not come, because she was afraid of the wild beasts. When <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> came she saw afar off a little light, and thought, 'Ah! if only I could reach that!' Then she got down from the tree and went towards the light. She came to a little old house with a great deal of grass growing round, and stood in front of a little heap of wood. She thought, 'Alas! what am I coming to?' and peeped through the window; but she saw nothing inside except big and little toads, and a table beautifully spread with roast meats and wine, and all the dishes and...", "...seaman, I hurried on with the satisfactory intelligence to the works, where I found my father leaning on his spade, pretty well tired out by his unusual exertions. The light of the lantern I brought, however, enabled us to proceed, and he recommenced digging with as much energy as before. As we were running backwards and forwards, I could see numerous other lights all along the line, within a few yards of each other, marking the spots where the people were working. It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> before our task was concluded. Not one of us had felt hungry or thirsty. My father then insisted on our returning home, and on our way we left Lancelot and Dick at their respective homes. We found Audrey and Margaret sitting up for us, both looking somewhat pale, naturally supposing that if the finishing of the earthworks was so important, immediate danger was to be apprehended. Supper over, we knelt in prayer, which, on all occasions and under all circumstances, was our...", "...that I ought to have steered to the south. Now follow the course from the Bay of Whales in 1912. Only in about 75deg. S. was ice seen (almost as in 1911), and we followed it. After that time we saw absolutely no more ice, as the chart shows; therefore in the course of about a month and a half all the ice that we met when going south had drifted out. The stippled line shows how I assume the ice to have lain; the heavy broken line shows what our course ought to have been. The <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sun was not seen till the night of January 7, 1912, to the south of lat. 77deg. S.; it was already 9.5deg. above the horizon. On the night of January 8 we arrived off the Barrier in extremely bitter weather. South-westerly and southerly winds had held for a few days, with fair weather; but that night there was thick snow, and the wind gradually fell calm, after which a fresh breeze sprang up from the south-east, with biting snow, and at the same time a lot of drift-ice. The...", "...Keedysville until Saturday; but the name of the lady furnished a clue by which we could probably track him. A telegram was at once sent to Mrs. K--, asking information. It was transmitted immediately, but when the answer would be received was uncertain, as the Government almost monopolized the line. I was, on the whole, so well satisfied that the Captain had gone East, that, unless something were heard to the contrary, I proposed following him in the late train, leaving a little after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> for Philadelphia. This same morning we visited several of the temporary hospitals, churches and school-houses, where the wounded were lying. In one of these, after looking round as usual, I asked aloud, \"Any Massachusetts men here?\" Two bright faces lifted themselves from their pillows and welcomed me by name. The one nearest me was private John B.

Goethe in his conversations with Eckerman expressed great admiration of Delacroix's interpretations of scenes in \"Faust\" (the brawl in Auerbach's cellar, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> ride of Faust and Mephistopheles to deliver Margaret from prison). Goethe hoped that the French artist would go on and reproduce the whole of \"Faust,\" and especially the sorceress' kitchen and the scenes on the Brocken. Other painters of the romantic school were Camille Roqueplan, who treated motives drawn from \"The Antiquary\" and other novels of Walter Scott;[6] and Eugene Deveria, whose \"Birth of Henry IV.,\" executed in 1827, when the artist was only twenty-two years of...", "...by the sea-shore, And some evil may befall her.\" In the misty morning twilight Forth went Panther and the Raven, Searched the forest and the marshes, Searched for leagues along the lake-shore, But they found no trace or tidings, Found no track in marsh or meadow, Found no trail in fen or forest, On the shore-sand found no footprints. Many days they sought and found not. Then to Panther spoke the Raven: \"She is in the Land of Spirits-- Surely in the Land of Spirits. High at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I beheld her-- Like a flying star beheld her-- To the waves of Gitchee Gumee Downward flashing through the ether Thus she flashed that I might see her, See and know my mother's spirit; Thus she pointed to the waters, And beneath them lies her body, In the wigwam of the spirits-- In the lodge of Nebe-naw-baigs.\"[41] Then spoke Panther to the Raven: \"On the tall cliff by the waters Wait and watch with Waub-omee-mee.

They secretly released such of Damophilus's household as were in bonds; they gathered others together, and soon a band to the number of about four hundred were mustered in a field in the neighbourhood of Enna. There in the early hours of the night they offered a sacrifice and swore their solemn compact. They had gathered everything which could serve as a weapon, and when <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> was approaching they were ready for the first attempt. They marched swiftly to the sleeping town and broke its stillness with their cries of exhortation. Eunus was at their head, fire streaming from his mouth against the darkness of the night. The streets and houses were immediately the scene of a pitiless massacre. The maddened slaves did not even spare the children at the breast; they dragged them from their mothers' arms and dashed them upon the ground. The women were the...", "...new encampment, and is presented to Queen Fatima.--Great distress from want of water_. One whole month had now elapsed since I was led into captivity; during which time each returning day brought me fresh distresses. I watched the lingering course of the sun with anxiety, and blessed his evening beams as they shed a yellow lustre along the sandy floor of my hut; for it was then that my oppressors left me, and allowed me to pass the sultry night in solitude and reflection. About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a bowl of kouskous, with some salt and water, was brought for me and my two attendants. This was our common fare, and it was all that was allowed us, to allay the cravings of hunger, and support nature for the whole of the following day: for it is to be observed, that this was the Mahomedan Lent, and as the Moors keep the fast with a religious strictness, they thought it proper to compel me, though a Christian, to a similar observance. Time, however, somewhat reconciled me to...", "...my way to my rooms. On removing the silk and the wax which had protected me from the powerful drug, an indescribable odour which permeated my clothes ascended to my nostrils; aromatic, yet pungent and penetrating; I never smelt anything that it reminded me of, but I presume the compound contained something of the nature of an opiate. I took some books down to Isaacs' rooms and passed the evening there, unwilling to leave him to the care of an inquisitive servant, and five minutes before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I awoke him in the manner he had directed. He seemed to be sleeping lightly, for he was awake in a moment, and his first action was to replace the vial in the curious safe. He professed himself perfectly restored; and, indeed, on examining his bruise I found there was no swelling or inflammation. The odour of the medicament, which, as he had said, seemed to be very volatile, had almost entirely disappeared. He begged me to go to bed, saying that he would bathe and then do...", "...marble: Then her voice's music ... call it the well's bubbling, the bird's warble!

The two lyrics, _Home-Thoughts, from the Sea_ and _Home-Thoughts, from Abroad_, were written during Browning's first Italian journey in 1838; and it seems strange that he did not print them among the _Dramatic Lyrics_ of 1842 but reserved them for the _Dramatic Romances_ of 1845; especially as he subsequently transferred them to the _Lyrics_. They are both notable on account of the strong feeling for England which they express. No great...", "...would carry no impression of menace, approached near enough to make a dash during the night. It was hoped that thus the assault might be so far a surprise as to enable the British to storm from the rear a fort on the heights, to the northeast of the town, and commanding it.

In the meantime the ships-of-the-line would be coming in from the sea, and upon arrival would support the shore movement by bringing their broadsides to bear upon the walls. By <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the frigates were within three miles of the landing-place; but there strong wind and contrary current delayed them, and before they could get within a mile the day dawned. Thus discovered, the hope of surprise was lost. At 6 A.M., when the squadron approached, Troubridge went on board the \"Theseus\" and told Nelson that he thought, if the heights over the fort, in its rear, could be seized, he could yet compel it to surrender. The landing-party was therefore put on shore at...", "...first gang who left the island. The body had never been buried, and to such neglect did the men now ascribe the storms which had lately afflicted them; nor would they rest until the remains of their comrade were placed beneath the earth, when each evidently felt as if some dreadful spell had been removed from his spirit.' Stories of this kind are common everywhere, and are interesting as showing how widely scattered is this piece of superstition. In Sweden the ravens, which scream by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in forest swamps and wild moors, are held to be the ghosts of murdered men, whose bodies have been hidden in those spots by their undetected murderers, and not had Christian burial.[58] In many a Danish legend the spirit of a strand varsler, or coast-guard, appears, walking his beat as when alive.

The intoxicated shearers and the dude kept their concert up till a late hour that night--or, rather, a very early hour next morning; and at about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> they were reinforced by the commercial traveller and Moses, the jeweller, who had been visiting acquaintances aft. This push was encouraged by voices from various bunks, and enthusiastically barracked for by a sandy-complexioned, red-headed comedian with twinkling grey eyes, who occupied the berth immediately above our own.

Now, however pleasant cats' music heard at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> may appear to the pussies themselves, it certainly is not conducive to the sleep of any nervous invalid who may happen to dwell in the neighbouring houses, or very soothing either. \"Mirram found this out to her cost one evening, and so did the kitten as well, for a window was suddenly thrown open not very far from where they sat. \"`Ah!' said Mirram, `that is sure to be some one who is delighted with our music, and is going to throw something nice to us.' \"Alas! alas!...", "...fly in without their knowledge; but none of them could explain the stain of mud. The next morning, again, the princess found another stain of wet mud, and she questioned everyone most carefully; but none could say how the mud came there. The third night the princess determined to lie awake herself and watch; and, for fear that she might fall asleep, she cut her finger with a penknife and rubbed salt into the cut, that the pain of it might keep her from sleeping. So she lay awake, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> she saw a snake come wriggling along the ground with some mud from the river in its mouth; and when it came near the bed, it reared up its head and dropped its muddy head on the bedclothes. She was very frightened, but tried to control her fear, and called out: 'Who are you, and what do you here?' And the snake answered: 'I am the prince, your husband, and I am come to visit you.' Then the princess began to weep; and the snake continued: 'Alas! did I not say that...", "...pardon I now entreat, to help me win the bet. No offence, noble sirs! But this bet was what compelled me to drag you all from Kadolzburg and its charms so early, and induce you to attend me on the reckless ride through the moonlit night.

The weather during this day and the following one, was so exceedingly unfavourable, that not one fit opportunity presented of sending out a boat to fulfil the promise made to the Patagonians, which probably was an equal disappointment to both parties. Whole troops of the natives were seen at the place where the landing had been made, and where, there can be no doubt, another was anxiously expected. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the 11th, the wind having veered to N.E., and the tide having set to the westward, a signal was made for weighing, but unfortunately the cable parted the bits and the hawse, so that the anchor was lost. The sails being set, some way was made next morning; but it was little, however, as the tide soon ran contrary, and could scarcely be stemmed with the light breeze at N.W. This difficulty was removed at noon, about which time the tide ebbed, and favoured their passing the...", "...man, and brought him and laid him on Val Galbraith's bed. The traveller examined the wounds in the shoulder and the head, and said: \"The head is all right. If I can get the bullet out of the shoulder he'll be safe enough--in time.\" The surgery was skilful but rude, for proper instruments were not at hand; and in a few hours he, whom we shall still call Sergeant Tom, lay quietly sleeping, the pallor gone from his face and the feeling of death from his hand. It was near <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when he waked. Jen was sitting beside him. He looked round and saw her. Her face was touched with the light that shone from the Prairie Star. \"Jen,\" he said, and held out his hand. She turned from the window and stood beside his bed. She took his outstretched hand. \"You are better, Sergeant Tom\"? she said, gently. \"Yes, I'm better; but it's not Sergeant Tom I am any longer, Jen.\" \"I forgot that.\" \"I owed you a great debt, Jen. I couldn't remain one of the Riders of...", "...her, when, with a soft stoop of her bow to some invisible heave of the ocean, she broke her way onwards, dissolving quickly into the night. 'About forty miles distant,' said Mr. Blundell, stepping to the compass. 'Shall we head on a course for her, sir?' 'Oh, most certainly!' answered Captain Parry. 'Better jog along under easy canvas, till it comes daylight, anyhow,' said the mate. The course was shifted, sail trimmed, the gaff foresail was set, and the schooner, carrying the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> breeze abeam, slided soundless through the gloom over the black, wide swell of the sea. Captain Parry was too anxious to take rest. He lighted a cheroot, and paced the deck with Mr. Blundell, who had heroically resolved not to turn in that night--not to turn in at all until the timber-laden derelict had been sighted, boarded and rummaged. They kept the lanterns burning in the rigging. They never knew how it might be with the eight men and the lady, supposing the lady with...", "...of those in the rear was encumbered by piles of the dead.

At the same moment the French cavalry came dashing upon the batteries in the rear, and the bridge was carried. The French army now poured across the narrow passage like a torrent, and debouched upon the plain. Still the battle raged with unmitigated fury. The Austrians hurled...", "...received much encouragement at every step of the way. You, on the other hand, have labored in a private way. I have wrought in the day--you in the night.

It is really a beautiful thing to see those various trains, awaiting their departure, side by side upon the tracks.

When under the royal ban, remorseless as the will of fate, the house of Douglas was expelled from its native heath, a woman of unusual nobility suffered death in the general disaster to her kin. Gratitude is not a virtue of kings, or else there would have been some remembrance of that earlier lady of the Douglas line, Catherine Douglas, who, when the assassins upon <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> murder bent appeared at the chamber of the queen of James I., opposed to their entrance--fruitlessly, indeed, but none the less nobly--her slender arm, which she thrust into the staple to replace the bar that had been treacherously removed. The ambition of the Douglases, however, knew no bounds, and in actual fact their power often not only rivalled but overtopped that of the crown. The feud, with varying degrees of irritation and occasions of outbreak, had gone on until the...", "...It was the design of Jessuron that the two Cubanos should remain in that safe asylum--as guests of the Coromantee--until such time as he might find an opportunity for shipping them back to the country whence they had come.

THE MIDNIGHT TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY. Old Philadelphia had fallen into her <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> nap. Since Howe's time there had been a more decorous rule, and the taverns closed early. There were no roystering soldiers flinging their money about and singing songs in King George's honor, or ribald squibs about the rebels, and braggart rhymes as to what they would do with them by and by. Everything, this October night, was soft and silent. Even party people had gone home long ago, and heard the watchman sing out, \"Twelve o'clock and all is well!\" Only the stars were...", "...And the next morning came the \"waking up\" for which Dowie had so long waited and prayed. But not as Dowie had expected it or in the way she hard thought \"Nature.\" She had scarcely left her charge during the night though she had pretended that she had slept as usual in an adjoining room. She stole in and out, she sat by the bed and watched the face on the pillow and thanked God that--strangely enough--the child slept. She had not dared to hope that she would sleep, but before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> she became still and fell into a deep quiet slumber. It seemed deep, for she ceased to stir and it was so quiet that once or twice Dowie became a little anxious and bent over her to look at her closely and listen to her breathing. But, though the small white face was always a touching sight, it was no whiter than usual and her breathing though low and very soft was regular. \"But where the strength's to come from the good God alone knows!\" was Dowie's inward sigh. The...", "...doomed to an ignominious death, slept sweetly between the armed men.

But innumerable prayers have been read and offered up which have not...", "...as of one hearing of another's debauch; and I would be glad to shake the little bony culprit that I was then. My uncle was away so much of the time that I doubt if he knew how I spent my nights. My aunt, poor hard-worked housewife, knew too little of books to direct my reading. My cousins were not enough older than myself to play mentors to me. Besides all this, I think it was tacitly agreed, at my uncle's as at home, that Mashke was best let alone in such matters. So I burnt my <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> lamp, and filled my mind with a conglomeration of images entirely unsuited to my mental digestion; and no one can say what they would have bred in me, besides headache and nervousness, had they not been so soon dispelled and superseded by a host of strong new impressions.

It would be hard to do anything to hurt Billie herself, for, whatever her faults, Rose was not a sneak. But she might make use of Amanda---- It was several days later--the day that had been set for the greatest of all adventures, a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> feast in the dormitory. It was Billie who had arranged it all, and although the feast itself was by no means a new idea, she had thought up something to make it a little more interesting and daring. Each girl had been instructed to learn some little piece or poem which she was to recite on the great occasion. Some of the girls protested on the ground that they were poor at memorizing, but Billie had been firm. \"No recite, no eat,\" she had said; and so the girls, some...", "...Node:epoch, Next:[4598]epsilon, Previous:[4599]EOU, Up:[4600]= E = epoch n.

Of course the first thing that presented itself to Mortimer's consideration was the engineering of Plank's matrimonial ambitions. Clearly the man had not changed. He was always at Sylvia's heels; he was seen with her in public; he went to the Belwether house a great deal. No possible doubt but that he was as infatuated as ever. And Quarrier was going to marry her next November--that is, if he, Mortimer, chose to keep silent about a certain <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> episode at Shotover. It was his inclination, except in theory, to keep silent, partly because of his native inertia and unwillingness to go to the physical and intellectual exertion of being a rascal, partly because he didn't really want to be a rascal of that sort.

And if this overtasking the mind is so injurious to the body, what will our women of the next generation be if things go on with us as they are doing at present? I must just quote again from the same authority. Dr Richardson says, `If women succeed in their clamour for admission into the universities, and like moths follow their sterner mates into the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> candle of learning, the case will be bad indeed for succeeding generations; and the geniuses and leaders of the nation will henceforth be derived from those simple pupils of the Board schools who entered into the conflict of life with reading, writing, and arithmetic, free of brain to acquire learning of every kind in the full powers of developed manhood.'\" \"You make out a very gloomy case and prospect for us,\" said Mrs Prosser sadly and thoughtfully. \"I do,\" replied the...", "...lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there: and he will tell thee what thou must do. 3:5.

Even this did not suggest to Biddy a visit to a \"hasheesh den,\" for various other plans had been broached and discouraged by \"Antoun.\" She did not feel that, as she was not supposed to know his real status, she could go \"blabbing\" to him; and fearing that mischief was on foot, she had wished for me. When I didn't arrive, she soothed herself by reflecting that, after all, she need only keep a sharp watch over Monny when <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> drew near. None of the party intended to dance, and so it would be easy, Brigit thought, to \"have an eye upon the girls.\" Monny had bought Oriental costumes for herself and Rachel.

But the driver's habitual demand for two and one-half times the proper fare by distance proved in this instance quite fruitless. Staff calmly counted out the right amount, put it in the man's hand, listened with critical appreciation to the resultant flow of profanity until it verged upon personality, then deliberately dragged the man by the scruff of his neck, choking and cursing, from his seat to the sidewalk. \"Now, listen,\" said he in a level tone:...", "...a similar standard.

About an hour before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the two moons passed each other in the Eastern sky; both gibbous at the moment, like our Moon in her last quarter.

These pauses should be as manifest to the ear, as those which are indicated by the comma, semicolon, or other grammatical points, though not commonly denoted by any visible sign.

Every hour of the voyage seemed burdened with novelty, and ceaseless vigilance possessed every faculty.

The rough and barren islands which we passed in our <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> course often exhibited one side glorified with gorgeous roseate hues, while casting sombre and mysterious shadows behind them, which produced a strangely weird effect, half of delight, half of awe, while the long superb trail of sunlight crept towards us from the horizon.

Now, however, that I spent all my evenings in my own quiet room, I became, by imperceptible degrees, interested in the unseen inhabitant of the adjoining apartment. Sometimes, when the house was so still that the very turning of the page sounded unnaturally loud, and the mere falling of a cinder startled me, I heard her in her chamber, singing softly to herself. Every night I saw the light from her window streaming out over the balcony and touching the evergreens with a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> glow. Often and often, when it was so late that even I had given up study and gone to bed, I heard her reading aloud, or pacing to and fro to the measure of her own recitations. Listen as I would, I could only make out that these recitations were poetical fragments--I could only distinguish a certain chanted metre, the chiming of an occasional rhyme, the rising and falling of a voice more than commonly melodious. This vague interest gave place by-and-by to active curiosity....", "...this time was greater than ever before--216 actual fighting ships passed slowly before the royal yacht--there were no flags, no bunting, no holiday crowds, no smart dress for officers and men. Instead, the fleet was drawn up ready for battle, with decks cleared, guns uncovered, steam up, and magazines replenished. During the tense weeks in which the war clouds gathered over southern Europe this great fighting force remained in the British home waters, and when, at fifteen minutes after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on August 4, \"Der Tag\" had come, this fleet sailed under sealed orders.

It was then that Mary sat up in bed straining her ear-drums until she thought they would crack; but the only sound that reached her was a little soft _creaking_ sound. A moment later, she was lying flat again, breathing regularly, for the feet were returning to pause by her door and the light of a candle flickered in. At last the gentle opening and shutting of another door, and the creak of the iron bed under a heavy body told that Sister Joanna had finished her <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> prowlings. It was Mary's turn to get up. For a full hour, she stood listening in the darkness and in the end she heard the stertorous breathing of a stout, tired woman fallen heavily asleep.

Sir Magnus had written to friends in London, and the friends in London bore out the reports that were so conveyed.

It was then that the presidents of the two classes made speeches that were masterpieces of diplomatic art, and the Seniors contributed their share of entertainment with rare stunts. The eccentricities of teachers were taken off in a way that convulsed the entire gathering; the Junior class song was sung for the first time, and <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> crept on without any one dreaming of its approach until faithful John, the janitor, announced it from the door exactly on the stroke of twelve.

It...", "...to strike, lest he might take the life of a companion in hiding, he stooped down, and found a goat with her kid stretched on the ground. He soon saw that the animal was in great pain, and feeling her body and limbs, found that her leg was broken. He bound it up with his garter, and offered her a share of the bread beside him; but she put out her tongue, as if to tell him that her mouth was parched with thirst. He gave her water, which she drank readily, and then ate some bread. After <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he ventured out of the cave. All was still. He plucked an armful of grass and cut some tender twigs, which the goat accepted with signs of great joy and thankfulness. The prisoner took a great deal of comfort in having a living creature in his dungeon, and he caressed and fed her tenderly. The man who was trusted to bring him supplies fell sick; and when another tried to enter the cavern, the goat furiously opposed him, presenting her horns in all directions, till the...", "...28, at 5 p.m., in lat. 65 deg. S. and long. 171.5 deg. E., it was reported that we were off the pack. I was a good deal surprised, as recent expeditions had not met the pack until 66.5 deg. S., or about one hundred nautical miles farther south, nor had there been any sign of our being so near the ice. The wind for the last few days had been south-easterly, but for the moment it was calm; we therefore held on to the east along the edge of the pack, with the ice to starboard. About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the wind freshened from the north, and we lay close-hauled along the edge of the ice till midday on the 29th, when the direction of the ice became more southerly. The northerly wind, which gradually increased to a stiff breeze, was good enough for getting us on, but it must inevitably bring fog and snow in its train. These came, sure enough, as thick as a wall, and for a couple of days we sailed perfectly blindly. Outside the pack-ice proper lie long streams of floes and...", "...he reasoned with himself most earnestly from one end of the trolley line to the other, and called himself all kinds of a fool, but it did not the slightest particle of good. Underneath all the reasoning, he knew he was glad that he had found her once, and he determined to find her again, and to unravel the mystery. Then he sat looking long and earnestly into the depths of the beautiful white stone she had given to him, as if he might there read the way to find her. A little after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he arrived at the club-house, secured his suit-case and the hat-box, and took a cab to his home. He left the vehicle at the corner, lest the sound of it waken his mother or sister. He let himself silently into the house with his latch-key, and tiptoed up to his room. The light was burning low. He put the hat-box in the farthest corner of his closet, then he took out the rain-coat, and, slipping off his shoes, went softly down to the hall closet. In utter darkness he felt...", "...flame Ran reddening through the blushing bowers, Now haggard as her naked shame. One secret thought her soul had screened, When prying matrons sought her wrong, And Blame stalked on, a mouthing fiend, And mocked her as she fled along. And now she bore its weight aloof, To hide it where one ghastly birch Held up the rafters of the roof, And grim old pine-trees formed a church. 'Twas there her spring-time vows were sworn, And there upon its frozen sod, While wintry <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> reigned forlorn, She knelt, and held her hands to God. The cautious creatures of the air Looked out from many a secret place, To see the embers of despair Flush the gray ashes of her face. And where the last week's snow had caught The gray beard of a cypress limb, She heard the music of a thought More sweet than her own childhood's hymn. For rising in that cadence low, With \"Now I lay me down to sleep,\" Her mother rocked her to and fro, And prayed the...", "...head-dresses than I had yet seen them wear, were sweeping along one on each side of her and cackling their welcomes in French, whilst the Baroness was looking about her in a way so gentle as to baffle all description, nodding graciously first to one and then to another, and then adding in her flute-like voice a few German words in the pure sonorous dialect of Courland--all this formed a truly remarkable and unusual picture, and my imagination involuntarily connected it with the ghostly <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> visitant,--the Baroness being the angel of light who was to break the ban of the spectral powers of evil. This wondrously lovely lady stood forth in startling reality before my mind's eye. At that time she could hardly be nineteen years of age, and her face, as delicately beautiful as her form, bore the impression of the most angelic good-nature; but what I especially noticed was the indescribable fascination of her dark eyes, for a soft melancholy gleam of aspiration shone in...", "...by religious terrors: and I regret to say, that I had upon that night an opportunity of witnessing a fatal instance of it. After having washed ourselves in the dark waters of the lake, we entered this famous prison, which is only a naked, unplastered chapel, with an altar against one of the sides and two galleries. On entering this place, a scene presented itself altogether unparalleled on the earth, and in every point of view capable to sustain the feelings raised in the mind by the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> scenery of the lake as seen during the ablutions. The prison was full, but not crowded; for had it been crowded, we would have been happy. It was, however, just sufficiently filled to give every individual the pleasure of sustaining himself, without having it in his power to recline for a moment in an attitude of rest, or to change that most insupportable of all bodily suffering, uniformity of position. There we knelt upon a hard ground floor, and commenced praying; and again...", "...than by mentioning an incident that occurred some months after our union. This was my discovery, wholly by accident, that my love, in whose society I had almost constantly been, had not the least idea what was the color of my eyes, or whether my hair and complexion were light or dark. Of course, as soon as I asked her the question, she read the answer in my mind, but she admitted that she had previously had no distinct impression on those points. On the other hand, if in the blackest <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I should come to her, she would not need to ask who the comer was. It is by the mind, not the eye, that these people know one another. It is really only in their relations to soulless and inanimate things that they need eyes at all. It must not be supposed that their disregard of one another's bodily aspect grows out of any ascetic sentiment. It is merely a necessary consequence of their power of directly apprehending mind, that whenever mind is closely associated with...", "...standard of your holiness.\" And then the visitors retired appeased and edified. Naturally his own Brethren were the first and chief to benefit by the holy Prior's charity and zeal. He denied himself to none; he made himself all to all. Sometimes he gave a spiritual conference after Compline, and then perhaps he would be so carried away as he enlarged upon the goodness of God and the bliss of heaven, for instance, that neither he nor his listeners would note the passage of time. The <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> Office bell would surprise them still hanging upon his words. But such was the fervour infused by his burning eloquence that not one felt the loss of the three or four hours' accustomed sleep.

And as he slept there took place about him a drama that would have set his heart beating with excitement could he have witnessed it. The house was silent; the city clock had tolled the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour, when Gerald came into the room, bearing a shaded lamp. The sleeper lay on his back, locked in the slumber of exhaustion. The visitor, moving with the noiselessness of a shadow, glided to the opposite side of the bed, and, placing the lamp on a chair, slowly turned up the flame and tilted the shade. In an instant the strong profile of the sleeper flashed upon the wall.

Having slowly counted thirty I opened my eyes, and looked about me. This, and not the fevered moment when first I had looked upon the room with the golden door, seemed to be my true awakening, for about me was comprehensible world, the homely streets of London, with deserted Portland Place stretching away on the one hand and a glimpse of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> Regent Street obtainable on the other! The clock of the neighboring church struck one. My mind yet dull with wonder of it all, I walked on to Oxford Circus and there obtained a taxicab, in which I drove to Fleet Street.

That so black a man should have borne the name of White was one of the few of such familiar misfits to which the world never becomes insensible from familiarity.

There were besides in the house two of his gentlemen, Cornaton, afterward his biographer, and La Bonne; his squire Yolet, five Switzers belonging to the King of Navarre's guard, and about as many domestic servants.

This did not sound very hopeful. After <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on a pitch-dark night we arrived in Chatham. We could see nothing. All the lights were masked in consequence of a recent Zeppelin raid. Nothing could be heard but the rattle of rifles and bayonets. Now and then the silence was broken by a muffled word of command.

Guttierez perceiving it, and calling to Salcedo, comptroller of the fleet, all three saw it in motion, as if it were carried from place to place.

In other words, we count the time of day by referring to passed periods and not current periods. This is the method used in reckoning astronomical time.

He recollected old Sam's terrible agitation on the day when he recognised John Adams leaning against the railings of the Park.

To his secretary knowledge he had spent two nights that very week in walking the streets of London from <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> until dawn, ostensibly to do charitable actions to the homeless, but in reality because his mind was becoming unbalanced by the constant strain of not knowing from one moment to another when Adams would deal his staggering blow.

The following evening he provided himself with an iron tool and wrench, and had nearly succeeded in opening the tomb, when the sexton, who was come to ring the bell for <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> prayers, hearing a noise, hastened to the place, and found the unfortunate Marriotto hard at his work; taking him to be a robber of the tombs, he halloed lustily, \"_stop thief, stop thief!_\" that all the fraternity were soon down into the church, some in their night-caps, others in their shirts; and although he was in tatters, he was immediately recognised to be Marriotto Mignelli.

Half-way to Furnes the road was lit up by a motor-car which had caught fire, and which stood blazing in the middle of the road.

There was no moon, but the stars shone out all the more brilliantly as we spun along on the great Ypres road.

There is some influence which seems to haunt the empty places where men once lived, but it broods in redoubled force over the places where men have died. In those wards, now so dark and silent, we had worked for all the past days amid sights which human eyes should never have seen, and the groans of suffering we had heard seemed to echo through the darkness.

It rose above the ripple of the waves, above the screaming of the birds, finally stilling the coronach, and the air it gave an utterance to was the same that had often charmed the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> bower, failing at the last abruptly as it had always done before. \"By heavens! it is my Mary's favourite air, and that was all she knew of it,\" said Doom, and his face grew white with memory and a speculation. \"Had he found the end of that air,\" said Count Victor, \"he had found, as he said himself, another man.

Jerrold was utterly vulnerable; his belief in Maisie's indifference had been his only protection against remorse. How was he going to bear Maisie's wounding love? How would he take the knowledge of it? Anne saw what must come of his knowing. It would be the end of their happiness. After this they would have to give each other up; he would never take her in his arms again; he would never come to her again in the fields between <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and dawn. They couldn't go on unless they told Maisie the truth; and they couldn't tell Maisie the truth now, because the truth would bring the pain back to her poor little heart. They could never be straight with her; they would have to hide what they had done for ever. Maisie had silenced them for ever when she got her truth in first. To Anne it was not thinkable, either that they should go on being lovers, knowing about Maisie, or that she should keep her knowledge to...", "...o'clock at night, when no one of us would ever think of wanting or taking any such articles upon our stomachs in our own homes? If we were all of us in the habit of having a regular repast at that hour, it might be well enough to enjoy one with our neighbor; but the party fare is generally just so much in addition to the honest three meals which we have eaten during the day. Now, to spend from fifty to one, two, or three hundred dollars in giving all our friends an indigestion from a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> meal seems to me a very poor investment. Yet if we once begin to give the party, we must have everything that is given at the other parties, or wherefore do we live? And caterers and waiters rack their brains to devise new forms of expense and extravagance; and when the bill comes in, one is sure to feel that one is paying a great deal of money for a great deal of nonsense. It is, in fact, worse than nonsense, because our dear friends are, in half the cases, not only no...", "...along at a speed of about three knots. It was now nearly ten o'clock at night; the moon rode high in the heavens, which were flecked here and there by small patches of fleecy scurrying cloud; the fog had drifted away, leaving the atmosphere delightfully pure and clear, so that, narrow as was the channel down which we were winding our way, we had no difficulty in steering clear of all obstruction. As we crept down the lagoon we gradually got a truer breeze and more of it, so that by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we found ourselves just passing out of the Conconil lagoons and entering Santa Clara Bay. We now had a fine rattling breeze, which we expected would carry us across the bay and out through the Barcos Channel within the next hour, but, to Courtenay's and my own inexpressible chagrin, Carera now informed us that, in order to escape the possibility of a second rencontre with the frigate we had fallen in with on our passage up, he had determined to go to the westward, returning...", "...In crossing the Ba-Fing the canoe was upset, with three men in it, one of whom was drowned.

At Koeena, on the 2d July, they were much annoyed by three lions, which, after prowling about all day, at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> attacked the asses, which broke their ropes, and rushed in among the tents. One of the lions approached so near that the sentry made a cut at it with his sword. They could not sleep, because of the noise of the hippopotami which infested that part of the river. At this time several of the soldiers strayed, and never came up with the party again, though muskets were frequently fired to give intimation of the route. Next day one of the soldiers became so exhausted that he could...", "...find more ease.

Three immense sleighs filled with a joyous and laughing party went down the avenue, bandying songs from one sleigh to the other.

The richness of their armor and attire showed them to be warriors of noble rank, and their leader had a lofty and prince-like demeanor. For two nights and a day the cavalcade made its way through that rugged country, avoiding settled places and choosing the most solitary passes of the mountains. Their hardships were severe, but campaigning was their trade and their horses were of generous spirit. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when they left the hills and rode through darkness and silence to the city of Granada, under the shadows of whose high walls they passed to the gate of the Albaycin. Here the leader ordered his followers to halt and remain concealed.

He has been in the raw places of the earth, where the desert beasts have whimpered their unthinkable psalmody, and their eyes have shone back the reflex of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> stars--and he can immerse himself in the tending of an incubator. It is horrible and wrong, and yet when I have met him in the lanes his face has worn a look of tedious cheerfulness that might pass for happiness.

These trials all made one, were links in a chain, and took place within a space of time variously estimated from ten to twenty hours. The general order of events may be thus briefly described: (1) About eleven o'clock on the evening of April 6th, A.D. 30, Jesus and eleven of the Apostles left the scene of the Last Supper, which had been celebrated (probably in the home of Mark) on the outskirts of Jerusalem, to go to the Garden of Gethsemane. (2) Jesus was arrested about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in Gethsemane by a band of Temple officers and Roman soldiers guided by Judas. (3) He was first taken to Annas, and was afterwards sent by Annas to Caiaphas. A private preliminary examination of Jesus was then had before one of these church dignitaries. St. John describes this examination, but does not tell us clearly whether it was Annas or Caiaphas who conducted it. (4) After His preliminary examination, Jesus was arraigned about two o'clock in the morning before the...", "...are subservient; they do not jar continually as in Madrid, perhaps the most commonplace of Spanish cities. In Seville you cannot forget the Moriscoes, and the part they played in the making of the city, the memories of Christopher Columbus, the art of Velazquez and Murillo, the romances of Cervantes, and the traditions of the Mother Church of Christendom. Every step causes reflection upon the past. You are carried back to the Middle Ages from the ringing of matin bells till the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> cry of the watchman. The costume of the Sevillian _caballero_--and remember that every man in Spain is a cavalier--has suffered, no doubt, in picturesqueness since the time of Don Quixote. But there is a real grace and a romantic charm in the winter _capa_, flung upon the shoulders, with one of its plenteous folds muffling the mouth, and another thrown back to show the gorgeous lining of amber, green, or crimson. One looks for the point of a scabbard, containing a good...", "...last words to him ere they parted, and so obliterate any suggestion of needed confession lurking behind his own words with which he had left him, he now addressed him with an _abandon_ which, gloomy in spirit as he habitually was, he could yet assume in a moment when the masking instinct was aroused in him-- \"Oh, Mr. MacLear,\" he said jocularly, \"I am glad you have just managed to escape breaking the Sabbath!

We should have liked to go on till <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> or later even, working by moonlight, for it was full moon and very clear weather just then, but this mamma would not hear of. And Hoskins in her sensible way pointed out how much more nicely and neatly we could finish it all by daylight with the straw and packing cloths all tidied away, which she would 'see to' first thing in the morning.

I got out my Graflex and caught several pictures of this flash-light of flame, but none that will be as vivid, as lurid, or as lasting as the flash-light that was etched into the film of my memory. The next flash-light of flame came bursting out of midnight darkness on the island of Java. We were bound for old Bromo, that giant volcano of Java.

His presence there, and the information given him by Colonel Hurry, a Scottish deserter, provided Rupert with an opportunity for making one of those daring raids which have immortalised the name of that dashing cavalry leader. Essex had made a futile endeavour to capture Islip. The same afternoon, with a force of about a thousand men, Rupert sallied out, hoping to cut off a convoy which was bringing L21,000 from London to Essex's army.

He then proceeded to Chinnor, within two miles of Thame, and again successfully surprised a force of the enemy. It was now time to look out for the convoy. The alarm, however, had been given. The drivers were warned by a countryman, and they turned the heads of their team into the woods, which clothed the...", "...in these, and although the grumblings and growlings which rose and fell over the field recalled the angry murmuring of the sea and were disturbing, I was so exhausted that I soon fell sound asleep.

It was a strange feverish time, a sort of chaos, in which the most violently opposed feelings, thoughts, suspicions, hopes, joys, and sufferings, whirled together in a kind of hurricane.

There were nuts to gather as well, and merry parties haunted the woods for them. Oh, what glorious days these were, quite enough to inspirit any one! Then without much warning a great fleecy wrap of snow fell over everything, but the sledging and the shouting had as much merriment in it. Gaspard Denys did not want Renee to go to <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mass at Christmastide. \"Oh, I am so much bigger and stronger now,\" she said. \"I am not going to be such a baby as to take cold. Oh, you will see.\" She carried her point, of course. He could seldom refuse her anything. And the next morning she was bright enough to go to church again.

If I can settle this thing up nice and friendly I would do so.\" They shook hands, and Abe retraced his steps to the hotel, where he again inquired for Marks Pasinsky. \"He hasn't come back yet, Mr. Potash,\" the clerk said, and Abe retired to the writing-room and smoked a cigar by way of a sedative. From six o'clock that evening until <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he smoked so many sedative cigars and made so many fruitless inquiries at the desk for Marks Pasinsky, that his own nerves as well as the night clerk's were completely shattered. Before Abe retired he paid a farewell visit to the desk, and both he and the clerk gave vent to their emotions in a great deal of spirited profanity.

Music stimulates and satisfies the mind in any of its whims, and you can tune it to a softly chanted prayer, or to a dance orgy; to a hymn of exultation, or a tinkling serenade; a kindergarten song, to the bloodthirst of armies; to voluptuous desires that cannot or dare not be worded, or to raptures distilled of every human dross; to cynical raillery, or the very throb of a young lover's heart; to the hilarity of a drinking song, or the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> elegies of ineffable despair.

In such fear the folks in Hennebon remained five days.

At length her voice took up the theme. The silvery thread became song, and through all the opposing, supporting harmonies she led it to the solution of a close in which the only sorrow was in the music itself, for its very life is an 'endless ending.'

Robert wandered out as in a dream.

The concert which the Duchess had announced did not begin, and it was growing late. The artistes, it was said, had not yet come, and all were as impatient as possible, when an excellent orchestra was heard.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a report was circulated among the guests that the Duchess was fatigued at the reception of so many persons, and the _habitues_ said that her efforts to make her guests happy had been so great that she would not sing, and the entertainment would conclude with a ball.

Look at the Music-piece by Titian--it is 'all ear,'--the expression is evanescent as the sounds--the features are seen in a sort of dim _chiaroscuro_, as if the confused impressions of another sense intervened--and you might easily suppose some of the performers to have been engaged the night before in Mask or <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> serenade Which the starved lover to his mistress sings Best quitted with disdain.\" (HAZLITT: _Criticisms on Art_, edition 1843, p. 10). Perhaps it is indeed a travelling party of musicians practising for a serenade.

The customs of society, of course, have changed, and without the hardships and exposure to which Ruth was subjected, every intelligent woman will find something to do.

It marked the site of a cabin burned long ago, and in such melancholy wise as it might it told of the home that had been. Now and again far-away lightning flashed on its fireless hearth; a vacant bird's-nest in a cranny duplicated the suggestions of desertion; the cold mist crept in and curled up out of the smokeless flue with a mockery of semblance. The fire that had wrought its devastating will in the black <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in the deep wilderness, so far from rescue or succor, had swiftly burned out its quick fury, and was sated with the humble household belongings. The barn, rickety, weather-beaten, deserted, and vacant, still remained,--of the fashion common to the region, with a loft above, and an open wagonway between the two compartments below,--and it was here that the inquest was held.

Soon after this, the founders of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> meeting movement consulted him about that project, to which he gave his hearty support. Upon the first night he gave away the invitations, and for that purpose penetrated places into which no one but himself dare have entered with that object.

If so, farewell, I will intrude no more upon thy time or patience. The curtain has fallen, the dim, misty curtain, and memory has turned her golden key, closed her portfolio, and sat down with folded hands, to brood over her hoarded treasures, placing each in its proper place, to be brought forward again at her mandate, to beguile, perchance, other weary <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hours with their magic spell. The past cannot be redeemed, and the future is hid in uncertainty; but the present, the golden present is ours, and while our little bark is floating upon the stream of time, let us improve the precious moments as they fly, and spend them in a cultivation of the best affections of the human mind.

Then Ivan Golik made him a huge whip of the twenty poods of hemp and the twenty poods of tar. First he twined tightly a pood of hemp, and tarred it well with a pood of pitch; round this he plaited another pood of hemp, and tarred that also with another pood of pitch, till he had used up the whole forty. By <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> his task was done, and then he laid him down to sleep. But the prince had gone to sleep long before in the pig-sty.

It was Beth's sporting instinct that had made her evade the question. When she had won the game, and the excitement was over, she felt she had been guilty of duplicity, and determined to confess when Miss Clifford sent for her next and gave her a good opportunity. She would have gone at once but for the dread of losing the precious liberty that was life to her. All through the weeks that followed she kept herself sane and healthy by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> exercises in the moonlight. Her appetite had failed her till she took to this diversion, but after her second ramble she was so hungry that she went down to the kitchen boldly to forage in the hope of finding a crust. The fire was still burning brightly, and by its light she discovered on the table the thick bread and butter for the next morning's breakfast, all cut ready, and piled up under covers on the dishes. There was half a jug of beer besides, doubtless left from the...", "...for one side as the other. D.W.] The singular mood which has been recorded of a high-spirited officer of the garrison, Captain Corey, illustrated the horror with which such scenes of carnage were regarded by noble natures. Of a gentle disposition originally, but inflamed almost to insanity by a contemplation of Spanish cruelty, he had taken up the profession of arms, to which he had a natural repugnance. Brave to recklessness, he led his men on every daring outbreak, on every perilous <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> adventure. Armed only with his rapier, without defensive armor, he was ever found where the battle raged most fiercely, and numerous were the victims who fell before his sword. On returning, however, from such excursions, he invariably shut himself in his quarters, took to his bed, and lay for days, sick with remorse, and bitterly lamenting all that bloodshed in which he had so deeply participated, and which a cruel fate seemed to render necessary. As the gentle mood subsided,...", "...front. By June 16 numerous towns and villages were taken by the Germans. The Wolff Telegraphic Bureau announced that Von Mackensen's army had captured 40,000 men and 69 machine guns, which undoubtedly referred to all the Galician groups, for on June 12, 1915, Von Mackensen had \"replaced\" the Archduke Frederick as generalissimo of the Austro-Hungarian armies. The \"phalanx\" was pressing against Rawa-Ruska, Magierow, and Janov; Boehm-Ermolli against Grodek, part of which he captured by a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> assault on June 16. In five weeks the Russian line or front in Galicia had shrunk from 300 miles to about 100. Before Dunajec, when it was united with the northern groups, it had represented the longest battle line in the history of the world. The Russians began to evacuate Lemberg about June 17, 1915, the day Von Mackensen's right entered Javorov. On the 19th his advance guard was approaching Rawa-Ruska. Boehm-Ermolli was meanwhile undergoing severe punishment near...", "...of them, and her wild heels clicked twice on the floor. \"I am innocent! Oh, I am innocent!\" People pity those who need none, and the guilty sob alone; but innocent or guilty, this girl's scream described such a profound depth of woe--it was so graphic of grief, that it slit with a dagger's sweep the curtain of common-place, and disclosed the gloom-shrouded spectre that sat in the young girl's heart so plainly, in so universal a tone of the mind, that a man heard expressed some far-off <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> terror of his own thought.

He thought that there no one could overhear them. Rameses threw a mantle over his shoulders, put on sandals unfastened and commanded to light the golden hall brightly. Then he went out, directing the servants not to go with him. He found Nikotris in the hall; she was wearing coarse linen garments in sign that she was mourning.

The books, the paintings, and the statue of Washington, he was to send to New Orleans; he was then to evacuate Baton Rouge and retire with his whole force to New Orleans. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the 6th of August Paine arrived at Baton Rouge.

[304] The impression, which this interesting passage leaves on my mind, is that the Chief-Pilot prefers in his narrative to gloss over an incident which must have been full of disappointment to himself. Further on in the narrative, he writes more freely on the subject (page 237). In Note IX. of the Geographical Appendix, I have given some further remarks on this passage. \"At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the following Monday, when all were asleep, the General ordered Gabriel Munoz and myself to go with some soldiers and make an entrance into a town in order to seize some Indians for interpreters (_para lenguas_).

We then returned to the ships; and straightway we made preparations for prosecuting our voyage. \"On the 11th of August of the same year, we left the Puerto...", "...but they had come back from the cemetery to stay. And stay they did, the rent being paid. High rents, slack work, and low wages go hand in hand in the tenements as promoters of overcrowding. The rent is always one fourth of the family income, often more.

He has his standard: 400 cubic feet of air space for each adult sleeper, 200 for a child. That in itself is a concession to the practical necessities of the case. The original demand was for 600 feet.

No one was allowed to leave the room, for fear that intelligence might be communicated to the Jesuits.

The whole line of the army remained quiet on the 7th, only a few skirmishes along different parts of the line, relieving the monotony of the day. The two days of fighting had told fearfully upon our ranks. Our regiments which a few hours before...", "...this being a rendezvous, and a terminus for the busy world--that's something you've heard the townsfolk here saying. Yes--they're in the habit of saying that sort of thing. Arnholm. Well, frankly, I've noticed that, too. Bolette. But really there's not an atom of truth in it. Not for us who always live here.

I suppose it does look ridiculous, and I'm sorry; but I can't grow old gracefully, so long as I am just as ready to effervesce as I ever was.\" Bethany was amused at the half-reproachful, half-indulgent look that Miss Harriet bestowed on her sister. \"They'll be a constant source of entertainment,\" she thought. \"I wonder how we ever happened to drift together.\" Something of the last thought she expressed in a remark to the...", "...the writer continues: \"Your lordship will scarce believe me that the ladies of greatest quality suffer themselves to be treated in one of those taverns, where a curtezan in other cities would scarcely vouchsafe to be entertained; but you will be more astonish't when I shall assure you that they drink their crowned cups roundly, strain healths through their smocks, daunce after the fiddle, kiss freely, and tearm it an honourable treat.\" He furthermore says they were to be found until <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in company with their lovers at Spring Garden, which seemed to be \"contrived to all the advantages of gallantry.\" From which evidences it may be gathered, that London under the Commonwealth was little less vicious than under the merry monarch.

As they approached they saw a bonfire on an adjoining eminence, and lights in the town, and, rowing up abreast of it, there was a sudden eruption of lights, and every indication that the townspeople, instead of being quietly a-bed, were very wide awake. The Indian pilot negatived the notion that this was some saint's-day celebration, and thought that \"it must be an alarm\"; very possibly the wily pilot had something to do with it! While they lay off they heard a...", "...he said pleasantly, \"our American cousins call it a 'corpse reviver,' but a corpse could not do that, could he, Winter?\" \"I know a few corpses that would like to try.

To be suddenly excluded from the society in which he had so long mixed, and banished from the country where he had lived with such distinction, were indeed deep personal affronts, and not without severe reflection on his conduct and character.

It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when he reached Calais. The packet, which had sailed in the afternoon, had just re-entered the port, driven back by a hurricane that had almost wrecked her. The passengers, overcome with terror, fatigue, and exhaustion, were crowding into the hotel at the very moment of my father's arrival. The gale increased in violence at every instant, and the noise of the sea breaking over the old piles of the harbor was now heard like thunder. Indifferent to such warning, my father sent...", "...whom, Pierre d'Aere and Philippe de Larnat enticed Guillem to the bridge at Alliat by night, seized him, gagged him, carried him off to the mountains, and, after extorting a confession, cast him over a precipice. Worthy lieutenants of Pierre Autier were his brother Guillem and his son Jacques, Amiel de Perles, Pierre Sanche, and Sanche Mercadier, whose names occur everywhere throughout the confessions as active missionaries. Jacques Autier on one occasion had the boldness to preach at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to a gathering of heretic women in the Church of Sainte-Croix in Toulouse, the spot being selected as one in which they could best hold their meeting undisturbed.[117] The work of Geoffroi d'Ablis in Carcassonne seems to be principally directed to determining the protectors and refuges of Pierre Autier. At Toulouse Bernard Gui was energetically employed in the same direction. The heretic was driven from place to place, but the wonderful fidelity of his disciples seemed to...", "...to do; and indeed there is no possibility of keeping up a jolly countenance for such a length of time except on toast-water.\" They accordingly adjourned to the Warden's sanctum, where that worthy dignitary seemed to enjoy himself over his sherry and cracked bones, in a degree that he probably had not heretofore; while Redclyffe, whose potations had been more liberal, and who was feverish and disturbed, tried the effect of a little brandy and soda-water. As often happens at such <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> symposiums, the two friends found themselves in a more kindly and confidential vein than had happened before, great as had been the kindness and confidence already grown up between them. Redclyffe told his friend of Lord Braithwaite's invitation, and of his own resolution to accept it. \"Why not?

The poem begins with Volsung, omitting, therefore, the marvelous birth of that king and the oath of the unborn child to \"flee in fear from neither fire nor the sword.\" The saga makes the wolf kill one of Volsung's sons every night; the poem changes the number to two. A magnificent scene is invented by Morris in the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> visit of Signy to the wood where her brothers had been slain. She speaks to the brother that is left, desiring to know what he is doing: O yea, I am living indeed, and this labor of mine hand Is to bury the bones of the Volsungs; and lo, it is well nigh done. So draw near, Volsung's daughter, and pile we many a stone Where lie the gray wolf s gleanings of what was once so good. (P. 23.)

It is the same with classes and nations. It has been said that genius is the author of invention. Statistics do not support this statement. The facts show that industry is the mother of invention. Struggle, sacrifice and burning <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> oil have produced the cotton gin, the sewing machine, the printing press, the steam engine, the electric motor, the telephone, the incandescent lamp and the other great inventions of civilization. Why is it that most of the able men in our great industries came from the country districts? The reason is that the country boy is trained to work.

Someone proposed a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> stroll about the rock. They strolled. In the morning there was a terrible to-do. The advertisement in diamond work had disappeared!--stolen!--giving satisfactory proof that in those parts, at any rate, the days of King Alfred were now no more.

It is he whose soul should walk all day in the light of God's countenance. But let not this Christian joy be confounded with the boisterous merriment of the ungodly. It is far, very far removed from the mere pleasures of sense. It is not to be sought for in the butterflies of fashion flitting in saloons of gayety, nor in the hoarse laugh of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> bacchanalian revel. It is not the silly trifling of brainless fools, who are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. But it is the calm, the tranquil joy of the soul at peace with God.

It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when I returned to my apartment in a tolerably comfortable frame of mind, and yet as I opened the door to my study I was filled with a vague apprehension--of what I could not determine, but which events soon justified, for as I closed the door behind me, and turned up the light over my table, I became conscious of a pair of eyes fixed upon me.

The wind blew a perfect hurricane, rushing up the thick avenue which led to the Glebe house of Clogheen, driving before it in its fury vast clouds of withered leaves it had collected on its way, and showering them in impotent wrath against the doors and windows of the house, which shook and clattered as if each had its own separate assailant. Midnight--black <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> had passed, and the faint light of a rising moon was beginning to mingle with the disturbed and dismal air. It was no night for mortals to forsake quiet and comfortable beds, and, least of all, delicate female invalids; yet Katey Tyrrel, shadowy and wan as a ghost, was standing at this hour watching the roaring tempest from the windows of the conservatory, that looked upon the front lawn of the dwelling.

I think, when we meet again in heaven, after that severance which is inevitable to those who wear a mortal shape, we may feel as we did then, but never before!

An arquebus shot from the town grazed his forehead, and, without inflicting a severe wound, stunned him so much that he lost his balance and fell head foremost towards the ground; his leg, which had been wounded at the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> assault upon Paris, where he stood at the side of King Henry, caught in the ladder and held him suspended. His head was severely bruised, and the contusions and shock to his war-worn frame were so great that he died after lingering eighteen days.

Wordsworth dwelt apart from men, as one who lives far from a public thoroughfare, where neither the dust nor bustle of travel can touch his bower of quiet; in its quality of isolation, Grasmere was an island in remote seas. Keats was a lad, dreaming in some dim Greek temple, listening to a fountain's plash at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> which never whitened into dawn. Nor does there seem to be reasonable room for doubt that poetry, aside from the drama, gains by seclusion and solitude. Much of Bayard Taylor's verse has a delicious flavor of poetry.

XXXV THE MORNING OF MONDAY It has been said that <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> of that Sunday saw the alarm speeding along every road by which the forces of order could hope to be recruited; nevertheless in Bristol itself nothing was done to stay the work of havoc. A change had indeed come over the feeling in the city; for to acquiescence had succeeded the most lively alarm, and to approval, rage and boundless indignation. But the handful of officials who all day long had striven, honestly if not very capably, to restore order, were exhausted; and the...", "...the solid floe, set to the north-west, the cables rattled and tore at the hawse-pipes; luckily the anchors, lying as they were on a strip-sloping bottom, came away easily, without damage to windlass or hawse-pipes.

We were out in the Sound and catching the full force of the wind. The moon broke through the clouds after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and showed us the pack, stretching continuously to northward, and about one mile to the south.

Instead of being near Montreal, as we imagined, we were thunderstruck on finding ourselves, by the fault of our guides, to be only at the distance of half a league from Isle aux Noix: our guide, not knowing the road through the woods, had caused us to turn round continually for twelve hours without advancing!

And he had written it too. I've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence, but too high-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had found time for! But this must have been before his--let us say--nerves, went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> dances ending with unspeakable rites, which--as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I heard at various times--were offered up to him--do you understand?--to Mr. Kurtz himself.

The next coon turned out to be a fat 'possum, and loud were the exclamations of joy on the part of Klem and his comrades when this fact was made plain. Indeed, Maurice believed he would not have taken any great stock in this method of hunting, which seemed so unfair to the game, only on account of the chances it gave the negroes for a square meal in the line of the greatest delicacies they knew. So the hunt went on for several hours. When about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> they concluded to return to the house, seven coons and two 'possums were loaded upon the shoulders of the three attendants.

They led her away, agitated, probably, more by terror than grief, but Mr. Heath remained gazing at the corpse of his only son.

In the middle ages the heir of the house fell in battle, killed perhaps by the shot of an arquebuse or the blow of a partisan; or he met his death in some <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> encounter, and was brought home with a broken rapier and doublet dripping with blood--there is romance in that. But now he falls a victim to the bottle, and furnishes but a vulgar theme. Nevertheless the drama is none the less real. Mr. Heath's contemplation was sad, but full of worldly reasoning.

They travelled as fast as their horses could walk for fully twenty-four hours before they dared make another halt, but they soon found themselves in the country of the Crows, who were friendly with the whites.

The ex-flour dealer of Philadelphia was not satisfied to accept the people's sacred verdict.

The ballot-boxes with their contents were in the sheriff's charge and stored under lock and key in the court-house. The sheriff was an Addicks tool. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he turned over his charge to one of the would-be statesman's trustiest lieutenants, who, with the aid of a lantern and a slip of paper containing the directions, sorted over the legal ballots, threw some out, and put in new ones.

In the course of half an hour it was rewarded. The mad woman--a dangerous creature--who had wandered away from an asylum in the neighbourhood, was found curled up and fast asleep in the lady's own bed!

After walking some time, they sat down at the door of a Casino, and, while Cavigni was accommodating them with coffee and ice, were joined by Count Morano. He sought Emily with a look of impatient delight, who, remembering all the attention he had shewn her on the preceding evening, was compelled, as before, to shrink from his assiduities into a timid reserve, except when she conversed with Signora Herminia and the other ladies of her party. It was near <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> before they withdrew to the opera, where Emily was not so charmed but that, when she remembered the scene she had just quitted, she felt how infinitely inferior all the splendour of art is to the sublimity of nature. Her heart was not now affected, tears of admiration did not start to her eyes, as when she viewed the vast expanse of ocean, the grandeur of the heavens, and listened to the rolling waters, and to the faint music that, at intervals, mingled with their roar....", "...ocean of music rose and fell like the waves of the sea. Count Saxe walked the _minuet de la cour_ with Francezka. It seemed as if this night was to be her apotheosis, for everything seemed designed to show her off and to give her the first place. Monsieur Voltaire did not dance, but overwhelmingly grateful for the ruse by which Francezka had got him to the king's table, could not be too assiduous to her or praise her wit too highly. From that hour she was queen at Chambord. It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> that the ball began. I remained only an hour or two, and then went to my rest, but not in my chamber next Count Saxe's for once. I had not had much sleep for several nights, so I betook myself to the stables, where, upon a pile of oats designed for the morning's feed, I wrapped myself in my cloak and fell into a deep slumber.

Give me five hours and your lordship shall see what I answer.\" As his promise prevented the delivery of the memorial to Las Casas, the Chancellor arranged a table for him in his own apartment where he could compose his reply, advising him to make it in the form of answers to questions supposed to be addressed to him by the King. For four nights Las Casas laboured on his composition until eleven o'clock, at which hour he supped with the Chancellor and afterwards returned at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to his lodging, not without fears for his personal safety, for his enemies were as numerous as they were powerful and sufficiently unscrupulous to use any means for silencing him. No copy exists of these thirty objections and the answers made to them, and Las Casas says that the originals were burned.

Ten minutes' walk from its base a colossal and isolated tree arose, called the chesnut of a hundred horses, because around its trunk, the circumference of which is equal to 178 feet, and beneath its foliage, which of itself forms a forest, a hundred horsemen and their steeds can take shelter. It was at the root of this tree Bruno was to seek the money he wished to borrow of the prince; consequently, about eleven o'clock in the evening he left Centorbi, and towards <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he began to discern by the light of the moon the gigantic tree, and the small house built between its stems, in which its immense produce is harvested. As he drew near, Pascal thought he could distinguish a shadow cast upon one of the five trunks which arose from the same root. Soon afterwards the shade appeared a reality; the bandit stopped, cocked his carbine, and cried, \"Who goes there?\" \"A man, to be sure!\" exclaimed a powerful voice. \"Why, zounds! you did not expect...", "...the emerald green walls of rock, the cloven valleys, the terrible forest wildernesses, and the mountains of Norway dazzlingly illuminated and reflecting themselves like glittering jewels in the quiet waters of sapphire blue lakes, were interesting enough to afford nourishment for more than one landscapist. _Knud Baade_, who worked from 1842 in Munich, after a lengthy sojourn at the Copenhagen Academy and with Dahl in Dresden, delighted in moonlight scenes, gloomy fir forests, and <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> suns.

It was a surprise. There is a law in regard to gaming in Effingham, which makes the penalty heavier if caught gaming during the week; whereas, it is lighter for Sunday. Therefore, being well aware of the fact, no serious anticipation was held as to how the gamesters would be dealt with, since they had been caught after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> Saturday night. In fact, when the excitement attendant with the raid had passed, those directly interested, looked hourly for those who were caught, to be released. \"What'll it cost them under this law?\" inquired Wyeth of Glenview, who appeared to be fairly well informed regarding the matter. \"Oh, not much,\" he replied. \"Perhaps five or six dollars.

As of old, in his weariness he looked to the woods and streams for refreshment, for although poorly adapted to the wringing of his daily bread from the soil, he was nevertheless exquisitely keyed to the harmonies of Nature, and her touch upon his soul was life. It had been long since he had taken an early morning tramp. In the city his <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> retirement forbade the snapping of his hours of rest at dawn, but now that his life was ordered somewhat differently, he could afford himself the luxury of a sunrise. With this plan in mind he retired early after setting the hand of his clock at the hour of four. The alarm went off with a furious bur-r-r that brought him on his feet through sheer astonishment.

That night the eldest brother pitched camp on a hillock not far from the herd and well out of way of the mosquitos. To make the little girl's safety certain, he put her blankets at the center of a square that was roped in by lariats, the stakes being black willows cut from a clump on the river bank. She lay down with the dogs beside her, but, unused to the strangeness of her bed, slept little. The eldest brother stayed with the herd, so she passed the long hours before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> looking up at the stars and thinking. She could hear the yelping of some coyotes that were cautiously reconnoitering from a neighboring bluff. When they came near, the dogs sprang up and challenged them, and soon their cries died away as they slunk down a deep coulee. The dogs quieting again, she caught the sound of faint movements and calls in the grass.

Soon after she came on board, the admiral heard that there was a rich Spanish ship just about putting to sea, and a very good sailer. He knew if she once got ahead of us we should never catch her up, so, without waiting to land Lady Cochrane, we slipped our cables and made sail up to where the treasure-ship and several others of the enemy's vessels lay at anchor. We beat to quarters, and got up to them about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> all ready for action. We were not long in beginning the sport, nor they in returning the compliments we paid them; for, besides the treasure-ship, the Spaniards had some gun-boats moored under their forts.

Getting up muscle, excessive drinking, <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> escapades, and immorality, alluded to more or less openly, are made to play entirely too prominent a part in both stories. In _Fair Harvard_ the brutal foot-ball game (now, we believe, abolished) is depicted without condemnation--except from a young lady, whose judgment the reader is of course expected, with the hero of the story, to disregard--while the disgraceful conduct of the students at Worcester two years ago is narrated as though it were something very \"smart.\" When we...", "...forget how we appeared to our Brethren that night as we came to the narrow doorway leading into the _Saal_, I being in the lead. We could hear the fervent prayers that were being offered for our release and for a moment while the Brethren within were kneeling all unconscious of our nearness, I held up my hand and beckoned the Brethren behind me to wait a moment while we stood there silently gazing upon the bowed forms of the worshipers. I have myself attended more than one of our <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> funerals of some dear Brother or Sister, and though wonderfully impressive and touching to one's heart, even they never touched me more deeply than this impressive sight before us. As we peered into the large _Saal_, with the upper galleries shadowed in darkness, the only light the flickering tallow candles in front of each of our devout Brethren, we saw the dark, mysterious shadows in the corners of the _Saal_ with ourselves standing in such a gloom we were not perceived.

And weight is weight at Liverpool.\" \"She'll do it,\" said Jaggers confidently. \"I'll back my Iroquois against their Berserk--if Berserk he is.\" \"He's Berserk,\" said Chukkers doggedly. \"A blind man at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> could tell that from his fencing.

Before he entered the chamber, he had put on one of his fingers, a gold ring set with a large fine diamond, of the value of, perhaps, thirty nobles. And in playing together, the ring slipped from his finger in the bed without his knowing it. When it was about 11 o'clock, the damsel begged him kindly to dress and leave, that he might not be found by her husband, whom she expected as soon as <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sounded, and that he would guard her honour as he had promised. He, supposing that her husband would return soon, rose, dressed, and left the chamber as soon as the clock struck twelve, and without remembering the diamond he had left in the bed. Not far from the door of the chamber John Stockton met Thomas Brampton, whom he mistook for his host, Richard. Thomas,--who had come at the hour the lady appointed,--made a similar mistake, and took John Stockton for Richard, and...", "...think as little of giving a blow as you or I of drinking a glass of water, and who never strike without having a knife in their hands.

The snug supper room glittered with light, clean linen and shining glass. Now that the theatres were out, it had become awake with the chatter with which these little <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> suppers begin--suppers that so often end in confidences, jealousy and even tears, that need only the merriest tone of a gipsy's fiddle to turn to laughter. Boldi is an expert at this. He watches those to whom he plays, singling out the one who needs his fiddle most, and to-night he was watching de Savignac.

I arrived from Chicago close upon <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> last night, and wrote and sent down my Christmas cablegram before undressing: \"Merry Xmas! Promising progress made in Chicago.\" It would get to the telegraph office toward 8 this morning and reach you at luncheon. I was vaguely hoping, all the past week, that my Xmas cablegram would be definite, and make you all jump with jubilation; but the thought always intruded itself, \"You are not going out there to negotiate with a man, but with a louse. This makes results...", "...\"She is the wife of Senor Ramal. They came here some ten days ago, with letters to one or two of the best families, and that's all we know about them. The senora is an entrancing mixture of Cleopatra, Sappho, Helen of Troy, and the devil. She had the town by the ears in twenty-four hours, and you wouldn't wonder at it if you saw her.\" Already I felt that I knew, but I wanted to make sure. \"Byron has described her,\" I suggested, \"in Childe Harold.\" \"Hardly,\" said Hovey. \"No <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> beauty for hers, thank you. Her hair is the most perfect gold. Her eyes are green; her skin remarkably fair. What she may be is unknowable, but she certainly is not Spanish; and, odder still, the senor himself fits the name no better.\" But I thought it needless to ask for a description of Harry; for I had no doubt of the identity of Senor Ramal and his wife. I pondered over the name, and suddenly realized that it was merely \"Lamar\" spelled backward!

The carrier, with poised wings, now let go its grasp upon her shoulder and slowly, yet with deadly certainty, she slid down into the abyss--to become one of them!

He had performed the last sacred rites for the dying woman; he had knelt at her bedside and committed her soul to the keeping of Him who gave it. It had been a painful scene and he was tired and depressed when he reached home. He entered his wife's room and found her in her easy chair in a dead faint. He hastily summoned Pauline and sent a message for Dr. Eldrige. Mrs. Thorpe was ill, very ill. Dr. Eldrige,...", "...picked men, splendidly armed and equipped, constituted the final raiding force. But the delay gave time for the news that some mysterious movement was afoot to spread far and wide, and Forrest led his corps of hard riders at top-speed from Tennessee to the aid of Rodney in checking it. On the 27th he was in Dodge's front, helping Rodney to give him what trouble he could, though obliged to fall back before his much greater force. Streight was already on his way. He had set out at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> of the 26th, in pouring rain and over muddy roads. At sunset of the next day he was thirty-eight miles from the starting-point. On the afternoon of the 28th the village of Moulton was reached without trace of an enemy in front or rear. The affair began to look promising. Next morning the mule brigade resumed its march, heading east towards Blountsville. Not until the evening of the 28th did Forrest hear of this movement. Then word was brought him that a large body of Union...", "...see that there is anything particularly clever or original about stealing a rowboat in the dead of night,\" said Harriet slowly, \"and I don't believe that the boys would think so either.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> they set sail for Old England. On rising next morning they found themselves far out among the islands of the coast. Soon after that they were out of sight of land,--heaving on the swell of the ocean, thinking over the varied and stirring scenes of the past three months with a sort of feeling that it must have been all a dream, and wishing heartily that they were still away in the far north, enjoying the endless daylight and--_Chasing the Sun_.

In the afternoon Mac did a watch by himself on the bridge for any signals which might be sent. Few came, and it was a sad and lonely bridge deserted after what seemed years at sea. The evening brought unloading of the holds and by the light of great arc lamps stores of all sorts were piled high. It was past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> before the winches were silent. Before four in the morning the few remaining troops were again astir, and by daybreak were all on the quay with their equipment. The ship on which were the squadron's horses lay about two miles away, and they set out for her. Mac was very sick, probably for unwisely sampling Turkish delight sold him yesterday by an Egyptian at the ship's side. Unaccustomed boots, a cobbled street and a heavy load did not add to the pleasures of the march....", "...that I had been ill; and indeed my wretched appearance almost warranted such an assertion. In vain I waited that evening for news from Ahmed; but I did not learn from him till two days afterwards, that the Arabs had reconsidered the matter, and had come to the conclusion that the risk of recapture was too great, and had returned to their homes instead of coming to the place of rendezvous. So we had completely failed, and considered ourselves lucky to have returned unnoticed from our <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> ramble. Again I informed my Cairo friends of what had happened. They were unsparing in their efforts, and had now the valuable aid of Father Ohrwalder, who, when in Vienna, had visited my family, and had obtained from them some ether pills, which are very strengthening on a journey, and ward off sleep.

Two guns of the Volunteer Battery were in difficulties in an advanced position near the river bank and just behind the first-line trenches. They had been under heavy rifle and maxim fire at two hundred yards range, and were enfiladed from over the river. The guns were thus rendered unworkable. I was to take two gun teams and a G.S. wagon at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to retrieve them. This meant crossing the main _maidan_ in the open without an inch of cover. It meant going almost under the rifles of the enemy scarcely two hundred yards off, and being visible in any sort of light to the enemy over the river. A guide was to await me at twelve midnight, near the battery. I arranged for the teams and wagon to be there at 11.40 p.m., and for all links, swingle-tree hooks, drag-washers, and pole-bar to be bound up with rag so as to render...", "...on a little section of the great highway.

And with the darkness, the whole horizon became brilliant with cannon fire. V We were well within the horseshoe of German fire that surrounded the French lines. It was between <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and one o'clock, the sky was deep and clear, with big ice-blue winter stars. We halted at a certain road to wait our chance to deliver our wounded. It was a _melee_ of beams of light, of voices, of obscure motions, sounds.

There was constant skirmishing between the enemy's cavalry and artillery and each of the columns up to the 31st, as the army advanced, getting into position. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the 30th, Stanley moved with part of his command to Lavergne, where the enemy's cavalry was interfering with the trains. At 9.30 he was ordered by General Rosecrans to hasten to the right and cover McCook's flank. On reaching there he found McCook's new line formed on the Nashville road, when the enemy's skirmishers advanced and drove Stanley's dismounted cavalry out of the woods to the open field.

Next, the attempted murder of Mr. Carrington, and, finally, the discovery that the master of Durley Dene had visited the grounds of the Manse at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> for some mysterious purpose as yet unknown.

The water for drinking was obtained at a pure spring up the hill of the Three Pines which rose not far off from the camp. At present, as the greater number of the girls were still busy in their tents, the vicinity of the lake was agreeably solitary. As the three girls sat down Louise Miller said suddenly: \"There is a legend of a lake where every night at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a maiden arises bearing in her hands a silver bowl.

A clergyman often has three or four of these farmers' churches in his district, and he holds occasional services in them. It is a custom, when the farm-house has not proper guest-chambers, for travellers to sleep in the church, and _we_ did so in that at Silfrastathr, Miss Hastie using her own tent as usual.

Next day we made an early start, for we got away soon after ten o'clock, in order to ford the river before the melting snow caused the waters to rise.

This temperature-testing had caused some fun, for in using my sling...", "...king had forbidden, on pain of death, the burial of Polynices. But Antigone had a love which overcame all fear. Memories of mutual affection in days of innocence thronged her thought, and steeled her heart to defiance of the cruel law.

After much search she came upon the dear object of her daring, and made in the ground a little space to serve her end.

Altogether the streets are quieter; models, in fact, of peace and good order: when the anarchical element is loose it seems to prefer the interior of Colleges. Various reasons might be assigned for this: sometimes the presence of too easily defied authority gives a piquancy to crime; or it is the place itself which is the incentive. The open space of a quadrangle is found to be a convenient stage for the performance of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> reveller.

Hammerfest, too, is interesting, not only because it is the most northerly town in the world, and because \"in the season\" it is crowded with representatives of all nations, who come here to trade, but because here you are within the limits of the region of the Midnight Sun, and from here you will take your boat (unless you continue by the Vadsoe steamer) for the North Cape. The effect of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sun has been variously described. Carlyle revels in the idea that while all the nations of the earth are sleeping, you here stand in the presence of that great power which will wake them all; Bayard Taylor delights in the gorgeous coloring; and each traveller has some new poetic thought to register. For myself the midnight sun has a solemnity which nothing else in nature has. Midnight is solemn in the darkness; it is a hundredfold more solemn in the glare of sunlight, richer...", "...as dark as Egypt. My progress, therefore, was slow. A boy went with me as far as the main road, and, after seeing me under way, he left me to my own devices. The horse was very aged, and, I fear, a little rheumatic. Besides, I have reason to believe that he was blind. That did not make any particular difference, though; for the darkness was so intense, that eyes were as useless as they would be to the eyeless fishes of the Mammoth Cave. I don't intend to prolong my description of this <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> ride. Suffice it to say that the horse walked all the way, and, although it was midnight when I started, it was near morning when I reached my quarters. I hurried at once to the doctor, and, to his intense disgust, roused him and implored his services.

True, it was but a peach that she had craved; but it had been no small deed to glean a peach at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> from that wintry city where yet the February snows lay like iron. She had asked for a peach; she was his bride; in his pocket the peach was warming in his hand that held it for fear that it might fall out and be lost. On the way the Kid turned in at an all-night drug store and said to the spectacled clerk: \"Say, sport, I wish you'd size up this rib of mine and see if it's broke.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I sat down on the windlass to take a short rest, and began talking to one of the men, Fred Borders by name. He was one of the quietest and most active men in the ship, and, being quite a young man, not more than nineteen, he and I drew to one another, and became very intimate. \"I think we're goin' to have a breeze, Bob,\" said he, as a sharp puff of wind crossed the deck, driving the black smoke to leeward, and making the fire flare up in the try-works. \"I hope it won't...", "...endure for ever--yea, even to the great Day of Judgment.

In the radio room Ike Green got in...", "...THE INFLUENCE OF SABBATH SCHOOLS. \"Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined,\"--is an adage as true as it is ancient. One's character, happiness, and usefulness, during his whole life, depends, in no small measure, upon early education. The child taught to disregard the Sabbath, and lightly to esteem the instructions of the Sabbath school, grows to manhood devoid of aught that can entitle him to the society and respect of the good and virtuous. With a soul shrouded in <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> darkness, he gropes his way through life, and at the grave sinks into oblivion, \"by none esteemed, by all forgot.\" However we may hope for such a soul, through the mercy of God, as we surely do, it is not now qualified to enter upon and fully appreciate the purity and joys of Christ's kingdom. We seldom hear of the execution or imprisonment of one who regarded in youth the Sabbath school. Indeed, I think it impossible for one who has been successfully taught to reverence and...", "...of the house, which they expected to find in great disorder. Nor were their anticipations unfounded. The whole house had been stripped by artful thieves, and the gentleman had decamped without paying for his lodging. It turned out that he was no other than an accomplice of the notorious Arthur Chambers, who was executed at Tyburn in 1706; and that the supposed corpse was this arch rogue himself, who had whitened his hands and face with chalk, and merely counterfeited death. About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he quitted the coffin, and appeared to the maid in the kitchen. When she flew up stairs, he softly followed her, and, seated, at the door of the chamber, he acted as a sentinel, so that his industrious accomplices were enabled to plunder the house without the least molestation.\" [GHOST STORIES.] [Illustration: 327] THE CLOAKS. The following tale is taken from a work by M. Loeve Veimars, entitled 'Les Manteaux.' The scene is laid in Germany, and the story opens...", "...as preparations could be made, the whole party left the villa of the Princess for a retreat in the Alban Mountains, where Agostino and his band had one of their rendezvous. Only the immediate female attendants of the Princess, and one or two men-servants, left with her. The silver plate, and all objects of particular value, were buried in the garden. This being done, the keys of the house were intrusted to a gray-headed servant, who with his wife had grown old in the family. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> before everything was ready for starting. The moon cast silver gleams through the ilex-avenues, and caused the jet of the great fountain to look like a wavering pillar of cloudy brightness, when the Princess led forth Agnes upon the wide veranda. Two gentle, yet spirited little animals from the Princess's stables were there awaiting them, and they were lifted into their saddles by Agostino. \"Fear nothing, Madam,\" he said, observing how the hands of the Princess trembled; \"a...", "...Once only does she raise the cry, for before she can a second time call out, the cloak is thrown over her head, a rough hand is at her throat, and she feels the pressure of a rope as it is deftly whipped about her. There was a momentary struggle; but it soon ceased, for the woman fainted, and was at the mercy of him who had trapped her. Is thy sword caught and useless? thy arm paralyzed? or what causes thee to stand unnerved and trembling? Was it the scream that rang out upon the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> air? Had it the sound of a voice dear to thee even now? The man lifted the light figure of the girl within his arms and hurried away. Aye, Effingston, heaven-sent was the sorrow which drove thee forth to seek solace from the night and stars; but, come, now is thy time! Fear not for him--he has recovered himself--and, snatching his rapier from its sheath, with one or two quick bounds is up with the man, crying: \"By the God above thee, release the woman ere I crush thy...", "...Wines.\" Old Henderson, I should say, could be trusted to know something of local vintages. And so far good. At Licenza, however, Ramage tells us that he \"got glorious on the wine of Horace's Sabine farm.\" I do not know what he means by this expression, which seems to be purposely ambiguous; in any case, it does not sound very nice. At another place, again, he and his entertainer consumed some excellent liquor \"in considerable quantity\"--so he avows; adding that \"it was long past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> ere we closed our bacchanalian orgies, and he (the host) ended by stating that he was happy to have made my acquaintance.\" Note the lame and colourless close of that sentence: he ended by stating. One always ends that way after bacchanalian orgies, though one does not always gloss over the escapade with such disingenuous language. We can guess what really took place. It was something like what happened at Rojate. Did not the curly-haired Giulio end by \"stating\" something to...", "...along the whole line south of Volhynia. Two German armies went to the aid of the Austrians in the region of the Stochod and Styr rivers, and German forces also made a stand before Kovel. The mortality on both sides was described as frightful, but the Russians continued to make headway and the capture of thousands of Teutonic prisoners was of almost daily occurrence, the total reaching 172,000 before June 18. Czernowitz, the capital of Bukowina, fell into the hands of the Russians at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> of June 17, after the bridgehead on the Pruth river had been stormed by the victorious troops of the Czar. One thousand Austrians were captured at the bridgehead, but the garrison succeeded in escaping. The invading troops swept on, crossed the Sereth river, and soon gained control of about one-half of Roumania's western frontier. By July the Austrians were retreating into the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, hotly pressed by the Russian advance. The German army around...", "...being 0\".32, while that of Groombridge 1830 is only 0\".14. With these data the actual velocity across the line of sight can be easily computed. That of the southern star comes out 80 miles a second, while that of Groombridge 1830 is 148 miles a second. The actual velocity of Arcturus is probably still greater. The poet Barton has well said-- \"The stars! the stars! go forth at night, Lift up thine eyes on high, And view the countless orbs of light, Which gem the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sky.

Aitken, the eminent American observer of double stars, finds that of all the stars down to the 9th magnitude--about the faintest visible in a powerful binocular field-glass--1 in 18, or 1 in 20, on the average, are double, with the component stars less than 5 seconds of arc apart....", "...for ears that may hearken to hear his death-conquering song, Till the heart swells to think of the gladness undying that overcame wrong.

And the tale shall be told of a country, a land in the midst of the sea,...", "...I have thought wise to follow? I am strongly inclined to regard it as a true myth, which, in materialistic language, sets forth the close of the day and the extinction of the light. May we not construe the maiden as the Evening Twilight, the child of the Day at the close of its life? The black lover with whom she is fatally enamored, is he not the Darkness, in which the twilight fades away? The countless crowds of Toltecs that come to the wedding festivities, and are drowned before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in the waters of the strangely named river, are they not the infinitely numerous light-rays which are quenched in the world-stream, when the sun has sunk, and the gloaming is lost in the night?

The bright light of one day cannot extend to the next. The bridge is broken by the intervening night, and the rays are lost in the dark...", "...desperate, maddened misery. \"Oh, ye malignant gods!\" he cried fiercely--\"ye immortal Furies that made Woman for Man's torture, ...

They were thinking of their homes and of what was happening there, and many of them, officers as well as men, had not set foot on shore for weeks--months, in some cases. Boxing Day found the squadron at sea. CHAPTER XI. BLACK FRIDAY. I. ''Appy Noo Year, chum,' said the lookout-man on the starboard side of the _Belligerent's_ bridge, as Pincher Martin came up to relieve him at five minutes past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the morning of 1st January.

'Well, th' compliments o' th' season to yer, Shiner White. 'Strewth!' he added, 'it's a bit parky, ain't it?'

The feasters ate till their eyes were rolling lugubriously; and still the kettles came round. The Indians ate till they were torpid as swollen corpses, and still came the white men with more kettles, while the mischievous French lad, Radisson, danced a mad jig, shouting, yelling, \"Eat! eat! Beat the drum! Awake! awake! Cheer up! Eat! eat!\" By <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> every soul of the feast had tumbled over sound asleep, and at the rear gates were the French, stepping noiselessly, speaking in whispers, launching their boats loaded with provisions and ammunition. The soldiers were for going back and butchering every warrior, but the Jesuits forbade such treachery. Then Radisson, light-spirited as if the refugees had been setting out on a holiday, perpetrated yet a last trick on the warriors. To the bell rope of the main gate he fastened a...", "...in the world would sit up all night and work for you while you lie there snoring! And small thanks I get for it, too!\" \"It doesn't look to me like your work!\" said the King's Son significantly. Again the slave reported to him that Osmo was alive and unhurt by the serpents. \"Strange!\" thought the King's Son. He took the embroidered shirt and made the old wise woman another visit. \"Ah!\" she said, when she saw the shirt, \"now I understand! Listen, my Prince: last night at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> I was awakened by the chime of silver bells and I got up and looked out the door. Just there at the water's edge, close to that little boat, I saw a strange sight. A lovely maiden rose from the waves holding in her hands the very shirt that you now have. A little dog that was lying in the boat greeted her with barks of joy. She sang a magic rime to the dog and gave it the shirt and off it ran. That maid, my Prince, must be Ilona.

Before concluding this subject, attention should be drawn to the fact that, in more modern times, this beautiful idea of animating all nature in detail reappears under the various local traditions extant in different countries. Thus do the Oceanides and Nereides live again in the mermaids, whose existence is still believed in by mariners, whilst the flower and meadow nymphs assume the shape of those tiny elves and fairies, who were formerly believed to hold their <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> revels in every wood and on every common; indeed, even at the present day, the Irish peasantry, especially in the west, firmly believe in the existence of the fairies, or \"good people,\" as they are called.

Sometimes a coach would swing into the town carrying sixteen sailors, four inside and twelve out, paid off from a man-of-war and going to London to spend their money. They would walk back. Sometimes a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> coach would bring unhappier passengers; gangs of convicts in chains would be given something to eat at the Red Lion; or the yard gates of the King's Arms would be closed, and armed warders would let out their prisoners for a little rest on the way to Botany Bay. But the sailors were the merry folk. They would brandish their bottles and cheer, and sometimes, when the coach swayed, would swing with it as sailors should on a sloping deck; then the coach turned over.

As soon after such closing of the dance-house as the rooms could be arranged for the purpose, a prayer-meeting was held in the dancing saloon, with the concurrence of Mr. ALLEN and his wife. This meeting was begun at about half an hour after midnight, and continued until one o'clock in the...", "...but they came behind him, and if he hadn't have done so and so, the rascally Italians would have killed him, and so forth.

I know that he was profound in knowledge of trick and vice, and that he had an impediment in his speech--he could never speak the truth. He told a fearful tale of a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> robbery in the Piazza di Spagna--himself the victim. It was well told, and I ought to know, for I read it years before in a romance, only the scene was, in type, laid in Venice. According to this negro-minstrel style of youth, he had been seized from behind, held, robbed of watch and elegant gold chain, red coral shirt-studs, onyx sleeve-buttons, and a porte-monnaie containing fifty scudi, etc., etc. He was the theatrical hero of the hotel for two days, and the recipient of...", "...that of the Portuguese has a direct relation to his proposed subject: the wars of his country, a vast field, in which he has admirably succeeded, without prejudice to the first rule of the epopea, the unity of the action.\" The severest critic must allow that the episode related by Veloso, is happily introduced.

I inquired if the Fish Hawks were plentiful near Great Egg Harbor, and was answered by an elderly man, who with a laugh asked if I had ever seen the \"Weak fish\" along the coast without the bird in question.

Several roads diverged from this spot, and the wagons separated, one only keeping us company. The night was dark and gloomy, but the sand of the road indicated our course very distinctly. Suddenly the galloping of horses struck my ear, and on looking back we perceived that our wagon must in an instant be in imminent danger. The driver leaped off, and drew his steeds aside, barely in time to allow the runaways to...", "...out over a newly-murdered infant. Shriek on shriek, fast and loud and long, broke the slumbers of the village; nothing Abner could do, neither threat nor force, short of absolute murder, would avail,--and there was too much real estate remaining of the Hyde property for Abner Dimock to spare his wife yet. Ben drove fiend-fashion; but before they passed the last house in the village, lights were glancing and windows grating as they were opened. Years after, I heard the story of such a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> cry borne past sleeping houses with the quick rattle of wheels; but no one who heard it could give the right clue to its explanation, and it dried into a legend. Now Hitty Dimock became careless of good or evil, except one absorbing desire to get away from her husband,--to search for her child, to know if it had lived or died. For four nights more that journey was pursued at the height of their horse's speed; every day they stopped to rest, and every day Hitty's...", "...came over him. He made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his own house. But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the pavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his hand was on his arm. \"Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o'clock. Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am off to Paris by the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> train, and I particularly wanted to see you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as you passed me.

So, Mr. Landlord, let the chamber be got ready directly, and have a good fire built there at once.\" The exultant host hurried away to confide the great news to Jo, and with him to make the necessary preparations. \"Come what will, Jo, Colonel Demarion ain't the man to make off without paying down good money for his accommodations.\" In reasonable time, Colonel Demarion was beckoned out of the public room,...", "...most of them lived. In one of the canoes I saw a small chap of thirteen years. He was the chief's son, and already an expert in hunting and in handling the baidarka. So is the Aleut hunter trained. As it had been a very warm day I feared that the skin might spoil. Therefore I concluded to continue to Afognak Place without camping for the night, and so we paddled on and on. As darkness came, the mountains seemed to rise grander and more majestic from the water on either side of us. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we again stopped for tea, and while we sat by the fire the host of baidarkas of the sea otter party silently glided by like shadows. We joined them, for my men had much to tell of their four months with the white hunter, and many questions were asked on both sides. Some miles from Afognak the baidarkas drew up side by side in a long, even line, our baidarka joining in. _Drasti_ and _Chemi_[6] came to me from all sides, for I had from time to time met most of the native...", "...What men of that age eclipsed or equalled the address and daring of those delicate and highborn women? What a romance was their ordinary existence! The Princess Palatine gave refuge to Mme. de Longueville when that alone saved her from sharing the imprisonment of her brothers Conde and Conti,-- then fled for her own life, by night, with Rochefoucauld. Mme. de Longueville herself, pursued afterwards by the royal troops, wished to embark in a little boat, on a dangerous shore, during a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> storm so wild that not a fisherman could at first be found to venture forth; the beautiful fugitive threatened and implored till they consented; the sailor who bore her in his arms to the boat let her fall amid the furious surges; she was dragged senseless to the shore again, and, on the instant of reviving, demanded to repeat the experiment; but as they utterly refused, she rode inland beneath the tempest, and travelled for fourteen nights before she could find another place...", "...to an officer who has performed all his various duties with so much zeal and fidelity.\" Farragut has been charged with failure to notice adequately the services of those under him; but the foregoing words, which are not by any means unparalleled in his dispatches, show that he could praise cordially when he saw fitting occasion. The night of August 4th was quiet, the sea smooth, with a light air just rippling the surface of the water. At sundown it had been raining hard, but toward <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> cleared off, the weather becoming hot and calm. Later on a light air again sprang up from the southwest. The admiral was not well, and slept restlessly. About three in the morning he called his servant and sent him to find out how the wind was.

Returning with difficulty and joined by Marshman and the natives, he had every door and window closed, and then mounting the south roof, he had water poured through it upon the burning mass for four hours, with the most hopeful prospect of arresting the ruin. While he was busy with Marshman in removing the papers in the north end some one opened a window, when the air set the entire building on flame.

Few of the country people passing the house at night but had overheard the old man's weak, reedy voice and Peter's deep, hoarse one, in altercation. When at last--it was on a Sunday night--all was still and quiet in the house; not a word, not a footstep, could be heard, no more than if it were uninhabited, the neighbors looked knowingly at each other, and wondered if the old man were worse--if he were dead! It was a little after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> that a knock came to the door of our cabin. I heard it first, for I used to sleep in a little snug basket near the fire; but I didn't speak, for I was frightened. It was repeated still louder, and then came a cry--\"Con Cregan; Con, I say, open the door! I want you.\" I knew the voice well; it was Peter McCabe's; but I pretended to be fast asleep, and snored loudly. At last my father unbolted the door, and I heard him say, \"Oh, Mr. Peter, what's the matter? Is the ould man...", "...multitude? I watch, but they are long ago departed, Far as the world of day, or as the star; The forest loved her priests, and tranquil-hearted They stole away in dim procession, far Down the unechoing aisles, beyond recalling; The moss grows on the stones, the leaves are falling. In vain I listen for their hissing speech, And seek white holy hands upon the air, They told their worship to the yew and beech, And left them with the secret, trembling there, Nor shall they come at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> nor at dawn; The gods are dead; the votaries are gone.

Indeed at this juncture, there was much underlying apprehension in the minds of good citizens; the situation was unprecedented, men's passions had been wrought up to a fearful pitch, and who could foresee the outcome!

If she finds that in rising at daylight she does not get sleep enough, let her go to bed a little earlier. We ought to sleep about as much before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> as after; and she who goes to bed at eight, and rises at four, will be pretty sure to get sleep enough. Few if any persons over twelve years of age, need more than eight hours sleep; and the greater proportion not so much. Here I will mention one thing which does not seem to be generally known.

Wire fences and horses in pasture made this a task, so it was well after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> before he accomplished it. He made ten miles or more then by daylight, and after that proceeded cautiously along a road which appeared to be well worn from travel. He passed several thickets where he would have halted to hide during the day but for the fact that he had to find water.

His own work at the limits had ditched the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mail. His instructions to Ralph had sent the through freight crashing into the three freight empties at terminus. Finally, exhausted after his mad work at the levers, Bortree had commenced a work of general destruction.

Every <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the indicating stars crossed the thread exactly on time, each night a trifle earlier than the night before by a definite and calculable amount, due to the march of the earth around the sun.

Once, during the night, when he and Conductor Tobin were seated in the caboose eating their <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> lunch, the latter began to sniff the air suspiciously, and even to Rod's unaccustomed nostrils, there came a most unpleasant smell. \"Hot box!\" said Conductor Tobin, and the next time they stopped, they found the packing in an iron box at the end of an axle, under one of the cars, blazing at a furious rate. The journals, or bearings, in which the axle turned, had become dry and so heated by friction as to set the oil-soaked cotton waste, or packing, with which the box was...", "...of ships and shipowners don't amount to much, else you wouldn't talk of Rosewarne's doing me a favour.\" He paused and laughed, not aloud but grimly. \"The _One-and-All's_ insured, Miss Marvin, and pretty heavily over her value. I'd take it as a kindness if you found someone fool enough to insure _me_ for a trip in her.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"No, I reckon you don't. They finished loading her last night, and we moored her out in the channel, ready for the tug this morning. Before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> she was leaking there like a basket, and by seven this morning she was leaking worse than a five-barred gate. The tug had just time to pluck us alongside here, or she'd have sunk at her moorings; and when we'd warped her steady and the tide left her, the water poured out of a hole I could shove my hand through--not the seams, mark you, though they leaked bad enough--but a hole where the china-stone had fairly knocked her open; and the timber all round it as rotten as cheese....", "...as she prayed that if God thought well She there might stand in the gateway, that none might pass into hell.

So blooms as a flower of the darkness a star of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> born, Of the midnight's womb and the blackness of darkness, and flames like morn. Nor yet may the dawn extinguish or hide it, when churches and creeds Are withered and blasted with sunlight as poisonous and blossomless weeds.

As eight bells rang out upon the darkness, and the unsuspecting sailor keeping the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> watch looked blankly into the night, several rowboats, with occupants armed to the teeth, would be lowered, and without a splash ride the waters, over which they glided, carrying the sea-robbers to the grim sides of their intended prey.

A pall of nimbus overspread the sky, and blinding snow commenced to fall. We had become used to blizzards, but on this occasion several factors made us somewhat apprehensive. The ship was at least twenty-five miles from shelter on an open sea, littered with bergs and fragments of ice. The wind was very strong; the maximum velocity exceeding seventy miles per hour, and the dense driving snow during the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hours of semi-darkness reduced our chances of navigating with any certainty. The night of the 23rd had a touch of terror. The wind was so powerful that, with a full head of steam and steering a few points off the eye of the wind, the ship could just hold her own. But when heavy gusts swooped down and the propeller raced on the crest of a mountainous wave, Davis found it impossible to keep steerage-way.

We had camped some distance from the trail, and having taken our horses over the ridge into another ravine, had picketed them on the best grass that could be found. It was my duty to stand guard and watch the horses until midnight. The night was clear and still, and although it was bright starlight, it seemed to be very dark in the ravine. I took a position slightly up the hillside and reclined with ear near the ground. About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> there came seemingly from some very distant source, a low, deep, rumbling roar. For a time it was impossible even to surmise the cause. It seemed to be subterranean and yet it was not an earthquake, for the sound was continuous and gradually increased in depth and power. In a few minutes I became convinced that it was caused by the hoofs of a great number of running horses approaching through the ravine. As a measure of precaution I thought it best to move a little out of the...", "...to oppose their progress; in the very midst of this sea of helmed heads, the envoy was enabled to recognise the martial figure of the Prince of Bearne.

The first Bourbon entered the city through the same gate out of which the last Valois had, five years before, so ignominiously fled. It was a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> surprise, although not fully accomplished until near the dawn of day. It was not a triumphal entrance; nor did Henry come as the victorious standard-bearer of a great principle. He had defeated the League in many battle-fields, but the League still hissed defiance at him from the very hearthstone of his ancestral palace. He had now crept, in order to conquer, even lower than the League itself; and casting off his Huguenot skin at last, he had soared over the heads of all men,...", "...and seemed to have dreams in his fever, for to Soroka's ears came the disconnected words,-- \"Gracious king, pardon--Those men are traitors--I will tell all their secrets--The Commonwealth is a red cloth--Well, I have you, worthy prince--Hold him!--Gracious king, this way, for there is treason!\" Soroka rose on the bed and listened; but the sick man, when he had screamed once and a second time, fell asleep, and then woke and cried,-- \"Olenka, Olenka, be not angry!\" About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> he grew perfectly calm and slept soundly. Soroka also began to slumber; but soon a gentle knocking at the door of the cabin roused him.

With the object of holding the road to Kelley's Ferry, Geary's division was ordered to encamp near Wauhatchie, some three miles up the valley from Howard's position.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a regiment that had been ordered by Howard to hold the Chattanooga road across Lookout Creek, had a slight skirmish with the advance of the enemy. This was a portion of Longstreet's corps getting into position for a night attack on the two encampments.

Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.

For this fickleness (which, however, was partially dictated by political considerations) Louis XII was destined to pay dearly; he was fifty-three years of age and his bride was eighteen; to please her, he changed all his habits of life, and even the hours of his repasts.

Yet, she didn't know what it was that she wanted of him, except to protest at his attitude toward her. Such a protest was due them both--an appeal in behalf of the friendship which meant so much to her--which, she had abruptly discovered, meant far more to her than she supposed. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> she telephoned to Ilse. A sleepy maid replied that Miss Westgard had not yet returned. So Palla called a taxi, pinned on her hat and struggled into her fur coat, and, taking her latch-key, started for Ilse's apartment, feeling need of her in a blind sort of way--desiring to listen to her friendly voice, touch her, hear her clear, sane laughter. A yawning maid admitted her. Miss Westgard had dined out with Mr. Estridge, but had not yet returned.

When the lightning flashed, they could distinguish the huge oaken folding doors, and see that they were shut; but, while darkness was on, a tiny stream of yellowish light projecting through an aperture underneath, told, that a lamp was burning behind it, inside the archway.

The spectacle ought certainly to have the interest of picturesqueness which is inherent in the fortuitous. Unhappily, though there is hurry and rush enough, it is the bustle of business, not the dynamics of what is properly to be called life. The elements of the picture lack dignity--so completely as to leave the _ensemble_ quite without accent. More incidents in the drama of real life will happen before <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to the individuals who compose the orderly Boulevard procession in Paris than those of its chaotic Broadway counterpart will experience in a month. The latter are not really more impressive because they are apparently all running errands and include no _flaneurs_. The _flaneur_ would fare ill should anything draw him into the stream. Everything being adjusted to the motive of looking out for one's self, any of the sidewalk civility and mutual interest which obtain in Paris...", "...faint impression of the town. Here and there we caught a vision of promising arcades, and apparently ancient outlines of houses and gabled roofs, but everything was in tenebrous gloom. Hardly a single window reflected the faintest ray; the streets were deserted.

It was Matonabbee whom the English traders sent up the Saskatchewan to invite the tribes of the Athabasca down to the bay. The Athabascans listened to the message of peace with a treacherous smile. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> assassins stole to his tent, overpowered his slave, and dragged the captive out. Leaping to his feet, Matonabbee shouted defiance, hurled his assailants aside like so many straws, pursued the raiders to their tents, single-handed released his slave, and marched out unscathed. That was the way Matonabbee had won the Athabascans for the Hudson's Bay Company.

The money problem so pressed upon me, in fact, that when I reached my destination at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and discovered that it would cost fifty cents to ride from the station to the college, I saved that amount by walking the entire distance on the railroad tracks, while my imagination busied itself pleasantly with pictures of the engine that might be thundering upon me in the rear.

I found that the crew had been entirely free from scurvy, which had so seriously afflicted the crews of the fleet at Marble Island the previous winter. The entire freedom from this...", "...I feel confident that Rap Molberg is shipping another truck load of stolen wheels out of town.

He had not been lucky that day, or, indeed, for many days, as the haggard eyes that stared out of his white face testified. He had spent the past three nights in the open, but to-night--to-night was cruelly wet. He questioned with himself what he should do. In his pocket was that which might procure a night's lodging or a meagre supper; but it would not supply both. He had to decide between the two, unless he elected to go on playing till <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> in the drenching rain on the chance of augmenting his scanty store. Though it was June, he was chilled to the bone. In the intervals between his flute-playing his teeth chattered. He looked horribly ill, but no one had noticed that.

During that visit, however, he had no chance. Moultrie sat persistently, and so did Abel. The clock pointed to eleven, and still they did not move. It was fairly toward <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when Abel rose to leave, and at the same moment Sligo Moultrie rose also. Abel bade the ladies good-evening, and passed out as if Moultrie were close by him. But that young man remained standing by the sofa upon which Grace Plumer was seated, and said quietly to Abel, \"Good-evening, Newt!\" Grace Plumer looked at him also, with the bright black eyes, and blushed.

[Page 56] \"Go to yon tower, where busy science plies Her vast antennae, feeling thro' the skies; That little vernier, on whose slender lines The <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> taper trembles as it shines, A silent index, tracks the planets' march In all their wanderings thro' the ethereal arch, Tells through the mist where dazzled Mercury burns, And marks the spot where Uranus returns. \"So, till by wrong or negligence effaced, The living index which thy Maker traced Repeats the line each starry virtue draws Through the wide circuit of creation's laws; Still tracks unchanged the everlasting ray Where the dark shadows of...", "...in a neighbourhood, of their boldness as winter began, and their anger if every family were not careful to put money, food, and such things in convenient places near the hearth, so that when the fairies came they could take what they wanted without difficulty. They required great cleanliness of every woman and girl they met with. If care was not taken in these respects, their curse was sure to fall on the family, in years to come. Night was the time when they visited the earth, and from <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> till morning they enjoyed themselves frolicking about hay-fields and marsh-lands. They were very sociable beings. So much so that it was with difficulty they were got rid of once they got their heads into the houses of any neighbourhood. The only way to get rid of them was to throw rusty iron at them. To do this was like spitting in the face of God, the greatest insult you could hurl at them. Away they went at once, never to return except for deeds of vengeance.... It may...", "...unpleasant word Labour.' 'But if you are fortunate in love, you're happy,' said old Lady Castlerich, 'I think I have made my lovers happy.' Harding laughed. 'Happy! for how long?' 'That depends. Love is not a joy that lasts for ever,' the old lady added with a chuckle. 'But did no woman make you happy, Mr. Harding?' asked Lilian, and she fixed her round, prominent eyes upon him. 'The woman who gives most happiness gives most pain. The man who leaves an adoring mistress at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> suffers most. A few minutes of distracted happiness as he drives home. He falls asleep thanking God that he will see her at midday. But he awakes dreading a letter putting him off. He listens for the footstep of a messenger boy.' 'If she doesn't disappoint him?' 'She will disappoint him sooner or later.' 'I have never disappointed you,' said Lilian, still looking at Harding. 'But you have not been to see me.' 'No; I've not been to see you,' she replied, and...", "...an old friend from America--a lucky encounter, indeed, for his is a most gentle, refined, and sensitive nature, and his company and companionship are a genuine refreshment. We knew he had been in Europe some time, but were not at all expecting to run across him. Both parties burst forth into loving enthusiasms, and Rev. Mr. ------ said: \"I have got a brimful reservoir of talk to pour out on you, and an empty one ready and thirsting to receive what you have got; we will sit up till <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and have a good satisfying interchange, for I leave here early in the morning.\" We agreed to that, of course. I had been vaguely conscious, for a while, of a person who was walking in the street abreast of us; I had glanced furtively at him once or twice, and noticed that he was a fine, large, vigorous young fellow, with an open, independent countenance, faintly shaded with a pale and even almost imperceptible crop of early down, and that he was clothed from head to heel in...", "...Virgin's arms, and I think, your reverence, I would like Our Lord coming down to judge us, and I should like to have Him on His throne on the day of Judgment up at the top of the window.\" \"I can see you've been thinking a good deal about this window,\" the priest said. She began again and the priest heard the names of the different saints she would like to see in stained glass, and he let her prattle on. But his temper boiled up suddenly and he said:-- \"You'd go on like this till <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> if I let you. Now, Biddy M'Hale, you've been here all the morning delaying my workmen. Go home to your fowls.\" And she ran away shrinking like a dog, and the priest walked up and down the unfinished church. \"She tries my temper more than anyone I ever met,\" he said to himself. At that moment he heard some loose boards clanking, and thinking it was the old woman coming back he looked round, his eyes flaming. But the intruder was a short and square-set man, of the type that...", "..._camaraderie_; they treat one as fellow-soldier. And as for our men, they fraternize as though the strawberry mark of brotherhood was on every arm. All the insult, all the bitterness and ill-treatment, have come from officers and citizens of high position in society, and from the women, whose envenomed tongues are let loose upon the wounded prisoner without mercy. This space [referring to the space in the diary under the printed date of Saturday, May 24] is the date of our <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> fight on the dark road; and this [Sunday 25] of our fight and flight to the Potomac, when hell broke loose in Winchester town; and this Sunday is just such another, cool and bright; and this morning [Monday, May 26] A, B, E, and K, were left on picket at the fence and in woods, with a section of Cothran, under Lieutenant Peabody.

Encamped beside Life's rushing stream, In Fancy's misty light, Gigantic shapes and shadows gleam Portentous through the night. Upon its <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> battle-ground The spectral camp is seen, And, with a sorrowful, deep sound, Flows the River of Life between. No other voice nor sound is there, In the army of the grave; No other challenge breaks the air, But the rushing of Life's wave.

Chinaman and James Pigg next, and the rest some ten minutes behind. We reached the lunch camp together and started therefrom in the same order, the two crocks somewhat behind, but not more than 300 yards at the finish, so we all got into camp very satisfactorily together. The men said the first march was extremely heavy (T.-(-2 deg.). The sun has been shining all night, but towards <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> light mist clouds arose, half obscuring the leading parties. Land can be dimly discerned nearly ahead. The ponies are slowly tiring, but we lighten loads again to-morrow by making another depot. Meares has just come up to report that Jehu made four feeds for the dogs. He cut up very well and had quite a lot of fat on him. Meares says another pony will carry him to the Glacier. This is very good hearing.

To add to our misfortune we saw the lights disappear, one by one, in the village, till a solitary candle, glimmering from the upper chambers of one or two houses, were our only beacons. We had yet a lodging to seek, and it was near <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> before we reached the door of the principal inn; there, at least, thought I, our troubles for to-night will end; but great was our mortification on being told there was not a spare bed to be had in the house, every one being occupied by emigrants going up to one of the back townships. I could go no further, and we petitioned for a place by the kitchen fire, where we might rest, at least, if not sleep, and I might dry my wet garments. On seeing my condition the landlady took...", "...believe it to be the true one. Wylie and I moved on in the evening, with the horses for two miles, and again pitched our camp among the sand-drifts, at a place where the natives were in the habit of digging wells for water, and where we procured it at a very moderate depth below the surface. Pigeons were here in great numbers, and Wylie tried several times with the rifle to shoot them, but only killed one, the grooved barrel not being adapted for throwing shot with effect. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we arose and moved onwards, following along the beach. I intended to have made a long stage, as I no longer had any fears about not finding water; but at nine miles one of the horses knocked up, and could proceed no farther, I was compelled, therefore, to turn in among the sand-drifts, and halt at five in the morning of the 7th. We were again fortunate in procuring water by digging only two feet under the sand-hills, which were here very high, and were a continuation of those...", "...the strangest creature it had ever been Johnny's lot to behold. As heavy as an ox, but shorter of leg and broader of back, the creature had such a face as an elephant might present had he been robbed of half his trunk. Rage gleamed from his small, black eyes. From his side there protruded the shaft of a spear and this, no doubt, was the cause of his sudden anger. To be snatched from the silence of the jungle to the sudden strain of action is like being dragged from the deep dark of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to the glaring light of day. For a second Johnny stood petrified. Then, born as he was for action, and trained for it, too, he sprang forward. The shoulder straps of his pack were thrown off and the pack struck the trail with a thump. Then, like an ancient warrior, Johnny lifted the light rifle and prepared to stand his ground. \"Look out!\" screamed Jean. \"It's a mountain cow, a tapir. He's mad with pain. He--he'll trample you to death.\" With one hand Johnny pushed her...", "...Forth Greyfell bounds rejoicing, and they see the grey wax red, As unheard the war-gear clasheth, and the flames meet over his head, Yet a while they see him riding, as through the rye men ride, When the word goes forth in the summer of the kings by the ocean-side; But the fires were slaked before him and the wild-fire burned no more Than the ford of the summer waters when the rainy time is o'er.

While he looked about him he saw the doors of the theatre in Broadway pushed open, and the audience began to pour forth. A few moments later little knots of the play-goers passed him, still laughing with remembrance of the farce they had been witnessing. In another quarter of an hour the people began to come out of the other theatre, the variety show on the square, and the lights that flared above the door-way went out, all at once. It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when two men sat down on the bench of which McDowell Sutro had been the sole occupant hitherto. They were tall and thin, both of them; they were clean-shaven; their clothes were shabby; and yet they carried themselves with an indescribable air, as though they were accustomed to brave the gaze of the world. \"No,\" said the elder of the two, continuing their conversation, \"she's no good. She has a figure like a flat-iron and a voice like a fog-horn, hasn't she? Well, there's no...", "...sinking. Raoul, accompanied by Joe, set off from the fort to follow the ships as soon as they withdrew, and shouted gleefully after them: \"Ho, ho! Monsieur Charnace. Your spies did not do you much good, did they? Surely you've learned a lesson this time, and will mind your own business in future.\" When he saw the ships run aground, he hurried back to the fort, and actually had the hardihood to suggest to his aunt that a party, which he offered to lead, should be sent out at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> to try and set the ships on fire ere they were floated again. But Madame wisely refused to sanction any such rash enterprise. \"Charnace will not trouble us any more for the present,\" she said. \"Let him alone; as soon as his ships are repaired he will depart.\" And so it proved. The holes having been hastily caulked, Charnace, profoundly chagrined, yet grimly determined to try again, returned to his stronghold at the Penobscot, and a few days after he disappeared,...", "...Parker's home at Lone Tree, now Central City, and the third night arrived at Grand Island. On the way to Grand Island one of the party accidentally started a prairie fire six miles east of Grand Island. A hard fight was made and the flames subdued just in time to save a settler's stable. Leaving Grand Island on the sixteenth they crossed the Platte river and camped on the West Blue. From this point in the journey the party suffered incredible hardships until their return. About <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the wind changed to the north, bringing rain and sleet, and inside of an hour a blizzard was raging on the open prairie. The horses were covered with snow and ice and there was no fuel for the fires. The men went out as far as they dared to go for wood, being unsuccessful. It was decided to try to follow the Indian trail south--made by the Pawnee scouts under Major North. Little progress could be made and they soon \"struck camp\" near some willows that afforded a little...", "...no notice of where her footsteps led her. Beyond Crieff she wandered, along the river-bank a short distance, ascending a hill, where a wild and wonderful view spread before her. There she sat down upon a big boulder to rest. Her hair blown by the chill wind, she sat staring straight before her, thinking--ever thinking. She had not seen Lady Heyburn that day. She had seen no one. At six o'clock that morning she had written a long letter to Walter Murie. She had not mentioned the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> incident, but she had, with many expressions of regret, pointed out the futility of any further affection between them. She had not attempted to excuse herself. She merely told him that she considered herself unworthy of his love, and because of that, and that alone, she had decided to break off their engagement. A dozen times she had reread the letter after she had completed it. Surely it was the letter of a heart-broken and desperate woman.

The game went back to the $100 basis, and was comparatively uninteresting for an hour or so. In the course of the play during this time Tunwell caught four queens pat--a very remarkable thing--and got 50 only out of the hands. But unlike what most poker players would do under such circumstances, he didn't throw down the hand face upward on the table with an oath. He wasn't that kind of poker player. \"Just about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> both men simultaneously decided upon a bluff--and it's not often that men happen to do this in a two-handed poker game; when they do, something always drops.

No revelation has burst upon the silence of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> darkness which has brooded over the nations. Or, if such voice, such vision, such Prophet has occasionally burst forth with the testimony of Jesus, the spirit of prophecy, his testimony has been unheeded by the mass of the people called Christians, his voice silenced in death, or himself and his followers have been banished from society, to wander in the mountains, forests, caves, or deserts of the earth; or, on the other hand, compelled to drag out an existence in the...", "...Island, in the river about two miles from this place, was the home of a ghost. The stories concerning the movements of the alleged spook were, of course, not given any credence at first, but later, when several reputable citizens of Hardin announced that they had positively seen an uncanny looking object moving about on the island at night, the rumors were more seriously considered. Now, after investigation, the mysterious something is no longer considered a myth. Along toward <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> a peculiar light is seen at the foot of the island. It has the appearance of a huge ball of fire, and is about the size and shape of an ordinary barrel. A few nights ago a party of young men from this place determined to visit the island and fathom the mystery if possible.

He felt his chances diminish, however, when about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> an extra guard was put round the prison. Something had gone amiss in the matter of his rescue. Three things had been planned. Firstly, he was to try escape by the small window of the dungeon. Secondly, Carterette was to bring Sebastian Alixandre to the prison disguised as a sorrowing aunt of the condemned. Alixandre was suddenly to overpower the jailer, Mattingley was to make a rush for freedom, and a few bold spirits without would second his efforts and smuggle him to...", "...their long attendance on the royal captive, contracted a respectful affection for him. Harrington, indeed, had been speaking out so openly in praise of his Majesty's conduct in the Newport Treaty, and of the talent he had shown in his debates with the Presbyterian divines, that those who were in charge had thought it unsafe to let him remain in the service. He had therefore been dismissed, and the duty of immediate waiting on the King had been left entirely to Mr. Herbert. It was at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> on the 16th or 17th of December that this gentleman, asleep in the little room he occupied next to the King's chamber, was roused by hearing the drawbridge outside let down, and some horsemen enter the Castle.

Late in the evening we came upon a group of tents by the roadside--Rosecrans's head-quarters, with Rosecrans himself, and not in the best of humors, as some of us discovered on riding up to see friends on his staff. In his petulance and excitability the commanding general forgot to be gentlemanly, some of them said; and they left him not at all relieved of any doubts they had concerning our sudden and forced march. It was long after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when we reached Gordon's Mills. Here the road was full of ambulances, wagons, artillery and infantry, while in the thickets on the left were heard the confused noises of the bivouac. There were no fires, which showed that we were supposed to be in the immediate presence of the enemy, and that our commander did not want his position revealed by camp-fires. At some distance past the mills Palmer's division was halted in the road, and the troops were massed by regiments, and...", "...as the Colonel promised me a real Kentucky dinner; that settled it.

It was a high, spring tide, compelling us to occasionally abandon the beach where covered with water, and take to the scrub, much to the evident fear of the negro, who, I soon discovered, was very timid and superstitious.

The crane flew all night, as usual. He passed the sleeping humming bird at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and was well on his way before he was overtaken. The humming bird flew as long as he could see, and before midnight he was again ahead. Each night the humming bird slept.

The risk, however, was not so great as it seemed, so long--and here was the danger--as we did not lose our way in the village and turn into a blind alley. After an hour or more along a good road we came on a light railway and followed that for some time, standing aside, I remember, at one place, to let a train pass.

Krumbach was on the route that we knew, so, leaving it on our left, we cut across country to our right, through some extremely wet crops, and hit the main road west of Krumbach.

The Professor said we could reach New England by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> if the wind held and it didn't grow cloudy; but alas! for the past hour we had been watching a little fleecy nebulous bit of mist that seemed, like a spirit, to spring from the nothingness of the blue ether, growing constantly, and attracting other cloudlets which came toward it from all quarters of the heavens and were swallowed up. A growing, whirling wall of pearly gray mounted and spread its shadow over half the earth. We threw out sand and mounted above it.

She could hear Mr. Hammerton's voice calling back to her father from the gate; they both laughed and then his quick tramp sounded on the planks. The tramp kept on and on for hours; the moon arose late; he walked out into the country, now tramping along the wayside and now in the road; it was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when he turned his face homeward and something past one when he silently unlocked the door with his night-key and found his way to his room. There was a letter there from Dinah; his sister had laid it on his bureau.

A little after two o'clock in the morning a sudden hush fell upon the whole gathering; we were all on our knees at the time.

Sprenger, in Germany, was the most celebrated of these national scourges. In his notorious work, the _Malleus Maleficarum_, he laid down a regular form of trial, and appointed a course of examination by which the inquisitors in other countries might best discover the guilty. The questions, which were always enforced by torture, were of the most absurd and disgusting nature. The inquisitors were required to ask the suspected whether they had <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> meetings with the devil? whether they attended the witches' sabbath on the Brocken? whether they had their familiar spirits? whether they could raise whirlwinds and call down the lightning? and whether they had had sexual intercourse with Satan?

Bill Bronson and Jack Jinks got onto it, and the small boys had to bribe the two bullies with some of the choicest of their stores. Nevertheless, the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> feast went off very smoothly. There were a few more cases for the medical attendant to see to at Rockledge School after Thanksgiving than usual. The midnight feast coming so soon after the big Thanksgiving dinner, played havoc in the ranks of the smaller boys.

He drew a silken noose from his saddle-bow, and threw it over the panting deer, who followed quietly on to his dwelling at Hapton Tower. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> there was heard a wild and unearthly shriek from the high turret, so pitiful and shrill that the inmates awoke in great alarm. The loud roar of the wind came on like a thunder-clap. The tempest flapped its wings, and its giant arms rocked the turret like a cradle. At this hour Lord William, with a wild and haggard eye, left his chamber. The last stroke of the midnight bell trembled on his ear as he entered the western tower.

Member for Bristol East was made by the writer at a Chamber of Commerce dinner to exercise his influence as a director of the Great Western Railway in the direction of obtaining the use of a goods train for the conveyance to Bristol of a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> mail from London. In the end the Railway Company afforded the Post Office the means of bringing down a midnight mail, not by goods train as was originally contemplated, but by new and fast passenger train, with the result that half a million letters a year now fall into the first delivery throughout the town, instead of into the second delivery as heretofore.

In his letter he assured the Czar, \"that whatever might be the vicissitudes of war, nothing could diminish the esteem entertained...", "...it.

The wife of a nobleman of the West of England, whose name is well-known in Cornwall, was supposed to be dead, and was buried in the family vault situated in the old parish church. A valuable ring which was on her finger when she died was allowed to remain, and it was known by the servants and villagers that this ornament was in the tomb with her. The sexton determined to get it, and accordingly at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> made his way to the church. In seeking to remove the ring he caused the latent life to assert itself, and seeing the lady move he ran out of the church, leaving the lantern behind him. She became conscious, took the sexton's lantern, and found her way back to the hall. She lived long enough to become the mother of a son, who afterwards became the heir of his father's estates.--_Note by the_ EDITOR.

The hundreds, which in the old time were deemed a respectable if not an extensive collection, would look insignificant beside the ostentatious array of modern libraries. But the very tenor of a monastic life compelled the monk to seek the sweet yet silent companionship of books; the rules of his order and the regulations of his fraternity enforced the strictest silence in the execution of his daily and never-ceasing duties. Attending mass, singing psalms, and <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> prayers, were succeeded by mass, psalms and prayers in one long undeviating round of yearly obligations; the hours intervening between these holy exercises were dull and tediously insupportable if unoccupied.

Then pausing suddenly upon the matting which covered the nave, his heart's pulsation seemed checked, for from the direction of the north door came all at once, loud and distinct in the empty church, a sharp metallic click; and then, at short intervals three more sounds each clear and sharp in the silence, as of money falling upon money. At any other time Jared would have ridiculed as absurd the idea of being alarmed by supernatural visitations: the church at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> was the same place to him, but for its darkness, as the church at midday; but now, broken, unnerved, and trembling in every limb, he stood by the south door as if fixed, listening eagerly. For a while there was silence, so that he could hear his own heart beat, and he tried to make out what all this could mean.

He is ashamed of this after he begins to know Clotilde, who is one of Jean Paul's pure and noble women; and he is at one time full of dread lest the Princess had read his watch-paper, and at another full of pique at the suspicion that she had not. Being court-physician and oculist, he has frequent opportunities to visit Agnola, and there is one rather florid occasion which the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> cry of the street-watch man interrupts. But all this time, the inflammable Victor was indulging a kind of tenderness for Joachime, maid-of-honor and attractive female. As the love for Clotilde deepens, he must destroy these partialities for Agnola and Joachime.

If the positive carbon is 18 mm. and the negative 12 mm., the consumption of each size of carbon is about 70 ft. per 1000 hours of burning. It may be roughly stated that at the present prices of plain open arc-lamp carbons the cost is about 15s. per 1000 hours of burning; hence if such a lamp is burnt every night from dusk to <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the annual cost in that respect is about L1, 10s. The annual cost of labour per lamp for trimming is in Great Britain from L2 to L3; hence, approximately speaking, the cost per annum of maintenance of a public arc lamp burning every night from dusk to midnight is about L4 to L5, or perhaps L6, per annum, depreciation and repairs included. Since such a 10 ampere lamp uses half a Board of Trade unit of electric energy every hour, it will take 1000 Board of Trade units per annum,...", "...restraint.

He had been, however, a week arriving at such a conclusion, and the sound of the cannonade was heard during the whole of the time occupied by our return. It was a pity to see a worthy potentate of moderate means spending his pocket-money so fruitlessly....", "...chair and passed through the doorway, chuckling to himself at the success of his little scheme to extricate himself. He was liberated now from the awkwardness of his false position. His day's rest and the attention he had received had done wonders towards effecting his recovery, and ordering a horse to be saddled, a few minutes later he passed out of the precincts of the Hall, and hoping that he would never have occasion to return, he mustered up his strength and started out upon a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> ride to Ashby.

But in these cases We still have judgment that we but teach Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return To plague th' inventor; this evil-handed justice Commends th' ingredients of our poisoned chalice To our own lips.

The whole affair intrigued him and interested him. He plunged in with a will and gave them all the help he could. He had no time to be bored, and he did not mark the passage of time until he arrived at his thirteenth birthday. Then one night shortly after his birthday, James Holden discovered women indirectly. He had his first erotic dream. We shall not go into the details of this <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> introduction to the arrival of manhood, for the simple reason that if we dwell on the subject, someone is certain to attempt a dream-analysis and come up with some flanged-up character-study or personality-quirk that really has nothing to do with the mind or body of James Holden. The truth is that his erotic dream was pleasantly stirring, but not entirely satisfactory. It was fun while it lasted, but it didn't last very long. It awakened him to the realization that knowledge...", "...and helplessness, the child fell on her knees and repeated an Ave Maria; the clouds drifted away, and the low moon shone out between the trees with a pale glow, that to our convent-taught Madelon seemed suddenly to irradiate and transfigure the night with a glory not of earth. Never in after years did she, in church or picture-gallery, come across glorified Madonna, or saint floating in ethereal spaces, without the memory returning to her of a silent road, dark, rustling trees, a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sky swept with clouds; and then a vision, as it were, of light and hope, giving new strength and courage to one little terrified heart. Madelon started on her journey with renewed energy, but she hardly knew how she got through the miles that remained. The moon rose higher and higher, the road bordered with poplar- trees seemed to stretch before and behind into a never-ending length, as in some wearying nightmare. Madelon, in her straight, old-fashioned silk frock, her...", "...Mullins too long and that he had detained him too long already and that Mullins must be weary from his train journey and that in cases of extreme weariness nothing but a sound sleep was of any avail; he himself, unfortunately, would not be able to avail himself of the priceless boon of slumber until he had first retired to his study to write some letters; so that Mullins, who had a certain kind of social quickness of intuition, saw that it was time to leave, and went away. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> as he went down the street, and a dark, still night. That can be stated positively because it came out in court afterwards. Mullins swore that it was a dark night; he admitted, under examination, that there may have been the stars, or at least some of the less important of them, though he had made no attempt, as brought out on cross-examination, to count them: there may have been, too, the electric lights, and Mullins was not willing to deny that it was quite possible that...", "...grove, up the river several miles. Lunch baskets were taken along, but no chaperons. The girls were all dressed in cambric and muslin and as light in heart as the fabrics and ribbons they flaunted. I was gratified with the boldness of Cotton, as he cantered away with Frances, and with the day before him there was every reason to believe that his cause would he advanced. As to myself, with Esther by my side the livelong day, I could not have asked the world to widen an inch. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when we reached Las Palomas returning. As we rode along that night, John confessed to me that Frances was a tantalizing enigma. Up to a certain point, she offered every encouragement, but beyond that there seemed to be a dead line over which she allowed no sentiment to pass. It was plain to be seen that he was discouraged, but I told him I had gone through worse ordeals. Throughout southern Texas and the country tributary to the Nueces River, we always looked for our...", "...sort of odd--but I wanted to fight for you!\" She came a little closer. \"Some day, perhaps,\" she spoke with sudden gravity, \"I may ask you to do that.\" \"What? Fight for you?\" Bertha nodded. * * * * * It was after the Olympia had been made over into a larger Tivoli Opera House that Frank met Aleta Boice. She was a member of the chorus. Their acquaintance blossomed from propinquity, for both had a fashion of supping on the edge of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> at a little restaurant, better known by its sobriquet of \"Dusty Doughnut,\" than by its real name, which long ago had been forgotten. Frank had formed the habit of sitting at a small table somewhat isolated from the others where now and then he wrote an article or editorial. Hitherto it had unvaryingly been at his disposal, for the hour of Frank's reflection was not a busy one. Therefore he was just a mite annoyed to find his table tenanted by a woman. Perhaps his irritation...", "...Laura had been watching by the bedside; Clay had arrived, preceding Washington by one day, and he was now added to the corps of watchers. Mr. Hawkins would have none but these three, though neighborly assistance was offered by old friends. From this time forth three-hour watches were instituted, and day and night the watchers kept their vigils. By degrees Laura and her mother began to show wear, but neither of them would yield a minute of their tasks to Clay. He ventured once to let the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hour pass without calling Laura, but he ventured no more; there was that about her rebuke when he tried to explain, that taught him that to let her sleep when she might be ministering to her father's needs, was to rob her of moments that were priceless in her eyes; he perceived that she regarded it as a privilege to watch, not a burden. And, he had noticed, also, that when midnight struck, the patient turned his eyes toward the door, with an expectancy in them which presently...", "...are lovely,--all silver lace and cocked hats! Oh, Philip, do wear one of those! And I'll write to Nan, to get me a costume. What are you going to wear, Mona?\" \"But we mustn't tell!\" said Adele, in dismay. \"This is a masquerade, not merely a fancy dress ball.\" \"Oh!\" said Patty. \"Then we'll have to change our plans, Philip. The Sleeping Beauty game is all off!\" \"Only for the moment!\" And Philip threw her a challenging glance. CHAPTER XIV A PROPOSAL It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when the Christmas guests went away, and Patty declared her intention of going to bed at once. \"I coasted and danced and played hide and seek till I'm utterly worn out,\" she said, \"and I think I shall sleep for a week!\" \"But I'm going away to-morrow,\" said Philip, detaining her a moment. \"But you're coming back next week. I'll promise to be awake by then. But now I'm going to hibernate, like a bear! Good-night, everybody!\" and Patty ran upstairs without further...", "...their preparations for the contemplated exodus. Early dawn and the latest twilight saw them hurrying to and fro gathering together provisions, cattle, carriages, wagons, seeds, farming implements--everything that was likely to be of service to them in the new homes they were going to make somewhere in the wilderness. Nor did their labors end with the light of day. Often it happened that the dingy smithies were illuminated through the night by the blazing forge, and the stillness of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> was broken by the merry ring of anvils, while others sat in council devising the best methods of traveling and organizing into companies those whose arrangements were nearing completion. Meantime the temple had been so far completed that endowments could be given to the faithful; and in this work Elder Taylor with others of his quorum was employed during that eventful winter. He also continued to publish the _Times and Seasons_ up to the time of his departure for the...", "...is a religious poet indeed, a visionary, a mystic, and a Christian; none of which names can be truly applied to Milton. And if we wish to find Love enjoying his just supremacy in poetry, we cannot do better than seek him among the lyrists of the Court of Charles II. Milton, self-sufficient and censorious, denies the name of love to these songs of the sons of Belial. Love, he says, reigns and revels in Eden, not in court amours, Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> ball, Or serenate, which the starved lover sings To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. Yet for the quick and fresh spirit of love in the poetry of that time we must go to the sons of Belial. There is a pathetic passage in one of Milton's divorce pamphlets, where, speaking of the unhappy choices in marriage to which \"soberest and best governed men\" are liable, he remarks:--\"It is not strange though many, who have spent their youth chastely, are in some things not...", "...landing place. It was the very spot where the red-caps had landed. Years had changed the more perishable features of the scene; but rock and iron yield slowly to the influence of time. On looking more closely Wolfert remarked three crosses cut in the rock just above the ring, which had no doubt some mysterious signification. Old Sam now readily recognized the overhanging rock under which his skiff had been sheltered during the thunder gust. To follow up the course which the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> gang had taken, however, was a harder task. His mind had been so much taken up on that eventful occasion by the persons of the drama as to pay but little attention to the scenes, and these places looked so different by night and day. After wandering about for some time, however, they came to an opening among the trees which Sam thought resembled the place. There was a ledge of rock of moderate height, like a wall, on one side, which he thought might be the very ridge whence...", "...thy Kingdom.\" Jesus straightened up and held out his arms to all the people. \"Come to me, all of you who labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest!\" The disciples felt the power of their Master as they heard him call on the people to repent. They had never known anyone like him; they had never heard a message like his. Again and again they heard Jesus say: \"Do you understand why you have been healed? This is a sign that the power of God has come among you.\" It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> when the last person left. Jesus was very tired. He looked at the black sky. There was no moon. The stars shed a faint light on the hills above Capernaum. Jesus turned to Simon. \"It is time to rest.\" He went into the house. \"The people had no fear of evil night spirits,\" remarked James. \"They know he has power over them,\" commented Simon. In the morning, long before dawn, Jesus rose in order to pray outside the city. A few yards from Simon's home the street dwindled to a...", "...ended, and if John was hurt. _4 p. m._ On board the steamer St. Charles. We expect to make Donaldsonville by eight to-night. The sail down the river is glorious. Whatever comes when we reach our destination, we are having a regular picnic now. Going with the current, the boat cuts the water like a knife. There is too much to look at and to enjoy for me to waste the time writing, so good-bye till to-morrow. _July 16, 1863._ DONALDSONVILLE, LA. _Thursday._ We landed here about <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> last night. A heavy shower overtook us on the way and wet us to the skin, consequently what sleep we had was on wet ground and in wet clothes. This has been a very pretty place. The levee hides it from view from the river, but the place and the country around it is beautiful. It has been fortified, and when the gunboats fought their way up the river a year ago they were obliged to mar its beauty somewhat. There is a sugar mill near by with lots of sugar and molasses in it.

Eh--do I see a light?\" He did. A light lurid sulphurous gleam upon the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> of his mind seemed to show the way before him, as wisp-fire in a marsh. He did see a light, and its character was this: Quite aware of his mother's tranquil hopefulness, and that his kind good sister was ingenuous as the day, he soon apprehended the state of affairs; and, resolving to increase those misunderstandings on all sides, he quickly perceived that he could triumph in the keen Machiavellian policy, \"_divide et impera_.\" The plan became more obvious as he calmly...", "...him. We had quite a talk. And that afternoon I gave up our flat.\" \"Why?\" asked Eleanore softly. \"I presumed the landlord wished it,\" said Mrs. Marsh without looking around. \"I took a room in a cheap hotel. Mr. Marsh came out of jail with ideas that were all new to me. He had left his old trade union and gone in with a new crowd of men who stood for out-and-out revolution--which I couldn't understand. But we made the best of it. We went to the theater that night and then he took the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> train on one of his first labor trips. At first these trips were only for a week or so, but as time went on they grew longer. As a rule I never wrote him because I never knew his address. On one trip he was away five weeks--and before he got back there was time enough for my second baby, a little boy, to be born and die of pneumonia.\" Eleanore flinched as though that had hurt. I saw her turn and look at Sue, who seemed even more restless than before. \"You decided to...", "...found him in the garden with a lady, and I walked away. . .

Then, after resting a little, she took her brother's hand and went on in a weak, toneless voice: \"How kind you are, Alyosha! . . . And how clever! . . .

They were all talking softly in undertones, and had not noticed that the lamp was smoking and would soon go out. All these people, big and little, were disturbed by a whole...", "...the \"La M'sieu's!\" which trickled through the hay. I am sure that one such little episode saved me. For I heard a soldier just above me poking and tossing hay with uncomfortable vigour. But presently the amorous hunter turned his thoughts elsewhere, and I was left to myself, and to a late breakfast of parched beans and bread and raw eggs, after which I lay and thought; and the sum of the thinking was that I would stay where I was till the first wave of the hunt had passed. Near <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> of the second day I came out secretly from my lurking-place, and faced straight for the St. Charles River. Finding it at high water, I plunged in, with my knapsack and cloak on my head, and made my way across, reaching the opposite shore safely. After going two miles or so, I discovered friendly covert in the woods, where, in spite of my cloak and dry cedar boughs wrapped round, I shivered as I lay until the morning. When the sun came up, I drew out, that it might dry me;...", "...took up a supporting position in the neighborhood of Peissant.

The next night the same thing took place, and the third night, too. Then she told the moujik about it. He called his kinsfolk together, and held counsel with them.

So at eventide they all lay down on the floor, and beside them they set a lighted taper hidden in an earthen pot. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the cottage door opened. Some one stepped up to the cradle. The babe became still. At that moment one of the kinsfolk suddenly brought out the light. They looked, and saw the dead mother, in the very same clothes in which she had been buried, on her knees besides the cradle, over which she bent as she suckled the babe at her dead breast.

Through the whole of the autumn and early winter, he had urged the States of Holland and Zeeland to make use of the long winter nights, when moonless and stormy, to attempt the destruction of Parma's undertaking, but the fatal influences already indicated were more efficient against Antwerp than even the genius of Farnese; and nothing came of the burgomaster's entreaties save desultory skirmishing and unsuccessful enterprises. An especial misfortune happened in one of these <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> undertakings. Teligny ventured forth in a row-barge, with scarcely any companions, to notify the Zeelanders of a contemplated movement, in which their co- operation was desired. It was proposed that the Antwerp troops should make a fictitious demonstration upon Fort Ordam, while at the same moment the States' troops from Fort Lillo should make an assault upon the forts on Kowenstyn Dyke; and in this important enterprise the Zeeland vessels were requested to assist. But the...", "...before he shows us to our staterooms?\" \"Not at all, miss,\" said the skipper, \"he's at your service. I can do without him--easy.\" Stump was angry with Dick, and did not hesitate to show it. A blunt man, of plain speech, he resented anything in the nature of double-dealing. Royson's remarkable proficiency in most matters bearing on the navigation of a ship had amazed him in the first instance, and this juggling with names led him to suspect some deep-laid villainy with which the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> attack on von Kerber was not wholly unconnected. But the person most taken aback by Irene's self-assertion was Mrs. Haxton. A firm attitude on the girl's part came as an unpleasing novelty. An imperious light leaped to her eyes, but she checked the words which might have changed a trivial incident into a sharp tussle for supremacy. \"I am sorry,\" she said quietly. \"Telegrams are important things, sometimes.

For perfection in this toothsome dish, mustard is demanded by some; by others the use of this biting condiment is considered a lapse in culinary taste. The consensus of opinion, however, is in favor of paprica; and, theoretically, Mattieu Williams considers bicarbonate of soda to be demanded, not for the sake of seasoning, but as an aid to digestion. As regards the digestibility of cheese, and, consequently, its adaptability to <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> suppers, opinions differ widely. Dr. Hoy, an excellent authority on diet, calls cheese a concentrated meat, a tissue builder,--but not itself a tissue, and so without waste elements,--a condensed, compact food product, and indigestible on account of its very compactness. Still, when the caseine, or curd, is softened and broken up by the addition of liquid and gentle heat, it is rendered more digestible; and cheese so prepared may be for some, if taken with no other nitrogenous...", "...the initiate fear that wants hard use; We are yet but young in deed.

The stippled line shows how I assume the ice to have lain; the heavy broken line shows what our course ought to have been. The <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> sun was not seen till the night of January 7, 1912, to the south of lat. 77 deg. S.; it was already 9.5 deg. above the horizon. On the night of January 8 we arrived off the Barrier in extremely bitter weather. South-westerly and southerly winds had held for a few days, with fair weather; but that night there was thick snow, and the wind gradually fell calm, after which a fresh breeze sprang up from the south-east, with biting snow, and at the same time a lot of drift-ice....", "...of which were strongly held by the enemy. Just beyond this quadrangle, however, one or two kopjes projected from its western face. French determined to seize one of these, from which he could push forward along the enemy's flank, jeopardising his line of retreat. As usual, the venture was brilliantly conceived and ably carried out. During the day a squadron of Hussars was sent forward to Maeder's Farm, some five miles on the line of march. There the men bivouacked under arms, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> set out on a silent march to the west. Under the screen of darkness and perfect silence the advance was speedy. Even the regimental carts were dispensed with, lest the creaking of their wheels might betray the advance. Not until the column was near its objective, McCracken's Hill, did the Boers suspect its approach. An amazed shouting and some wild rifle-fire from the outposts--and McCracken's Hill was in French's hands. The cavalry now wound round the hill towards the road....", "...by fervid speeches from the women, whose shrill voices were carried out into the night air as a warning to the enemy that they would not lag behind their lords in the coming battle. Meantime, Te Rauparaha lay waiting for the enemy, who never came. Either having no stomach for another encounter with so redoubtable a warrior, or still not understanding the true position, they wisely declined to provoke a battle, about the result of which they could be by no means sanguine. At <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> the tide turned, and the river fell sufficiently to be fordable.[53] Leaving their fires burning, the Ngati-Toa crept silently down to the bank, and, wading across, made their way to the _pas_ of their friends, which they reached amidst general rejoicing. Early next morning the scene of the previous day's battle was revisited and the bodies of the slain enemy recovered to make a feast, at which the sweet revenge harboured against Ngati-Mania-poto was surfeited. While the...", "...that the Cavaliere no longer spoke of the Church with that hardness, which had hurt me so often. It is true that the Padre was with us nearly all the time; but not only was Valguanera courteous, he was almost sympathetic; and I wondered if it might not prove that more than one soul benefited by the untoward events of the day. With the aid of the astonished and delighted servants, and no little help as well from Signora Valguanera, I fitted up the long cold Altar in the chapel, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> we had the gloomy sanctuary beautiful with flowers and candles. It was a curiously solemn service, in the first hour of the new day, in the midst of blazing candles and the thick incense, the odour of the opening orange-blooms drifting up in the fresh morning air, and mingling with the incense smoke and the perfume of flowers within. Many prayers were said that night for the soul of the dead girl, and I think many afterward; for after the benediction I remained for a little...", "...passages that would afford exits and entrances not apparent to the eye. It would be an easy matter to run into the city, explain myself to my assistant, and get hold of Pepperton. My mind was made up, and I had even consulted a time-table and chosen one of the express trains. As I sat at the table absorbed in my plans for the day, my nerves received a sudden shock. I had heard no one enter, yet a voice at my shoulder murmured casually: \"Hast thou seen ghosts? Hast thou at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> heard\"-- It was the voice of Hezekiah, I knew, before I faced her. She wore a blue sailor-waist with a broad red ribbon tied under the collar, and a blue tam o' shanter capped her head. She bore a tray that contained my omelet, a plate of toast, and other sundries incidental to a substantial breakfast, which she distributed deftly upon the table. \"How did you get here?\" I blurted, my nerves still out of control. \"The kitchen door, sir. I had ridden into the garden,...", "...a terrific gale of wind and a thunderstorm. We had to put in close to the land, and for four hours sit it out in a deluge of rain. It was soon inky dark, the lightning very vivid, and the thunder deafening. Piri's boat anchored close alongside. On the weather clearing up a little, we crossed Hall Sound to Delena, where we were soon met by natives carrying torches, and were led to their houses. A change of clothing, and we were all as comfortable as possible. We spent the hour of <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> with Kone and Levas, chiefs of Delena, telling them of our visit to the west, and its success in establishing peace. They were greatly delighted, and will do me the honour of visiting me at Port Moresby, that is, will relieve me of some tomahawks. With a light wind and a smooth sea, we had a pleasant run to Boera, where we arrived at sunset. There was great joy in the village at our arrival. We reached Port Moresby on the 20th, and on March 6th we baptized Kohu and Rahela,...", "...in the public street. Towards evening, awnings were run out from the hotel, from beneath which rose the sound of lively voices discussing native politics, and the clinking of glasses and teaspoons. Here, the upper class of Corte regaled themselves with tobacco, chat, and refreshment, to a late hour; whilst their well-dressed but poorer compatriots were content to wander up and down in front, in groups of threes and fours, pipe in mouth, with grave step and conversation. Until past <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> this incessant pacing up and down the centre of the road, and the quiet hum of voices, continued through the hot, streaming, night-air. Two things struck me, both on the Saturday and Sunday night: the first was the absence of drunken shouts, and the second the absence of female voices. Drunkards are undoubtedly to be found in Corsica, but apparently, a sense of the national dignity of demeanour remains even to them, and they do not shout and rave and misbehave like a Briton...", "...and there was good cause for it. She was slightly in advance, and was rounding another of the turns of the stream, when she caught sight of a huge black bear, who, instead of staying in some hollow tree or cave, sucking his paw the winter through, was lumbering over the ice in the same direction with themselves. He was near the middle of the frozen current, so that it was prudent for them to turn to the right or left, and was proceeding at an easy pace, as if he was out for a <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> stroll, while he thought over matters. Though one of the stupidest of animals, he was quick to hear the noise behind him and looked back to learn what it meant. CHAPTER II. A WARNING FROM THE WOODS. Monteith Sterry began drawing the mitten from his right hand with the intention of using his revolver on the bear, when he checked himself with the thought: \"Better to wait until I need it; the most of this excursion is still before us.\" The lumbering brute...", "...sounds; a few tree-frogs piped, two or three solitary wayfarers passed in the street; twice or more the sergeant of the night-watch trilled his whistle in a street or two behind us, and twice or more in front; and once, and once again, came the distant bellow of steamboats passing each other--not the famous boats whose whistle you would know one from another, for they were laid up. I doubt if I have forgotten any sound that I noticed that night. I remember the drowsy rumble of the <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> horse-car and tinkle of its mule's bell, first in Prytania street and then in Magazine. It was just after these that at last a black hand beckoned me to the door, and under her breath the old nurse told me she was just back from our house, where her mistress had sent her, and that--\"De-eh--de-eh\"-- \"The Baroness?\" \"Yass, sih, de--de outlayndish la-ady--\" Senda had sent word that the child had only an indigestion--a thing serious enough in such a case--and though still...", "...and he told me again the wonderful story, and showed me the pencil sketch which he had made of John Balmuto in Donald Brae's cottage. He had painted from it a grand picture of his deliverer, wearing the long black camlet cloak and head-kerchief of the order of evangelists to which he belonged. I stood reverently before the commanding figure, with its inspired eyes and rapt expression; for, during those thirty years, I also had learned that it was only those Who ne'er the mournful <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> hours Weeping upon their bed have sate, Who know you not, Ye Heavenly Powers.

In a letter to a friend she said: \"The other day a millionaire who wrote me, 'wondered why I didn't have my letters typewritten.' Why, bless him, I never, in all my fifty years of hard work with the pen, had a writing desk with pigeonholes and drawers until my seventieth birthday brought me the present of one, and never had I even a dream of money enough for a stenographer and typewriter.

How that may be, I will not say; but this much is certain: that on these stormy nights he picks out the finest trees in the Tannenbuehl, where none dare to chop, and my father once saw him break off a tree four feet thick as easily as if it had been a reed. He makes a present of these trees to those who will turn from the right and follow him; then at <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> they bring down these logs to the river, and he goes with his followers down to Holland. But if I were the King of Holland, I would have him blown to pieces with grape-shot; for every ship that has in it any of Dutch Michel's timber, even if it be only a single stick, must go to the bottom. This is the cause of all the shipwrecks we hear of; for how else could a fine strong ship, as large as a church, be destroyed on the water? And whenever Dutch Michel fells a pine in the...", "...my disappearance, he asked me if I knew a little story by the Abbe Chiari, which had come out at the end of the carnival. As I said that I knew nothing about it, he gave me a copy, telling me that I should like it. He was right. It was a satire in which the Zorzi clique was pulled to pieces, and in which I played a very poor part. I did not read it till some time after, and in the mean time put it in my pocket. After a very good supper I took a gondola to return to Muran. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">midnight</span> and very dark, so that I did not perceive the gondola to be ill covered and in wretched order. A fine rain was falling when I got in, and the drops getting larger I was soon wet to the skin. No great harm was done, as I was close to my quarters. I groped my way upstairs and knocked at the door of the ante-room, where Tonine, who had not waited for me, was sleeping. Awake in a moment she came to open the door in her smock, and without a light.

She confessed with such amiable candour her taste for good cheer and the comforts of life, that it would have been necessary to be as severe in principle as insensible to the excellent qualities of the Princess, to consider it a crime in her.
