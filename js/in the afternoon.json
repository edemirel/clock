From this point, after a start for Centreville and countermarch, he moved down the Sudley road to the pike, which the head of his column reached at dark. But he still held on to his train. Reynolds, although greatly impeded by Sigel's troops and wagons, forced his way past them, passed Gainesville, and moved down the pike towards Groveton, in order to gain his required position upon Sigel's left. Approaching Groveton about ten...", "...and had a cup of tea with him. He was a very kindly-mannered man and we took a liking to him. One of his officers, Lieutenant Barry, was to remain with my regiment and initiate us into the mysteries of the flame-lit trenches in front of Fromelles. The regiment paraded on the morning of the 2nd and General Congrieve and Colonel Levison-Gower were on hand to bid us good-bye. It was a very pleasant march. The day was fine and cool and the men in splendid spirits. We reached Bac St. Maur <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and went into billets for the night. I was quartered at the Mayor's house. We now began to realize that in Flanders every cross road means a town or village. The men were quartered in a flax weaving mill. Every town in this country boasts a flax mill with numerous weaving and bleaching plants. Many of the factories before the war were owned by Germans. As the German-owned factories are never shelled they make splendid billets for the troops. We spent one night in...", "...and yet remain to trample masterfully on that earth when he was gone? He thought of some distant relations, and felt savage enough to curse them aloud. They! Never! He turned homewards, going straight at the roof of his dwelling, visible between the enlaced skeletons of trees. As he swung his legs over the stile a cawing flock of birds settled slowly on the field; dropped down behind his back, noiseless and fluttering, like flakes of soot. That day Madame Levaille had gone early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to the house she had near Kervanion. She had to pay some of the men who worked in her granite quarry there, and she went in good time because her little house contained a shop where the workmen could spend their wages without the trouble of going to town. The house stood alone amongst rocks. A lane of mud and stones ended at the door. The sea-winds coming ashore on Stonecutter's point, fresh from the fierce turmoil of the waves, howled violently at the unmoved heaps of...", "...and the two Indians in the labour of cutting a road. The ground continued rising gently till noon, when it began to decline; but though on such an elevated situation, we could see but little, as mountains of a still higher elevation, and covered with snow, were seen far above us in every direction. In the afternoon the ground became very uneven; hills and deep defiles alternately presented themselves to us. Our progress, however, exceeded my expectation, and it was not till four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that the carriers overtook us. At five, in a state of fatigue that may be more readily conceived than expressed, we encamped near a rivulet or spring that issued from beneath a large mass of ice and snow. Our toilsome journey of this day I compute at about three miles; along the first of which the land is covered with plenty of wood, consisting of large trees, encumbered with little underwood, through which it was by no means difficult to open a road, by following a...", "...easily undone by carelessness on the part of either hydroairplane or destroyer commanders. Two hours after the attack began Darrin received signalled orders to return to his former position in the escort line. \"Thus endeth the second chapter--apparently,\" commented Danny Grin. During this engagement, as on the day before, the soldiers who crowded the destroyer had been ordered from the decks during the fight. They were now notified that they might come out. It was one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the leading hydroairplane signalled a report that the sea ahead was strewn with wreckage. Ship after ship sailed through this mute evidence of the enemy's presence and detestable work. Spars with clinging cordage floated by. Wooden hatchcovers, overturned boats, oars, chairs, wooden boxes, bales of soaked cotton and what-not were in the litter that strewed the sea over a broad area. One of the overturned lifeboats was overhauled.

Whistler and his officers, as true soldiers, were prompt to appreciate bravery. They were broad enough to judge these savages by the standards of savagery, not by those of a civilization from which the Indian is removed by centuries of human progress. They knew full well that the culprits were but carrying out the law of their race in seeking white scalps in vengeance for the Winnebagoes supposed to have been slain...", "...cutting the bridge. Both Wolfe and Montcalm were mortally wounded after the issue of the day was really decided, and both survived to be certain, the one of victory, the other of defeat. Wolfe died on the field of battle. Montcalm was taken into a house in Quebec and died early the next morning. It is perhaps the only incident in history of a decisive battle of world import followed by the death of both leaders, each made immortal by the tragedy of their common fate. At two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day of defeat, Vaudreuil held a tumultuous council of war. It was decided to abandon Quebec, where Montcalm lay dying and to retreat up the St. Lawrence to Montreal, to the defense of which Levis had been sent before the fight. That night the whole French army fled in panic, leaving their tents standing and abandoning quantities of stores. Vaudreuil who had talked so bravely about death in the ruins of Canada, rather than surrender, gave orders to Ramezay,...", "...each other there. The caravan consisted of about thirty laden mules, a couple of horsemen, mollahs, pilgrims returning from Meshed, merchants, mechanics and my insignificant self. It was two hours after midnight when we started, and proceeded along the wide path leading to Shah Abdul-Azim, a place which is held in high esteem by the Teheran people as a resort for pilgrims. I walked there frequently during my stay in Teheran. The place is full of life and noise during the day, especially <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> hours. There can be seen at all times a troop of gaudily dressed women of the better classes, sitting on horseback man fashion, prominent mirzahs and khans with numerous followers, and now and then a European coach, used generally by the court only. Of course at the time of night that we passed through it a dead silence was brooding over it. The moon shed an almost day-like light upon the mountain range stretching to the left and upon the gilded cupola beneath which...", "...under the necessity of going out through the pavilion of Flora. M. de Gouvion and M. de La Fayette would, of course, be apprised of this circumstance, and well-informed persons have assured me that on the very night of the Queen's departure this wretched woman had a spy with her, who saw the royal family set off. As soon as I had executed all the Queen's orders, on the 30th of May, 1791, I set out for Auvergne, and was settled in the gloomy narrow valley of Mont d'Or, when, about four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 25th of June, I heard the beat of a drum to call the inhabitants of the hamlet together. When it had ceased I heard a hairdresser from Bresse proclaim in the provincial dialect of Auvergne: \"The King and Queen were taking flight in order to ruin France, but I come to tell you that they are stopped, and are well guarded by a hundred thousand men under arms.\" I still ventured to hope that he was repeating only a false report, but he went on: \"The Queen,\" with her...", "...as marked by the pointer of the balance.

It may, perhaps, be worth while to add, for the purpose of anticipating some critical remarks which are likely to be made, that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I called for Mr. Home at his apartments, and when there he suggested that, as he had to change his dress, perhaps I should not object to continue our conversation in his bedroom. I am, therefore, enabled to state positively, that no machinery, apparatus, or contrivance of any sort was secreted about his person. The investigators present on the test occasion were an eminent physicist, high in the ranks of the Royal Society,[64] a...", "...and regarded himself with curiosity. Once he smiled, as if by way of practice, and then a sudden sense of shame seemed to come over him, for he reddened and turned away. Most people will be able to guess what ailed him, but he himself did not know at the time. The week went away but slowly. On the Wednesday evening the old Squire said: \"You'll go over to Branspath to-morrow morning early. Richards will drive you in, and you must call on Chernside and tell him I wish to see him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> about Gibson's lease. He'll know what you mean.\" The young man shifted uneasily. \"Couldn't you send a note by Richards?\" He felt his face hot as he asked the question. \"Well, yes, I could, if I chose, but I want Richards to order a few things in the High Street. He'll pick you up when you've done with Chernside.\" At two o'clock next day young Mr. Ellington was back again at the Hall. As he stepped down from the dog-cart, Richards pointed to the horse. \"I doubt we've...", "...monotony of the day! \"And I shall be pleased to look after the little ones, madame,\" said he, politely, \"if you are going over.\" Madame thanked him very profusely; but assured him that so long as the weather looked so stormy she could not think of intrusting Josephine and Veronique to the mercy of the waves. Now, if George Brand had little hope of meeting his friends that day, he acted pretty much as if he were expecting some one. First of all, he had secured a saloon-carriage <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> mail-train to London--an unnecessary luxury for a bachelor well accustomed to the hardships of travel. Then he had managed to procure a handsome bouquet of freshly-cut flowers. Finally, there was some mysterious arrangement by which fruit, cakes, tea, and wine were to be ready at a moment's notice in the event of that saloon-carriage being required. Then, as soon as the rumor went through the hotel that the vessel was in sight, away he went down the pier, with his...", "...to the stage; then commenced a slow and measured tread, every movement being graceful. Cherry blossoms were everywhere, even forming the decorations on the wall. Different figures were repeated, but all in that deliberate manner, very little like dancing but more like a devotional exercise. We sat there for about an hour, but cannot truthfully say that we enjoyed the music, as it was somewhat discordant. Our last day in Kyoto was a very full one. We visited shops in the morning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> went quite a distance to see a historical procession. We were seated in about the same manner as previously described. Those who took part in the procession were geisha girls and novitiates who were to be educated as future geisha girls, their parents giving them over to the instructors at an early age. This was a very interesting pageant. First only one or two would appear in a historical costume of very rich brocade, the hair most elaborately dressed with the...", "...where the natives had encamped the previous night. This surprised us, because we were not aware that there were any so immediately in our vicinity. It however shewed us the necessity of vigilance and circumspection in our future movements. Steering for the most western point of Mount Deception range, until we opened one still more distant to the north-west, and which I named Termination Hill, we kept pushing on through barren stony plains, without grass or shrubs, and arrived late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> upon a large watercourse with gum-trees, but could find no water in its bed. Near it, however, in the plains, we were fortunate enough to discover a puddle of rain water, and at once halted for the night, though the feed was indifferent. We had travelled twenty-eight miles, and the pack-horse carrying twelve gallons of water, was considerably fatigued. At the puddle, two teal were seen, which indicated the existence of a larger body of water somewhere in the...", "...little dots of white down, except for a long wavy band of red down which ran all along both sides of the mound. This wavy red band represented the Wollunqua, his head being indicated by a small round swelling at one end and his tail by a short prolongation at the other. The mound itself represented a sand-hill beside which the snake is said to have stood up and looked about. The preparation of this elaborate emblem of the Wollunqua occupied the greater part of the day, and it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before it was completed. When darkness fell, fires were lighted on the ceremonial ground, and as the night grew late more fires were kindled, and all of the men sat round the mound singing songs which referred to the mythical water-snake. This went on for hours. At last, about three o'clock in the morning, a ring of fires was lit all round the ceremonial ground, in the light of which the white trunks of the gum-trees and the surrounding scrub stood out weird and...", "...fully verified by a recent letter from a pioneer woman who was a member of that church and was also a witness to the event at the schoolhouse. The sixty dollars may have been tainted money (if it is possible to taint a well-inspired benefaction), but the act sheds a soft ray of light upon the life of a man whose career and character were generally regarded as dark. On the following day, after passing the grave by the two trees, we drove thirteen miles. As we were slowly moving along <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> over the heavy sands and up a long but rather gentle slope, we suddenly observed two wagons with mule teams approaching from the west, the animals being driven at the top of their speed under the lash of the drivers. On discovering us, the drivers motioned in an agitated manner toward Fred and me who were riding on horseback, indicating that they wished us to halt. We accordingly stopped the train and awaited their arrival. They at once reported a large band of Indians...", "...which it was the victim, and convinced even its bitterest enemies that it was not lacking in spirit and in courage in the very jaws of death. All the historians who have attempted a description of the prison life of that time unite in declaring that contempt of death was never evinced more forcibly than by the victims of that bloody epoch. The ladies displayed habits of luxury that were worthy of the days of the Regency. In the morning they generally appeared in bewitching negliges; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they made more careful and elegant toilettes, and when evening came they donned the costly, trailing robes which they had worn at Court, only a few short weeks before.

Hence, the prison resembled a...", "...are those attributed to one or two of the older European diplomatists, who lament being sent on an errand which they fear is to be fruitless. One of these is said to have bewailed this mission as a sad ending to his public services, and to have declared that as he had led a long life of devotion to his country and to its sovereign, his family might well look upon his career as honorable; but that now he is probably doomed to crown it with an open failure.

This seemed remarkable, as the tidal current ran swift as a river here. On the west side of the island there lay in front of the glacier a rampart of ice and snow, which was probably formed of pieces of glacier-ice and sea-ice welded together. It had the same character as the massive shore-ice which we had seen previously running along the land. This rampart went over imperceptibly with an even slope into the glacier within it. \"About three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we finally set off in open water and sailed till eight or so in the evening; the water was then closed, and we were compelled to haul the fleet over flat ice to open water on the other side.

One Sunday morning, the faithful worshippers, going to matins at the Church of St. Germain-des-Pres, found the square occupied by a troop of Bedouins, wrapt in their burnouses, and sleeping the sleep of the just. Some had squatted in corners, calmly smoking their _chibouks_. This was in the days of the Algerian campaign, and the rumour spread like wildfire that a party of Arab prisoners of war were bivouacked round the church, where a special service would be given <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> as the first step to their conversion to Christianity. It being Sunday, the whole of Paris rushed to the spot. The Bedouins had, however, disappeared, but a collection was made in their behalf by several demure-looking young men. The Parisians gave liberally. That night, and two or three nights after, the nocturnal pests' occupation was gone, for the \"Childebert\" was lighted _a giorno_ from basement to roof, and the Childebertians held high festival.

She opened the little wooden door. The cabinet-maker caught sight at once of the desk. It had only three legs and was just about ready to fall to pieces. \"I can't make you an offer for that,\" said the cabinet-maker, and began to rap on it here and there, somewhat as a physician might sound a corpse. \"The most I can offer you is twelve groschen.\" They haggled for a while, and finally agreed on sixteen.

In the dust of one of the drawers she found, sure enough, a bundle of papers, and among them the receipt which Gottfried Nothafft had sent back to Jason Philip ten years before. She read in the indistinct light the...", "...want to. You see the wind is on shore, and they are all riding head to it. There can't be much water inside them. No doubt they could get out all right if they had plenty of time and no one to interfere with them, but it would be a difficult business to manage if the British fleet were upon them.\" At ten o'clock the next morning a number of large vessels were seen in the distance. They bore down towards Alexandria, but the wind was light and they made but slow way, and it was five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before, having changed their course, they formed into line of battle and headed for the French fleet. The scene from the shore was intensely exciting. In each fleet there were thirteen battle-ships, but the French ships were the larger and more heavily armed. They carried forty-six more guns, and the weight of their broadside was 14,029 pounds to 10,695 pounds, while they carried 2300 more men, and were 5000 tons heavier.

In the summer of 1902 the result proved disastrous to a too inquisitive tourist. He was traveling with his...", "...and so he came over and sat and drank with us, and at his request I went over with him, and there I sat till the evening, and till both Mr. Knightly and Mr. Faulconberge (for whom I sent my boy to get a coach to carry him to Westminster) were both drunk, and so home, but better wine I never drank in all my life.

When wearing the ordinary head-gear a lady's dress is not considered complete unless an apron is worn, and it is not at all the thing to appear in public without one. With the _faldr_ an apron is _not_ necessary. Jon and Hannes set out early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> on the return journey to Reykjavik. I attempted to photograph them just as they were leaving the grounds at the back of our host's house, and again when the pack-train was ascending the main street, with Jon and Hannes bringing up the rear--the last I saw of them; but the shutter of the camera jammed, so the pictures were failures.

The special license had arrived; the young clergyman who was to perform the service was located at Hartledon.

But Lady Kirton was not to have it quite her own way on this same Saturday, although she had enjoyed it hitherto. A rumour reached her ears <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that Dr. Ashton was at the Rectory. The doctor had been spending Easter at Cannes, and the dowager had devoutly prayed that he might not yet return. The news turned her cheeks blue and yellow; a prevision rushing over her that if he and Lord Hartledon met there might be no wedding after all. She did her best to keep Lord Hartledon indoors, and the fact of the Rector's return from him. Now who is going to defend Lord Hartledon? Not you or I.

The hours dragged themselves by, as it is their special province to do in crises of life; and with each one that passed, he grew more convinced what her answer to his letter would be. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the little boy she employed as a messenger, put a note into his hands. COME TO ME THIS EVENING. It was all but evening now; he went, just as he was, on the heels of the child. The windows of her room were open. She sprang up to meet him, then paused. He looked desperately yet stealthily at her.

We met two little barefooted girls leading some cows, and a boy who passed us on a run, with a huge load of straw on his shoulders. The master told us that they were scholars of the second grade; that in the morning they led the cattle to pasture, and worked in the fields barefoot; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they put on their shoes and went to school. It was nearly mid-day. We encountered no one else. In a few minutes we reached the inn, seated ourselves at a large table, with the master between us, and began our breakfast at once. The inn was as silent as a convent. The master was very merry, and his excitement augmented his palsy: he could hardly eat. But my father cut up his meat, broke his bread, and put salt on his plate. In order to drink, he was obliged to hold the...", "...as also how much it surprised us to find that from the boat at high-water our eyes could wander over miles. Occasionally on the plains, rendered warm from their colour reflecting the powerful beams of the sun, were to be seen whirling clouds of dust, towering upwards until their centrifugal force became exhausted. The temperature, however, was lower about four in the morning than we had noticed it since leaving Sydney, being only 65 degrees, when easterly or land winds prevailed; those <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> were generally from seaward.

[Illustration: Corinth.] It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when we set out for the Acropolis. About a mile from the city we came to the foot of the hill, and ascended by a steep and difficult path, with many turnings and windings, to the first gate.

A scant three feet of earth could not hide its secret from him. There was death--definite and unequivocal. But for Nepeese he was still hoping and seeking. Until noon he did not go far from the site of the cabin, but only once did he actually approach and sniff about the black pile of steaming timbers. Again and again he circled the edge of the clearing, keeping just within the bush and timber, sniffing the air and listening. Twice he went hack to the chasm. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> there came to him a sudden impulse that carried him swiftly through the forest. He did not run openly now. Caution, suspicion, and fear had roused in him afresh the instincts of the wolf. With his ears flattened against the side of his head, his tail drooping until the tip of it dragged the snow and his back sagging in the curious, evasive gait of the wolf, he scarcely made himself distinguishable from the shadows of the spruce and balsams.

A delirious expectation, a rapturous sense of holding the post of danger, kept every sense in such a thrill of anticipation that the hours passed like minutes. The dusty roads, the intolerable thirst, and the nauseous, tepid water, the blistered feet, the abraded hips, where the cartridge-box began to wear the flesh--all these woes of the march were ignored in the one impulse to see the ground ahead, to note the first sight of the enemy. It was not until four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that the column was halted, and two companies, K and H, were marched out of the column and formed in platoons across the line of march, that the regiment learned with mortification that hitherto the route had been inside the Union lines! They soon saw the difference in the tactics of the march. The company was spread out in groups of four; these again were separated by a few yards, and in this order, sweeping like a drag-net, they advanced over the dry fields, through...", "...shepherd!

The next day Yan went again to the castle garden and plucked another nosegay. Then <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he drove his sheep through the village as before, playing his pipe. The princess was standing at the palace window waiting to see him. When the wind brought her a whiff of the fresh nosegay that was even more fragrant than the first one, she ran out to Yan and said: \"Yanitchko, please give me that nosegay.\" But Yan smiled and shook his head. \"Whoever wants this nosegay must say: 'My dear Yanitchko, I beg you most politely please to give me that nosegay.'\" \"My...", "...to be disappointed that there is not more of the Norman work that has been noticed in the southern tower that rises above the entrance.

The telegraph carried the happy news in every direction; and at two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> replies had already been received from Lyons, Lille, Brussels, Antwerp, Brest, and many other large towns of the Empire, which replies, as may well be imagined were in perfect accord with the sentiments entertained at the capital.

Here, at the foot of a remarkable, isolated column of rock, on which I was destined to see a strange sight in the after days, we halted and ate of the remaining food which we had brought with us, while the Amahagger consumed their own, that seemed to consist largely of curdled milk, such as the Zulus call _maas_, and lumps of a kind of bread.

The burg is only interesting by its exceedingly picturesque situation on the right bank of the Dordogne, under a very high hill, capped by a basaltic table, which is flanked towards the town, or rather a little to the south of it, by a long row of stupendous columns of basalt, known as the _Orgues de Bort_, from their resemblance at a distance to organ-pipes. The basalt here is of a reddish yellow. The table, with its...", "...knowledge of the rudiments of mathematics could do the work successfully.

But I certainly made no promise.\" Her ladyship reflected a moment, and then said:--\"I think we had better be free lances. I am most uncertain. It's a long drive.

Her eyes certainly softened. \"I will go with you to Bologna,\" she said; and that afternoon with the smallest equipment she started from Rome. Wogan had ridden alone from Bologna to Rome in four days; he had spent three days in Rome; he now took six days to return in company with Mlle. de Caprara and her few servants. He thus arrived in Bologna on the eve of that day when he was to act as the King's proxy in the marriage. It was about four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the tiny cavalcade clattered through the Porta Castiglione. Wogan led the way to the Pilgrim Inn, where he left Maria Vittoria, saying that he would return at nightfall. He then went on foot to O'Toole's lodging. O'Toole, however, had no news for him. \"There has been no mysterious visitor,\" said he. \"There will be one to-night,\" answered Wogan. \"I shall need you.\" \"I am ready,\" said O'Toole. The two friends walked back to the Pilgrim Inn. They were joined...", "...when Archie arrived, and sent for him to come in. \"Here is fifty dollars,\" he said, \"for your work of yesterday, and you will have more coming to you if these men are convicted.

AT three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Archie was seated in Mr. Van Bunting's office, together with Mr. Jennings and several of the chief members of the editorial staffs of both editions of the paper. The editors had spread out before them, on the large table, several maps, and most of them were busily engaged in making notes on little paper pads. All the time, however, an excited conversation was being carried on, for some editors wanted Archie to proceed to the Philippines one way, and some thought that...", "...and Hutton's \"Literary Landmarks.\" The chief advantage of the former is that it is bound in flaming red, and carried in the hand, advertises the owner as an American, thus saving all formal introductions. In the rustle, bustle and tussle of Fleet Street, I have held up my book to a party of Americans on the opposite sidewalk, as a ship runs up her colors, and they, seeing the sign, in turn held up theirs in merry greeting; and we passed on our way without a word, ships that pass <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and greet each other in passing. Now, I have no desire to rival the flamboyant Baedeker, nor to eclipse my good friend Laurence Hutton. But as I can not find that either mentions the name \"Rossetti,\" I am going to set down (not in malice) the places in London that are closely connected with the Rossetti family, nothing extenuating.

They seem to learn more quickly where the source of heat is and they are less likely to cause trouble from crowding. They are also less subject to disease. _Removing the Newly Hatched Ducklings to the Brooder House._ The ducklings should be left in the incubator until they are thoroughly dried off. Usually they will be dried so that they can be moved on the afternoon of the 28th day of incubation. If, however, they are not ready early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> it is best to leave them in the machine until the next morning. In moving the ducklings, place them in boxes, baskets or other suitable carriers and cover them with burlap or cloth to avoid any danger of the ducklings becoming chilled. _Brooder Houses Repaired._ There are many different types and styles of brooder houses which are used with success. For this reason only one type of each class of brooder house needed is described in detail. These particular houses have been...", "...in the whole business there is but one thing truly uncomplimentary, and that is that the French censorship, for the purpose of strangling the French press, should employ your name, the name of him who abolished censorship many weeks ago.\"[78] Even when British journalists were dealing with matters as unlikely to cause trouble as a description of the historic proceedings at Versailles at which the Germans received the Peace Treaty, the censor held back their messages, from five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> till three the next morning.[79] Strange though it may seem, it was at first decided that no newspaper-men should be allowed to witness the formal handing of the Treaty to the enemy delegates! For it was deemed advisable in the interests of the world that even that ceremonial should be secret.[80] These singular methods were impressively illustrated and summarized in a cartoon representing Mr. Wilson as \"The new wrestling champion,\" throwing down his adversary, the...", "...fame of this spot. Your guide-book will tell you the fact. \"M. de Blowitz, correspondent of the English newspaper the 'Times,' has a villa here.\" I defy you to find any other distinction special to this place. The high Normandy coast is always charming, but it is equally so at a hundred other points. And of what charm there is here simply as village, M. Blowitz's presence would seem to threaten the partial extinction. For this very presence is rendering the spot famous and crowded.

It was now late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and the men were tired of battling with the wind which buffeted their sunburned faces with sharp sand. They were crossing one of the high steppes of the middle prairie toward the belt of pines and muskegs which divides it from the barrens of the North.

Even tame ones advancing over open country will walk in single file if left to themselves. We reach a spot where the herd had evidently passed the night.

Wild elephants usually halt from about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., then move and feed until 10 or 11 a.m., when they stop and shelter from the heat of the day in thick jungle. About three or four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they get on the move again; and if they come upon water then they bathe. They travel about twenty or thirty miles in the day, though if alarmed will keep on for double that distance. While we are following this trail a loud crash ahead of us awakens the silent forest. I think at once that it is caused by the herd in whose tracks we are. But Bechan, who is a man of few words, mutters \"_bunder_\".

Although I have no conscientious scruples on the subject, it was bred into me in my childhood and boyhood that Sunday should be kept free from all manner of work; and so thoroughly was this rule inculcated that I have borne it in mind ever since, often resisting very pressing temptation to depart from it. But to-day there was no alternative, and the whole time until five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> was given to getting my draft ready. At five P.M. the American delegation came together, and, to my surprise, received my report with every appearance of satisfaction.

My draft having thus been presented, I turned it over to Mr. Low, who agreed to bring it to-morrow morning with such modifications,...", "...had to keep a sharp look-out for the Francs-Tireurs, rumours of whose wanton doings were rife amongst the peasants, who bore them a cordial hatred. About midday, we arrived at the little town of Arpajon, where we made our luncheon. What struck us, in passing through the hamlets and villages on our route, was the utterly deserted and forlorn aspect of their houses, streets, and public places. The country seemed to have become a wilderness, so far as inhabitants were concerned. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we reached Etampes, a clean little town, with wide boulevards, and a prettily planted square. Curious to tell, we did not find a single German in occupation, and had no difficulty in getting quarters. I took a stroll through the town with Mackellar and Warren. The first building which drew our attention was the parish church, standing in the principal street, and not inelegant. We entered, expecting to see everything in that state of gaudy neatness which is...", "...Laura, and she said a great deal about them needing a leader, and how much good I could do if I went into it as an enthusiastic president instead of a half-hearted one.

Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> replies began to come in to his cablegrams of the morning. Whatever their import, they quite evidently afforded him immense satisfaction, and as the early dusk settled down, his eyes began to glow with the light of battle, which those closest to him in his marvelous work had learned to recognize when victory was in sight.

Merely to say that it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the exercises were over for the day. Mr. Rockharrt and Cora Rothsay returned to the hotel to a very late dinner. The first question that the Iron King asked was whether any telegram had come for him. He was told that there was none. \"It is very strange.

The brunt of the battle fell on the American centre, composed of Campbell's and Shelby's men, who sustained the whole fight for nearly ten minutes [Footnote: Campbell MSS. Letter of Col. Wm.

General Custer thanked me for having brought him straight across the country without any trail, and said that if I were not engaged as post scout at Fort Hays he would like to have me accompany him as one of his scouts during the summer; and he added that whenever I was out of employment, if I would come to him he would find something for me to do.

Soon the curtain was drawn down again, and then he went once more to the house and took his old seat beside the table. He fell to brooding, and at last, exhausted, dropped to a troubled sleep. He woke with a start. Some one was in the room. He heard a step behind him. He came to his feet quickly, a wild light in his eyes. He faced his brother Richard. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Marion had telegraphed to Richard that Frank was coming. He had been away visiting some poor and sick people, and when he came back to Greyhope it was too late to catch the train. But the horses were harnessed straightway, and he was driven into town, a three-hours' drive. He had left the horses at the stables, and, having a latch-key, had come in quietly. He had seen the light in the study, and guessed who was there. He entered, and saw his brother asleep. He...", "...the sea with their tails, making it all of a breach and foam, was very dreadful to us, like the breach of the waves in very shoal water or among rocks. The shoal these whales were upon had depth of water sufficient, no less than twenty fathom, as I said, and it lies in latitude 22 degrees 22 minutes. The shore was generally bold all along. We had met with no shoal at sea since the Abrohlo shoal, when we first fell on the New Holland coast in the latitude of 28 degrees, till yesterday <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and this night. This morning also, when we expected by the draught we had with us to have been eleven leagues off shore, we were but four, so that either our draughts were faulty, which yet hitherto and afterwards we found true enough as to the lying of the coast, or else here was a tide unknown to us that deceived us, though we had found very little of any tide on this coast hitherto; as to our winds in the coasting thus far, as we had been within the verge of the...", "...with your low idees!

It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when he returned with the best portions of a deer swung over his shoulder. By this time he was desperately hungry, and the prospect of the first venison since his exile stirred his pulses, and gave to the bright scene a cheerful beauty it had not before worn to his homesick heart. He trudged up to the narrow door of the dugout which was closed, just as he had left it, and having carried a noble haunch of venison to the pool to be washed, he descended the dirt steps and...", "...matter over,\" said Rachel, \"and give you your answer this afternoon.

I'll jest go to headquarters an' git things ready for her.\" He was right. The prospect of doing an important service on a grand occasion was stimulus enough for Rachel's daring spirit, to make her undertake anything, and when Fortner returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he found her eager to set out upon the enterprise. But as the evening came on with its depressing shadows and silence, she felt the natural reaction that follows taking an irrevocable step. The loneliness of her unlighted room was peopled with ghostly memories of the horrors inflicted upon spies, and of tales she had heard of the merciless cruelty of the Rebels among whom she was going. She had to hold her breath to keep from shrieking aloud at the terrors conjured...", "...and gloves; small straw hat, dull green, trimmed with violets; carried a white embroidered linen sunshade and a small purse-bag, green suede with silver monogram, \"A.

Foremost stood the King. Around his shoulders fell the yellow mamo cloak, and on his head a helmet yellow as his robe save its crest which was red with the feathers of the scarlet bird.

Here I smoke four times a day--1 at breakfast, 1 half an hour before dinner, 1 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at tea, and 1 just before bed-time--but I shall give it all up, unless, as before observed, you should happen to like the smoke of a pipe at breakfast. Once when I first came here I smoked a pipe immediately after dinner; the pastor expressed his surprise: I expressed mine that he could smoke before breakfast. \"O Herr Gott!\" (that is, Lord God) quoth he, \"it is delightful; it invigorates the frame and _it clears out the mouth so_.\" A common amusement at the German...", "...that is absent in my case, for not a sigh would follow me!\" \"Ah, it is trouble that has done this!

He was about to question her categorically; but on looking at her he withheld his words. \"Yes, it is too bad to talk of,\" she slowly returned in answer to his glance. \"Can my old room be got ready for me tonight, grandfather?

The Sepoys plundered the Treasury; and it is said many of them were afterwards murdered by the...", "...and from that time until muster-out in September hotel fare was a dream of the past to which the boys looked back with considerable regret. The Prairie, completely transformed into a war ship, left the navy yard and steamed down the harbor to Tompkinsville. This was on Friday, the 13th of May, but if there was any \"hoodoo\" it failed to work. The next day the Prairie steamed out to sea and had target practice, badly frightening some of the residents of the coast with the big guns. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the Prairie gave chase to a suspicious craft which turned out to be an English tramp steamer. The Prairie had been assigned to patrol duty on the North Atlantic coast with the San Francisco. The \"Frisco\" was sighted on the day following and both ships steamed into Provincetown and remained there for the next day, sailing out late in the afternoon. It is recorded that the sailors washed clothes during their stay in Provincetown and it is evident they were getting a...", "...rocks. One man, in particular, had ensconced himself behind an enormous boulder, and had built a little wall of stone, conveniently loopholed, to protect himself when firing. The overhanging rock sheltered him from the heat of the sun. By his side were his food and a large box of cartridges. Here for the whole week he had lived, steadily dropping bullets unto the camp and firing at what an officer described as all \"objects of interest.\" What could be more attractive? At four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Major Stuart Beatsen, commanding the 11th Bengal Lancers, arrived with his leading squadron. He brought a small supply of ammunition, which the garrison was in sore need of, the expenditure each night being tremendous, some regiments firing as much as 30,000 rounds. The 35th Sikhs and 38th Dogras under Colonel Reid arrived at Dargai, at the foot of the pass, in the evening. They had marched all day in the most intense heat. How terrible that march must have been, may...", "...he would say to her. \"I can't and won't give up my afternoons, my life, to playing nurse to Donald. If you are satisfied to have him marry Miss Angela, well and good. If not--\" and then a last warning, far sharper, far more direct, than the other. But then as he waited upon her steps, and then as he looked at her in the door, the springs of this trivial anger had seemed mysteriously to subside and dry up. No doubt the Career-Maker's own look had something to do with that. Her face <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> light was seen to be thin and tired; he thought he detected faint circles under her eyes, a slightly pinched look about her nostrils. But beyond all that, beyond any question of \"sympathy,\" or cheering-up, it seemed that the affair itself had suddenly shrunk in importance. Donald's folly, Angela's little foibles, seemed to matter less to Charles as he found himself looking again at the departing heroine of his write-ups. So he discharged his bolt with restrained...", "...a nap. She did so under protest, declaring that she was not tired, but Thankful insisted. \"If you ain't tired now you will be when the excitement's over,\" she said. \"My conscience is plaguin' me enough about fetchin' you on this cruise, as it is. Just take it as easy as you can, Emily. Lie down and rest, and please me.\" So Emily obeyed orders and Mrs. Barnes, after drawing the curtains and asking over and over again if her cousin was sure she was comfortable, went out. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when she returned. \"I've been talkin' until my face aches,\" she declared. \"And my mind is about made up to do--to do what may turn out to be the craziest thing I ever DID do. I'll tell you the whole thing after supper, Emily. Let's let my tongue have a vacation till then.\" And, after supper, which, by the way, was no better than the dinner, she fulfilled her promise.

How we spoil wood by staining and painting it! The range of delicate colour in the woodwork of my room is a perfect delight.

Till 3 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that tree and the wood made me blissfully happy, but the hours between 3 and 5 seemed terribly long, and by night I was sated with the delights of bed.

Oh, how I regretted that my father was not with us! He had gone to Opelousas. He had bought several plantations in St. Martin parish, and in a region called Fausse Pointe, and in another known as the Cote Gelee.

At length came the day for us to meet at La Fontaine--a real spring near St. Martinville, belonging to Neville Declouet's uncle. About five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we gathered on the bank of the bayou. We never saw Tonton twice in the same dress. To-day she was all in blue. Suddenly the sound of distant music, and an open flat--not like our boat--approached, arched over with green branches and flowers. Benches stood about, and in the middle the orchestra played. In the prow stood the captain [Neville Declouet], and during the moments of the journey the music was mingled with the laughter and songs of our joyous company.

Philip looked after him, and pondered on what it was that had annoyed him--manner, words, or advice. He ascribed it to Guy's unwillingness to be advised, since he had observed that his counsel was apt to irritate him, though his good sense often led him to follow it.

Higher up there, George--a good deal higher.\" He ran over to direct the boys, and Mr. Skee, hands behind him, strolled up and down the garden, wearing a meditative smile. He and Andrew Dykeman had been friends for many long years. Dr. Bellair used her telephone freely after Mr. Skee's departure, making notes and lists of names. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she found Vivian in the hall. \"I don't see much of you these days, Miss Lane,\" she said. The girl flushed. Since Mrs. St. Cloud's coming and their renewed intimacy she had rather avoided the doctor, and that lady had kept herself conspicuously out of the way. \"Don't call me Miss Lane; I'm Vivian--to my friends.\" \"I hope you count me a friend?\" said Dr. Bellair, gravely. \"I do, Doctor, and I'm proud to. But so many things have been happening lately,\" she...", "...the skirmishers and lines of battle were in about the same position they had taken up the evening before. Soon after daybreak it became evident that the conflict was to be renewed, and a little later the enemy resumed the offensive by an attack along my left front, especially on Walker's brigade. His attempt was ineffectual, however, and so easily repulsed as to demonstrate that the desperate character of his assaults the day before had nearly exhausted his strength. About 3 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he made another feeble charge on my front, but our fire from the barricades and rifle-pits soon demoralized his advancing lines, which fell back in some confusion, thus enabling us to pick up about a hundred prisoners. From this time till the evening of January 3 Bragg's left remained in our front, and continued to show itself at intervals by weak demonstrations, which we afterward ascertained were directly intended to cover the desperate assault he made with...", "...life again, a free and happy woman. Her mourning was perfect. She made up her mind to see the newspaper men and have done with it. They had haunted the grounds--no patrols could keep them out--sat on the doorstep, forced their way into the kitchen, and rung the front door-bell so frequently that hourly she expected the scowling Frieda to give notice. Mr. Cummack told her repeatedly that she might as well give in first as last and she finally agreed with him. It was five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they were admitted to the spacious old-fashioned parlour with its incongruous modern notes. Like many women, Mrs. Balfame had an admirable taste in dress, so long as she marched with the conventions, but neither the imagination nor the training to create the notable room. Long since she had banished the old \"body brussels\" carpet and substituted rugs subdued in colour if commonplace in design.

The principal difference is that the fever-period of 1623-24 was...", "...and for every other disadvantage attending such a situation; there remained not a doubt with me, or any officer on board, but that we were near half a degree to the southward of the south cape, and as the distance from west to east, across this promontory, is not more than a degree and a half of longitude, or about twenty or twenty-two leagues in distance, (that is, from the south-west cape to Tasman's Head) we had every reason to think we were near round it; but at half past three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> it cleared a little in the horizon, and we saw the land bearing east; the haze was such that we could not well guess the distance, but it was very near; on this we wore the ship immediately, and stood to the westward.

But a happier lot was in store for them. On the 11th, a man working upon a hill suddenly cried out, in great ecstasy, \"The ship! the ship!\" The commodore threw down his axe and rushed with his men--all of them in a state of mind bordering on frenzy--to the beach. By five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the Centurion--for it was she--was visible in the offing: a boat with eighteen men to reinforce her, and with meat and refreshments for the crew, was sent off to her. She came happily to anchor in the roads the next day, and the commodore went on board, where he was received with the heartiest acclamations. The vessel had, during this interval of nineteen days, been the sport of storms, currents, leakages, and false reckonings; she had but one-fourth of her complement...", "...repast, and when at last they filled their pipes they were again questioned. \"We went into the reeds,\" said Sirayo, \"as you saw.\" \"We thought at first you had been killed.\" \"Yoh! we each smote our man, for they were startled; then we took their shields, called to the other four to throw them off their guard, and entered the reeds. We went through them till we came abreast of the impi. Then we lay and watched. There were four Indunas and two white men. They ate and slept, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> took medicine from the _amapakati_, a big man whom the Gaika had seen before.\" \"Eweh,\" interposed Klaas, whose eyes gleamed through the dark, \"the same who came to the kraal, and who last night crept in upon us.\" \"They took medicine and danced.

This is a very good land to fall in with, and a pleasant land to see. At three of the clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we came to three great rivers. We found a very good harbour and went in with our ship. Then we took our nets to fish and caught ten great mullets of a foot and a half long each, and a ray as great as four men could haul into the ship. The people of the country came aboard of us, seeming very glad of our coming, and brought green tobacco--they go in deer skins, well-dressed, they desire clothes and are very civil--they have great store of maize, whereof they make good...", "...Richard Evans, Edward Salcot, and other English merchants resident in the country, and with my escort and baggage, I came to the river _Tenisist_, within four miles of the city of Morocco, and pitched my tents among a grove of olive trees on the banks of that river, where I was met by all the English merchants by themselves, and the French, Flemish, and various other Christians, who waited my arrival.

The valley we travelled up in the morning was fertile, connected with several other large ones of similar character, and contained two small lakes, or large ponds of water, the least of which was elevated considerably above the low ground in the neighbourhood.

We crossed our old track twice <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and encamped in the evening under a conical hill. April 10.

At intervals he turned his back and sides and chest toward the heat and in the course of an hour succeeded in drying his underclothing to his satisfaction. His moleskin trousers were still damp, but he donned them, and renewing the fire he stretched himself luxuriously for a long and much needed rest.

There was a roar and boom and thunder of breakers down on the point and echoing far away along the coast. The wind shrieked and moaned through the forest. Under his shelter beneath the thick spruce trees, however, Eli was well enough protected. He renewed the fire, which had burned to embers, and prepared dinner. The storm that prevented him from travelling would also hold Indian Jake a prisoner. This...", "...mounted on an old white mare, rode about on every side, addressing the people in Irish, and calling upon them to give all aid and assistance to \"the expedition.\" The difficulty of the landing was much increased by the small space of level ground which intervened between the cliffs and the sea, and of which now the thickening crowd filled every spot. This and the miserable means of conveyance for our baggage, delayed us greatly, so that, with a comparatively small force, it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before we had all reached the shore. We had none of us eaten since morning, and were not sorry, as we crowned the heights, to hear the drums beat for \"cooking.\" In an inconceivably short time fires blazed along the hills, around which, in motley groups, stood soldiers and peasantry mingled together, while the work of cooking and eating went briskly on, amid hearty laughter and all the merriment that mutual mistakes and misconceptions occasioned. It was a new thing...", "...of mothers of large families, is noteworthy. For those to whom it is accessible it provides a type of entertainment which they really enjoy. It is said, in fact, that women who begin going to the park take a new interest in life. The moving pictures are especially popular. The director, a man thoroughly familiar with the lives of the families of the settlement, has sought to adapt the service of the park to their needs. Special entertainments for women with little children are given <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> while older children are in school, and mothers are encouraged to bring the babies. Mothers who have begun going to the park themselves feel greater security in allowing the older boys and girls to go to the evening entertainments and dances because they learn that there is trustworthy supervision. During the last few years, however, there has been a great change in the character of the neighborhood surrounding Dvorak Park. Bohemians have moved away, and their places...", "...very successful meeting of the Zenith Club at Daisy Shaw's, who had most unexpectedly provided a second cousin who recited monologues wonderfully. Wilbur had failed in his attempt to secure Lydia Greenway for Margaret's star-feature. The actress had promised, but had been suddenly attacked with a very severe cold which had obliged her to sail for Europe a week earlier than she had planned. Margaret had been quite ill, but Doctor Sturtevant gave her pain pellets with the result that late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she sat on her verandah in a fluffy white tea gown, and then it was that little Annie Eustace came across the street, and sat with her. Annie was not little. Although slender, she was, in fact, quite tall and wide shouldered and there was something about her which seemed to justify the use of the diminutive adjective. Possibly it was her face, which was really small and very pretty, with perfect cameo-like features and an odd, deprecating, almost painfully humble...", "...have wrought such havoc! We were like uneasy spirits; Mrs. Hopgood's apple cheeks seemed positively to wither before one's eyes. I came across a dairymaid and farm hand discussing it stolidly with very downcast faces. Even Hopgood, a hard-bitten fellow with immense shoulders, forgot his imperturbability so far as to harness his horse, and depart on what he assured me was \"just a wild-guse chaace.\" It was long before John Ford gave signs of noticing that anything was wrong, but late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I found him sitting with his hands on his knees, staring straight before him. He rose heavily when he saw me, and stalked out. In the evening, as I was starting for the coastguard station to ask for help to search the cliff, Pasiance appeared, walking as if she could hardly drag one leg after the other. Her cheeks were crimson; she was biting her lips to keep tears of sheer fatigue out of her eyes. She passed me in the doorway without a word.

Maroney went into a saloon, talked to several parties, strolled leisurely around, returned to the hotel, passed the evening till ten o'clock with a party of gentlemen, and then retired. Roch rose early, and found that the landlord, who, like most of his countrymen, possessed the good habit of being an early riser, had breakfast ready. After breakfast he took a seat on the verandah, and watched Maroney as he loitered around. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Maroney sauntered out, and started in the direction of the suburbs. Roch concluded he was going to the place where he had lost him the day before, and now he had the coveted opportunity of finding his hiding place. Walking slowly after him, smoking his pipe and gaping around, until he reached a cross-street, a block from where Maroney had disappeared before, he turned down this street, walked rapidly until he reached the next street running parallel to the one...", "...for the end of November, on the afternoon of the 19th we left Glasgow for Greenock, and went by steamer to Dublin, where, after a favourable night passage, we arrived on the 20th.

On the 23rd he spoke (by request) at the Christian Convention to an assembly of 400, consisting of ministers only, on \"What is holiness, and how is it attained?\" and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> addressed 2,000 persons at the same place on \"Faith which worketh by love.\" On Nov. 25th he spoke again at the Convention, gave an address at the noon prayer meeting also on the 26th, and immediately after closing it, gave it over again (by particular request) to an overflow meeting assembled at the United Presbyterian Church close by.

Mr. Odell-Carney was a middle-aged Englishman of the extremely uninitiative type.

Whatever preparations the police department were making to prevent the demonstration, they failed because, while as usual, we were able to calculate exactly what the police department were going to do, they were utterly unable to calculate what we were going to do.

The sight of the Campagna on one side, and of Mount Algidus, with its snow-capped fellows, and Mount Albano, with Rocca di Papa on its side, and Castel Gandolfo below on the other side, was worth the trouble--to say nothing of the little theatre, which was the most perfect example of an ancient theatre I had then seen in that pre-Pompeian period of my travels. After lunching at Frascati we strolled out to the Villa Aldobrandini, and enjoyed a brighter view of the Campagna <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sunlight. Then we lingered in a little croft enclosed by plantations, and enjoyed this familiar-looking bit of grass with wild-flowers perhaps more, even, than the greatest novelties. There are fine plantations on the hill behind the villa, and there we wandered till it was time to go back to the railway. A literally grotesque thing in these plantations is the opening of a grotto in the hillside, cut in the form of a huge Greek comic mask.

The horses were all led to the point, and the wounded who were able to ride them were mounted. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the cumbersome column was ready to move. Lieutenant Sterling's infantry had worked hard all day, and were considerably fatigued by their hard labor at the wheels of the wagons. He mounted the best horse he could find, and gave a steed to each of his men.

On the sixteenth day of April, the duke of Cumberland, having made the proper dispositions, decamped from Nairn early in the morning, and after a march of nine miles perceived the highlanders drawn up in order of battle, to the number of four thou-sand men, in thirteen divisions, supplied with some pieces of artillery. The royal army, which was much more numerous, the duke immediately formed into three lines, disposed in excellent order: and about one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the cannonading began. The artillery of the rebels was ill served, and did very little execution; but that of the king's troops made dreadful havock among the enemy. Impatient of this fire, their front line advanced to the attack, and about five hundred of the clans charged the duke's left wing with their usual impetuosity. One regiment was disordered by the weight of this column; but two battalions advancing from the second line, sustained the first, and soon put a...", "...the _Siren_ set sail for Syracuse. The blowing up of the _Philadelphia_ was one of the most daring acts ever attempted by the United States Navy, and won Decatur great credit. It weakened the Pasha's strength, and kept his pirate crews in check. Instead of making terms with the Moorish ruler, the United States decided to attack his capital, and in the summer of 1804, Commodore Preble collected his squadron before Tripoli. On August 3d the fleet approached the land batteries, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> began to throw shells into the town. The Moors immediately opened fire, both from the forts and from their fleet of nineteen gunboats and two galleys that lay in the harbor. Preble divided his ships, and ordered them to close in on the enemy's vessels, although the latter outnumbered them three to one. Again Decatur was the hero of the fight. He and his men boarded a Moorish gunboat and fought her crew hand-to-hand across the decks. He captured the first vessel, and...", "...as I walked forth into the links. At the same moment, the wind, smelling salt of the open ocean, and carrying particles of sand, struck me with its full force, so that I had to bow my head.

It was not stationary; but passed from one window to another as though some one were reviewing the different apartments with a lamp or candle. I watched it for some seconds in great surprise.

It was my first idea that a gang of thieves might have broken in and be now ransacking Northmour's cupboards, which were many and not ill supplied. But what should bring thieves to Graden-Easter?

If ever a boy put in good time I did then. However, it was evening when I reached Detroit, and I...", "...and to ascend to the summit of the range would mean a further climb of two thousand feet. In such weather the difficulties of the ascent were increased tenfold, though for evading the vigilance of the Tibetan watchmen, who spied upon our movements, we could have no better chance than a dirty night like this. I arranged with the doctor that he was to take back to Garbyang all the baggage I had discarded and the men who had declined to follow me. He must display all our tents until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the next day, so as to let the Tibetans suppose that we were all under them, and give me time to make a long forced march before they could get on our track. Hard as it would be for us going forward, we would take no tent except the small _tente d'abri_, weighing about four pounds. We should anyhow be unable to pitch one for several days, for fear of being detected by the Tibetans, who would be soon seen abroad in search of us. We should have to march long distances...", "...me the stars were winking and wheeling in squadrons back and forth as the train rounded the curves, and watching them I fell asleep.

A flat-car, by the way, is known amongst the fraternity as a \"gondola,\" with the second syllable emphasized and pronounced long. But to return. I arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and headed straight from the freight train to the falls. Once my eyes were filled with that wonder-vision of down-rushing water, I was lost. I could not tear myself away long enough to \"batter\" the \"privates\" (domiciles) for my supper. Even a \"set-down\" could not have lured me away. Night came on, a beautiful night of moonlight, and I lingered by the falls until after eleven. Then it was up to me to hunt for a place to \"kip.\" \"Kip,\" \"doss,\" \"flop,\" \"pound your ear,\"...", "...this he was aware of a peculiar gain. His sense of hearing now was most acute, and he could hear the least faint sounds--sounds which, before his taking to the open, he could not have heard. So he was enjoying it all, feeling real comfort, a kind of fitness, as if he belonged here and would better remain here for ever. Then, with a generous supply of alfalfa tossed to him, as to the other horses, he became convinced that he should remain in this little settlement for all time.

It was twenty miles away, and there was here a well of water and a grove of trees. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he saw the party approaching. It consisted of the merchants, two armed Arabs, and the five captives, all of whom were carrying burdens. They were crawling painfully along, overpowered by the heat of the sun, by the length of the journey, and by the weight they carried. Several times the Arabs struck them heavily with their sticks to force them to keep up. Geoffrey retired from the other side of the clump of trees, and lay down in a depression of the sand hills until...", "...genteel, nor very artistically cut and made; and they were threadbare, and patched at the knees and elbows. A patch is no disguise to a man or boy, it is true; but if a little more care had been taken to adapt the color and kind of fabric in Harry's patches to the original garment, his general appearance would undoubtedly have been much improved. Whether these patches really affected his ultimate success I cannot say--only that they were an inconvenience at the outset. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before John Lane had unloaded his merchandise and picked up his return freight. Thus far Harry had been unsuccessful; no one wanted a boy; or if they did, they did not want such a boy as Harry appeared to be. His country garb, with the five broad patches, seemed to interfere with the working out of his manifest destiny. Yet he was not disheartened. Spruce clerks and ill-mannered boys laughed at him; but he did not despond. \"Try again,\" exclaimed he, as often as he...", "...for them she had left behind. As he saw her there, content was on her face, and a mild radiance and wonder; and her new companions were pleasant to her. She would go away with them--she was content to be with them--she would disappear among them, and leave no sign. And Sunday morning after Sunday morning he would look in vain for her coming through the church-yard, under the trees; and there would be a vacant place in the pew; no matter who might be there, one face would be wanting; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the wide meadows would be empty.

The latter was not an offering to the sacred image, but it was placed on the revered spot so that none of Gregorio's men should touch it.

We passed the tributary river Roncador on the left side, with its beautiful high waterfall a short distance before it enters the Tapajoz. We came soon afterwards to the island of S.

Four mortal hours were lost on the lonely siding. There was no station, and Blount could not telegraph. So far as he knew, the service-car might stay there for a day or a week. It was all to no purpose that he quarrelled with his conductor. The train crew had orders to wait for the west-bound time freight, and there was nothing to do but to keep on waiting. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the time freight, or some other train, came along, and the special was once more set in motion eastward, but at dinner-time it was again side-tracked, eighty-odd miles from its destination, and once more at a desert siding where there was no telegraph office. The car was still standing on the siding when Blount went to bed. But in the morning it was in motion again, jogging now on its leisurely way up the branch line.

But, you're in pretty bad shape.\" He did not tie the rope, but let it drop on the floor while he brought a small tin tub full of warm suds, and gently sponged the dog's body. The next thing was cool salve on the painful sores. Then Jan was ready to follow this kind friend, and though his legs trembled with weakness, he hastened with the old man into a large room with dirt floor. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and the light from two small windows left the place in partial darkness, so that Jan, coming into it, could not see anything at first. But, he heard dogs whining and barking all about him. When he grew accustomed to the dim light, the old man had tied him and gone away. A number of dogs were fastened by short ropes, and all were staring at the big dog.

Lord Lyttelton, Mr Walpole, Mrs Macaulay, and Mr Garrick, have all written me noble letters about it. There are two Dutch translations going forward.' General Oglethorpe, an old veteran who had seen service under Prince Eugene, and the friend of Pope whose verses upon him 'I had read from my early years,' called upon him and solicited his acquaintance. He became a sort of literary lion. 'I am really the great man now,' he cries; 'I have David Hume in the forenoon, Mr Johnson <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day.

It was a circular space surrounded by a palisade twice the height of a man. Inside the palisade, and round about, was a multitude of boxes and seats rising one above the other. The structure had no roof, but above the boxes extended cloth of various colors, cut like wings of butterflies, which, sprinkled with fragrant water, were moved to cool the atmosphere. When the viceroy appeared in his box, the Asiatics and Egyptians...", "...That would be a cinch. So then I sat in the dug-out and just waited for the tide to come up. The dug-out stayed where it was on account of being pushed in among the reeds and oh, jiminety, it was nice sitting there. I thought maybe the creek would empty out again into Bridgeboro River and I could tie up there and, go home. But I had a big surprise waiting for me, you can bet. It was about nine o'clock in the morning when I started on that crazy trail and it was about five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the tide began to turn and go back. All the while I was sitting there waiting I thought about the Indian that owned that canoe. Maybe his bones were down underneath there, I thought. Ugh, I'd like to see them. No, I wouldn't. Maybe he was on his way to a pow-wow, hey? Well, after a while when the tide turned I started paddling down.

The gale continued unabated, with squalls and rain, until noon of the 4th, although the barometer had been rising since the previous midnight; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the wind moderated, and the weather became fine. From this it would appear that the barometer gives ample warning of an approaching North-West gale, as it had been falling nearly four days before the commencement of the bad weather, this alone ought to be sufficient to put a man upon his guard if near the shore.

Kermit was hastily despatched to notify our camp and the work of preparing the skins of the elephants was at once begun. In the meantime, we at our camp, eight miles away from the scene of battle, were waiting eagerly for news of the hunting party, although expecting nothing for a day of so. It seemed too much to expect that the hunt should have such a quick and successful termination. So when Kermit rode in with the news late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> it was a time for felicitation.

Only the killing of a lion had been sufficient provocation for taking off the \"lid,\" but on the strength of three elephants for the group the \"lid\" was momentarily raised with much ceremony and circumstance.

I had left Tiflis about 3 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 5th of September, and reached this place in the evening of the 9th, five days to travel 274 wersti (195 miles). I call that a respectable Russian post! The boat did not start for Redutkale, a distance of eighty wersti, until the morning of the 11th. It was bad weather; and the Ribon, otherwise a fine river, cannot be navigated during a strong wind, on account of the projecting trunks of trees and logs. The scenery still continued beautiful and...", "...absence of the other two, or perhaps her sense of numbers was defective, and she could not count. However that may be, she devoted herself with concentrated fervor for some minutes to the two limp and bedraggled little forms striving passionately to stir them back to life. Then, as if realizing on the sudden that they were dead, she almost spurned them from her, sprang to her feet with a long yowl, and ran around the pool till she again picked up John Hatch's trail. It was about four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when John Hatch crossed the last of the half-bare slopes, with their scant growth of poplar and sapling birch, which fringed the foot of Old Sugar Loaf, and plunged into the dark spruce woods which separated him from his lonely farm on the banks of Burnt Brook. His trail was now an easy one, an old and moss-grown \"tote-road\" of the lumbermen. It was some ten or a dozen years since this region had been lumbered over, and by this time the young timber which had then been...", "...armful of the gray moss or lichen that almost covered many of the spruce trees, hanging down from them and giving them the appearance of being bearded with age, there came a wild burst of rain and hail that rattled on the bark walls like bullets. The rest of that day and night and most of the next day rain fell with scarcely a pause. The disgusted gold-seekers were compelled to remain within shelter, going out only long enough to cut wood for the fire and to catch a few fish. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the rain ceased, and the gray clouds showed signs of breaking. Hares seemed to be plentiful on the island, and Etienne went out to set some snares, while the two boys climbed up through the dripping woods, over slippery moss and rocks, to a spot where they could see out over the lake. The water was still rough, but the wind had shifted to the north and gave promise of clearing weather. They hoped they might be able to go on by morning. According to Etienne the Rock of...", "...with Colonel Ibbetson to \"make me--a violent, morose, and vindictive-natured man--imbrue my hands in the gore of my relative and benefactor--a man old enough to be my father--who, indeed, might have been my father, for the love he had bestowed upon me, with his honored name, when I was left a penniless, foreign orphan on his hands.\" Here I laughed loud and long, and made a most painful impression, as is duly recorded in the reports of the trial. The jury found me guilty quite early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the second day, without leaving the box; and I, \"preserving to the last the callous and unmoved demeanor I had borne all through the trial,\" was duly sentenced to death without any hope of mercy, but with an expression of regret on the part of the judge--a famous hanging judge--that a man of my education and promise should be brought by his own evil nature and uncontrollable passions to so deplorable an end. Now whether the worst of certainties is better than...", "...long as you are well dressed and you have money to lose. At Monte Carlo you must always keep up an appearance. I've known a millionaire to be refused admittance because his trousers were turned up.\" At this she laughed, and then lapsed into a long silence, for on a stretch of wide, open road I was letting the car rip, and at such a pace it was well-nigh impossible to talk. A mystery surrounded my _chic_ little travelling-companion which I could not make out. At about two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we pulled up just beyond the little town of Chauceaux, about thirty miles from Dijon, and there ate our cold provisions, washing them down with a bottle of red wine. She was hungry, and ate with an appetite, laughing merrily, and thoroughly enjoying the adventure. \"I was so afraid this morning that you were not coming,\" she declared. \"I was there at seven, quite an hour before you were due.

Colonel Baker went over about two o'clock in the afternoon. By constant effort, he succeeded in getting about seventeen hundred men over during the day, and three cannon,--two mountain howitzers and one rifled gun. It was nearly three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before General Evans began the attack. He had captured a courier the day before, sent by General McCall to General Meade, and from the despatches learned that General McCall was only making a reconnaissance. This information led him to bring all his forces back to Leesburg, and it also delayed his attack until late in the afternoon. Captain Duff, of the Seventeenth Mississippi, was reinforced first by four companies of the Thirteenth and Eighteenth Mississippi,...", "...they proposed, that I should continue my route by their houses; but the old guide, who was now preparing to leave us, informed me that it would lengthen my journey; and by his advice I proposed to them to conduct us along the road which had already been marked out to us. This they undertook without the least hesitation; and, at the same time, pointed out to me the pass in the mountain, bearing South by East by compass. Here I had a meridian altitude, and took time. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we parted with our late fellow-travellers in a very friendly manner, and immediately forded the river. The wild parsnip, which luxuriates on the borders of the lakes and rivers, is a favourite food of the natives: they roast the tops of this plant, in their tender state, over the fire, and taking off the outer rind, they are then a very palatable food. We now entered the woods, and some time after arrived on the banks of another river that flowed from the mountain,...", "...24, 1916. East of Rappe Wood and to the north of Wavrille Wood they assembled strong forces. Two French battalions succeeded in carrying part of the wood, and were then held up by machine-gun fire. Fosses Wood and Beaumont were deluged by German shells of every caliber. An infantry attack gave the Germans the southern edge of Wavrille Wood, where the French clung tenaciously. Fosses Wood, then Beaumont, were captured, then La Chaume Wood. The French situation had become serious. At 2.20 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a large force of Germans advanced between Louvemont and Hill 347, and though the French made desperate efforts to stay the advancing waves, Les Chambrettes, Beaumont, and Fosses and Caures Woods were occupied by the enemy.

I heard from some merchants yesterday that Arrekel Bey, the Governor, had come back to Massowah; so I hope, if this is true, he will keep the steamer for me if I am late. I sent on some of my servants to Beatmohar, K.'s house, to-day, to let his boy Waldemariam know that I was coming, so as to make everything ready for me. Hadji Mahomet was behind with the rest of my donkeys, and I was afraid they would not arrive at Massowah in time to catch the steamer. I started <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and climbed the steep hill which lies between Chickut and the table-land of Asmarra. It was a lovely view as we ascended, and looked even more charming in the daytime than it had looked in the light of a tropical moon, the condition under which we last saw it. I passed by Sellaadarou, the place where we had encamped, and saw the remaining marks of the two large bonfires we had made. After leaving this place I met some natives on the road; one of them was carrying in...", "...finest thing of all, Anne. 'Twould be an excellent idea, Martha, for us to ask the neighborhood in to hear it read.\" But Mrs. Stoddard shook her head, and said Anne must not think too well of what, after all, was Miss Rose Freeman's book as much as it was Anne's. \"You must not overpraise our little maid,\" she warned Captain Enos reprovingly. But the book was ever one of Mistress Stoddard's most valued treasures, and was kept with \"Pilgrim's Progress\" in the big chest. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before all the dishes, pewter, the fine new table-cloths, and the pretty brown cloth for Mistress Stoddard's new gown, were unpacked. \"This package is for Amanda,\" Anne said, holding up a good-sized bundle. \"For Amanda, indeed!\" exclaimed Mistress Stoddard. \"I'm not too sure that she deserves it.

And now a fine present for her--I do not know about it.\" \"Oh, Aunt...", "...with his wife and family from a two-years' tour in Europe. _Sunday, 17th._ At four o'clock this morning we got into bad weather again, and the state of things at breakfast-time was unutterably miserable.

It has slightly moderated since (between two and three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I write), and the sun is shining, but the rolling of the ship surpasses all imagination or description. We expect to be at Halifax about an hour after midnight, and this letter shall be posted there, to make certain of catching the return mail on Wednesday. Boston is only thirty hours from Halifax.

Ah, me! why was I born under an unlucky star? Get busy now, Jack, and tell us all about it. Next to being a hero myself I like to hear about you doing big things. Reel off the yarn now, and don't you dare hold back a single thrill.\" Of course the other boys were deeply interested in what Jack had to tell. They stopped him many times to ask questions, under the belief that he was not going deeply enough into details. But finally the story was told. Toward four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they began to realize that they were drawing near a large and busy city on the eastern shore. Boats could be seen upon the river, and cotton began to be in evidence everywhere. \"This is Memphis, all right,\" said Jack, as he looked through the glasses at the buildings on the high bank of the river. \"How long will we stay here?\" asked Nick, who had some idea on his mind, as the others readily understood from his abstracted manner. \"A day or two,\" replied Jack....", "...had work to do. She visited all her favorite trees,--the purple ash, the vivid, passionate maples, the oaks in their sober richness of murrey and crimson. On each and all she levied contributions, cutting armful after armful, and carried them to the house, piling them in splendid heaps on the shed-floor. Then, after carefully laying aside a few specially perfect branches, she began the work of decoration. Over the chimney-piece she laid great boughs of maple, glittering like purest gold <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> light, which streamed broadly in through the windows. Others--scarlet, pink, dappled red, and yellow--were placed over the windows, the doors, the dresser. She filled the corners with stately oak-boughs, and made a bower of the purple ash in the bow-window,--Faith's window.

Pray for forgiveness!\" Then death claimed her, and her earthly sorrows were ended.

Father Capel had striven in vain to dissuade him from making the attempt to reach the villa. \"There is safety only in the sheltered heights,\" said the priest. \"By this time the valleys are submerged, and the dwellings therein are being swept away.

She wanted him to feel that it was home from the moment he crossed the threshold. So, with Biddy's help, she went about her preparations, enlisting the old nurse's sympathies till at last she succeeded in arousing her enthusiasm also. There was certainly no time to weep. That second day after her arrival was the day of the funeral. It was a beautiful still day of summer, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Dinah and Biddy sat in the garden overlooking the winding river, and read the Burial Service together. It was Dinah's suggestion, somewhat shyly proffered, and--though she knew it not--from that time forward Biddy's heart was at her feet. Whatever tears there might be yet to shed had lost all bitterness from that hour. \"I'll never be lonely so long as there's you to love, Miss Dinah darlint,\" Biddy murmured, when the young arms closed about her neck for a moment ere...", "...of her own thoughts. \"What you said about the revolver--that your father could not have had it?\" \"The revolver?\" she repeated half wearily; \"oh yes.

After Frank had left <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I went into the room where he had been waiting, to finish dusting.

Then when I was dusting the desk I saw that the revolver was no longer there.\" \"You had occasion to open the drawer?\" \"It is really a very old bureau and none of the drawers fit closely.

Sand went back to the Weinberg, and sat down to the midday table d'hote, where he dined with an appearance of such calmness, and even of such happiness, that his conversation, which was now lively, now simple, and now dignified, was remarked by everybody. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he returned a third time to the house of Kotzebue, who was giving a great dinner that day; but orders had been given to admit Sand. He was shown into a little room opening out of the anteroom, and a moment after, Kotzebue came in. Sand then performed the drama which he had rehearsed upon his friend A. S.

Most of the morning I spent trying, with Correll's help, to get the declination needle to set. Its pivot had been destroyed in transit and Correll had replaced it by a gramophone needle, which was found too insensitive. There was nothing to do but use the three-inch theodolite, which, setting to one degree, would give a good result, with a mean of thirty-two settings, for a region with such variable magnetic declination. A latitude \"shot\" was made at noon, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I took a set of dip determinations. These, with a panoramic sketch from the camp, a round of angles to conspicuous points and an observation at 5.30 P.M. for time and azimuth completed the day's work. Correll did the recording. Meanwhile, McLean had built an eight-feet snow mound, erected a depot flag upon it and taken several photographs. The next day was devoted to an excursion to Aurora Peak. The weather was, to our surprise, quite clear and calm.

The Monarch II was certainly a marvel in its construction and scope. It had been made to accommodate an operator and one, or even two, passengers. The seating space was quite roomy, and there was a handy basket-like compartment, arranged to hold wraps, provisions and duplicate machine parts. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the Monarch II was rolled out into the broad roomy yard of the factory. Everything was in order for the finest start in the world. Dave had thought out and mapped out every detail of the proposed air voyage. Mr. Randolph personally superintended all the initial arrangements. The starter worked liked a charm.

Finally, one person returned to his company, and told them that at a considerable distance he heard a kind of human voice underground; to which place they repaired, and making loud cries to the hole of the shaft, he forthwith answered them that he was there alive, and prayed their assistance in order to deliver him from that tremendous place; whereupon, immediately they set on tackle ropes and windlass on the old shaft, so that a tinner...", "...get it across the bar.

W., ten miles. The shore is low, with some small inlets in it, and sand banks with shoal water run off more than two miles; at six miles out there is a hummocky island and four rocks, one of which was at first taken for a ship. We passed within these, as captain Cook had before done; and at half past two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> anchored in Keppel Bay, in 6 fathoms soft bottom, three-quarters of a mile from a head on the east side of the entrance. My object in stopping at this bay was to explore two openings marked in it by captain Cook, which it was possible might be the entrances of rivers leading into the interior. So soon as the ship was secured, a boat was sent to haul the seine, and I landed with a party of the gentlemen to inspect the bay from an eminence called _Sea Hill_. There were...", "...the wake of two smaller vessels, which had been despatched a fortnight before--with the Filipinas merchandise. Don Lope de Ulloa was their commander, while Doctor Antonio de Morga left those islands in the almiranta, the \"Santo Espiritu,\" to fill the office of alcalde of the court of Mexico. Before leaving the bay, both vessels were struck head on by a storm, and went dragging upon the coast, buffeted by the heavy seas and winds, and amid dark and tempestuous weather, from three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> until morning of the next day, notwithstanding that they were anchored with two heavy cables in the shelter of the land, and their topmasts struck. Then they grounded upon the coast, in La Pampanga, ten leguas from Manila. The storm lasted for three more consecutive days. Consequently it was regarded as impossible for those vessels to sail and make their voyage, inasmuch as the season was now well advanced, and the vessels were very large and heavily laden, and were...", "...what use would they be to a poltergeist? On one occasion, only, I caught a glimpse of the miscreant. It was about eight o'clock on a warm evening in June, and I was sitting reading in my study. The room is slightly below the level of the road, and in summer, the trees outside, whilst acting as an effective screen against the sun's rays, cast their shadows somewhat too thickly on the floor and walls, burying the angles in heavy gloom. In the daytime one rather welcomes this darkness; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> it becomes a trifle oppressive, and at twilight one sometimes wishes it was not there. It is at twilight that the nature of the shadows usually undergoes a change, and there amalgamates, with them, that Something, that peculiar, indefinable Something that I can only associate with the superphysical. Here, in my library, I often watch it creep in with the fading of the sunlight, or, postponing its advent till later--steal in through the window with the moonbeams, and I...", "...I determined to trust to the chapter of accidents; and, armed with a knapsack, a sketch-book, and an air-gun, took my seat one morning in the Foggia diligence, with the vague idea of getting as near the scene of operations as possible, and seeing what would turn up. The air-gun was not so much a weapon of offence or defence as a means of introduction to the inhabitants. It had the innocent appearance of rather a thick walking-cane, with a little brass trigger projecting; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I would join the group sitting in front of the chemist's, which, for some reason or other, is generally a sort of open-air club in a small Neapolitan town, or stroll into the single modest cafe of which it might possibly boast, and toy abstractedly with the trigger.

The elder thief began watering the plant early in the morning, and as he had been told to go on pouring water till some of it collected itself round the foot of the plant he went on pouring bucketful after bucketful: but to no purpose. No sooner was the water poured on the foot of the plant than it was forthwith sucked up by the thirsty earth; and it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the thief, tired with drawing water, laid himself down on the ground, and fell asleep. The younger thief fared no better. The cow which he had to tend was the most vicious in the whole country. When taken out of the village for pasturage it galloped away to a great distance with its tail erect; it ran from one paddy-field to another, and ate the corn and trod upon it; it entered into sugar-cane plantations and destroyed the sweet cane;--for all which damage and...", "...I concluded, however, by assuring him, that whatever plan they had meditated to pursue, it was my fixed and unalterable determination to proceed, in spite of every difficulty that might oppose, or danger that should threaten me.

No. I, only, had that. For, as I drew from his arm, a meteoric crimson, shooting across the pale face bent over work there, flashed upon me, and then a few great tears, like sudden thunder-drops, falling slowly and wetting the heavy fingers. The long mirror opposite her reflected the interior of the alcove parlor. No,--he could not have seen, he must have felt her.

Davis was at church when he received Lee's dispatch. The congregation was dismissed with the notice that there would be no evening service. The rebel government left Richmond about two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 2d.

As soon as I was sure of this I notified Sheridan and directed him to move out on the Danville Railroad to the south side of the Appomattox River as speedily as possible. He replied that he already had some of his command nine miles out. I then ordered the rest of the Army of...", "...knife under her coverings. Ida came in, and began to get her own breakfast.

So much caution was not universally deemed essential; it was argued that the French seemed already committed to full retreat, they ought not to be allowed to get away without punishment, and it followed that the German Army should strike without delay.

He did not feel certain that he had accomplished much. It all depended on the reliability of the urchin. Ralph went back to the roundhouse and told the foreman he could do nothing further toward locating Ike Slump until nightfall, and put <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at his regular duties, although Forgan told him he need not do so. Ralph went home at quitting-time, got his supper, explained to his mother that he had something to attend to for the foreman, and not to worry if he was not back early. He reached the rendezvous agreed on at dusk, and after a few minutes' waiting saw the little fellow of the morning coming down the tracks. \"I'm here,\" announced the new arrival. \"So am I, as you see,\" answered Ralph. \"How did...", "...see more than three hundred yards around, the gum-trees are so thick, and the small belts of lancewood make it very deceptive. Should any one be so unfortunate as to be lost, it would be quite impossible to find them again; it would be imprudent to search for them, for by so doing the searchers would run the risk of being lost also. Arrived at Auld's Ponds and camped. Wind, south-east. A few clouds. Sun day, 25th May, Auld's Chain of Ponds. Proceeded to the Depot, where I arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and found all well. No natives have been near them, although some of their smoke has been seen at a short distance from the Depot. Yesterday we hoisted the Union Jack in honour of her Most Gracious Majesty's birthday, that being the only thing we had to commemorate this happy event, with our best wishes for her long and happy reign. Wind, south-east. Monday, 26th May, Chain of Ponds. Removed the party on to Auld's Chain of Ponds. Tuesday, 27th May, Auld's Chain of...", "...like telling him what he was bound to know, for he promised to come and ask me every day.\" \"This was when?\" asked Thad. \"I think it must have been about noon when they lowered me at the end of a rope,\" Aleck went on to explain. \"One of the men knew about that ledge, and the idea seemed to tickle Kracker more than a little. They just shoved me over, and it was keep a tight hold on that rope for me, or a drop to the cruel rocks away down at the foot of the precipice. Then, late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I saw you come into the valley far below. I wanted to shout, at first, but was afraid you were only some of the other hard cases of silver mine hunters like Kracker. But I had found out in the meantime that in crevices of the rock some small trees had once taken root, several of them dying, so that I amused myself in breaking off pieces of wood and starting a little fire deep in a fissure I found, and which they didn't know anything about, I guess. \"Then, to my...", "...man lives, their look seemed to say. As though to confirm their doubts Hassan, who understood or guessed what was passing, asked by what right we were promising freedom to his slaves. \"By right of that,\" I answered, pointing to the Union Jack which Stephen still had in his hand. \"Also we will pay you for them when we return, according as they have served us.\" \"Yes,\" he muttered, \"you will pay me for them when you return, or perhaps before that, Englishman.\" It was three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before we were able to make a start. There was so much to be arranged that it might have been wiser to wait till the morrow, had we not determined that if we could help it nothing would induce us to spend another night in that place. Blankets were served out to each of the bearers who, poor naked creatures, seemed quite touched at the gift of them; the loads were apportioned, having already been packed at Durban in cases such as one man could carry. The pack saddles...", "...from the pent nostril, spectacle bestrid.\" It also occasions loss of appetite, frequent sickness at the stomach, with many other disagreeable symptoms. A case in point, is related by Dr. Cullen, of a woman who had been in the habit for twenty years. At length she found on taking a pinch before dinner, she had no appetite. This having frequently occurred, she was induced to postpone her pinch till after dinner, when she ate her meal with her accustomed relish, and went on snuff-taking <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> without inconvenience. Another instance is related by the same author, of the injurious effects of this habit. A lady, who had been accustomed to take snuff freely, was seized with a severe pain in her stomach, which continued unabated notwithstanding many remedies were applied; until accidentally her snuff was omitted for a few days, when the pain was found to subside, and did not return until she again had recourse to her snuff. Then, to her utter astonishment, it...", "...\"Well, we shall see what we shall see. Perhaps, it will come as an amazing disclosure to him that I've been on the sound side of this question all along.\" He began the work of cutting from the papers the accounts of the Loutois kidnapping. As he read them, he built up a tentative outline showing who the kidnappers were and where they probably had secreted the boy. He grew absorbed, whistling in a low key. So far as he was concerned, the Withers case was a closed incident. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he called Greenleaf on the telephone, and announced: \"I'm leaving town for a few days tomorrow morning.\" \"Again! What for?\" the chief asked. \"They've asked me to work out that kidnapping case in New Orleans--the Loutois child.\" \"Good! I'm glad to hear it; I congratulate you.\" Greenleaf was sincerely pleased. He felt that he had sponsored and developed the lame man as a detective. \"Thanks. Before I go, I want to have a talk with you. We might as well go...", "...Most of the inhabitants are tillers of the soil, but the maritime natives are naturally occupied chiefly in the fisheries, and it is a very pretty sight, at any little fishing village, to see the boats start out for the hoped-for haul. Just before sunrise scores of little fishing-boats with bamboo masts and huge triangular mat-sails slip out of the creeks before the fresh land-wind, which lasts just long enough to carry them to the fishing-ground in the offing, and about four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a sea-breeze springs up, and back they all come, generally laden with splendid fish. The evening breeze often attains such strength that the little boats would capsize if it were not for a balancing-board pushed out to windward, on which one or two, or sometimes three, men stand to act as a counterpoise, so that it may not be necessary to shorten sail. The Malays excel in boat-building, and rank very high in the art of shaping vessels which offer the least possible...", "...with fatigue, used all her natural rhetoric, which was very powerful, mingled with tears that flowed from the heart, in persuading Aurelia to enjoy some repose; and so far she succeeded in the attempt, that for one night the toil of travelling was intermitted. This recess from incredible fatigue was a pause that afforded our adventurer time to overtake them before they reached the metropolis, that vast labyrinth, in which Aurelia might have been for ever lost to his inquiry. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day which succeeded his departure from the White Hart, that Sir Launcelot arrived at the inn, where Miss Aurelia Darnel had bespoke a dish of tea, and a post-chaise for the next stage. He had by inquiry traced her a considerable way, without ever dreaming who the person really was whom he thus pursued, and now he desired to speak with her attendant. Dolly was not a little surprised to see Sir Launcelot Greaves, of whose character she had conceived a very...", "...uninjured. The date of our departure the Red Cross gave a fine dinner for all who were going to leave the camp. This was the custom with that society when any soldiers left there for the Philippines. All those who left while I was there partook of a splendid dinner just before leaving. This society, in addition to the dinner given to us, had several hundred dollars worth of provisions put on board our transport, and all marked, \"For enlisted men only on deck.\" At three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the seventeenth day of October, 1898, we sailed on board the transport \"Senator.\" The provisions put on board for us were well cared for--by the officers, who took charge of them and guarded them so well that if an enlisted man got any of them, he had to steal them from under a guard. Actually had to steal what belonged to him by gift, and if caught stealing them he was court martialed, and fined enough to buy his rations for a month, but the fine money was not...", "...said to have been built not far off; but at the present day not a vestige of it remains. The road to this garden already lies partly in the desert. At first the way winds through avenues of trees and past gardens; but soon the vast desert extends to the right, while beautiful orange and citron groves still skirt the left side of the path. Here we continually meet herds of camels, but a dromedary is a rare sight. EXCURSION TO THE PYRAMIDS OF GIZEH. August 25th, 1842. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I quitted Cairo, crossed two arms of the Nile, and a couple of hours afterwards arrived safely at Gizeh. As the Nile had overflowed several parts of the country, we were compelled frequently to turn out of our way, and sometimes to cross canals and ride through water; now and then, where it was too deep for our asses, we were obliged to be carried across. As there is no inn at Gizeh I betook myself to Herr Klinger, to whom I brought a letter of recommendation from...", "...interest in a general way, was doubly so to those who were such near neighbours to a place of the kind. This visit Mark now decided to make on his way to leeward, taking the volcano in his course to Rancocus Island. The _detour_ would lead the Neshamony some fifteen or eighteen leagues on one side; but there was abundance of time, and the volcano ought to be no longer neglected. The wind did not blow as fresh as in common, and the Neshamony did not draw near to the volcano until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day she sailed. The party approached this place with due caution, and not without a good deal of awe. As the lead was used, it was found that the water shoaled gradually for several leagues, becoming less and less, deep as the boat drew near to the cone, which was itself a circular and very regular mountain, of some six or eight hundred feet in height, with a foundation of dry rock and lava, that might have contained a thousand acres. Everything seemed solid and...", "...as the Baptists of the lower class in England would be but too apt to do--tormented him by telling him that he was not sure of heaven, because he went to church instead of joining their body. But he, though he went to chapel in wet weather, clung to his own creed like an old soldier; and came down to Massa's house to spend the Sunday whenever there was a Communion, walking some five miles thither, and as much back again. So much I learnt concerning old Isaac. And when <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he toddled away, and back into the forest, what wonder if I felt like Wordsworth after his talk with the old leech-gatherer?-- 'And when he ended, I could have laughed myself to scorn to find In that decrepit man so firm a mind; God, said I, be my help and stay secure, I'll think of thee, leech-gatherer, on the lonely moor.' On the Monday morning there was a great parade. All the Coolies were to come up to see the Governor; and after breakfast a long...", "...loneliness, I picked up a pair of collie dogs that were so newly free that they were urgently willing to return to their allegiance to man. These collies accompanied me for many years, and the strains of them are in those very dogs there that you boys have to-day. But in sixty years the collie strain has worked out. These brutes are more like domesticated wolves than anything else.\" Hare-Lip rose to his feet, glanced to see that the goats were safe, and looked at the sun's position <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sky, advertising impatience at the prolixity of the old man's tale. Urged to hurry by Edwin, Granser went on. \"There is little more to tell. With my two dogs and my pony, and riding a horse I had managed to capture, I crossed the San Joaquin and went on to a wonderful valley in the Sierras called Yosemite. In the great hotel there I found a prodigious supply of tinned provisions. The pasture was abundant, as was the game, and the river that ran through the valley...", "...they became frantic with terror, and needed no urging in their impetuous race. The Indians were often within sixty feet of their victims, and bullets and arrows flew thickly around the trappers. But both parties being on the fiercest run, and there being interposing obstacles of rocks, and shrubs, and trees, accurate aim was impossible. As the fugitives drew near their camp, the Indians relinquished the pursuit. One of the men had been struck by an arrow and wounded. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when these heroic men were all re-assembled around the camp-fires, to recount the adventures of the day. With the sleeplessness of the preceding night, and the toil and peril which the rising sun had ushered in, they were all exceedingly exhausted. Still the consciousness that they were surrounded by a vigilant and powerful foe, rendered it necessary for them to adopt every precaution for their safety. They tethered their horses with very great care, near their camp....", "...fire with a paper lighter. He was often out of his chair to get a book from the shelves that lined the walls, either for a passage which he wished to read, or for some disputed point which he wished to settle. If I had caused the dispute, he enjoyed putting me in the wrong; if he could not, he sometimes whimsically persisted in his error, in defiance of all authority; but mostly he had such reverence for the truth that he would not question it even in jest. If I dropped in upon him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I was apt to find him reading the old French poets, or the plays of Calderon, or the 'Divina Commedia', which he magnanimously supposed me much better acquainted with than I was because I knew some passages of it by heart. One day I came in quoting \"Io son, cantava, io son dolce Sirena, Che i marinai in mezzo al mar dismago.\" He stared at me in a rapture with the matchless music, and then uttered all his adoration and despair in one...", "...of mind, having sent the things away. 17th. Visited this morning by my old friend Mr. Ch. Carter, who staid and went to Westminster with me, and there we parted, and I to the Wardrobe and dined with my Lady. So home to my painters, who are now about painting my stairs. So to the office, and at night we all went to Sir W. Pen's, and there sat and drank till 11 at night, and so home and to bed. 18th. All this morning at home vexing about the delay of my painters, and about four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> my wife and I by water to Captain Lambert's, where we took great pleasure in their turret-garden, and seeing the fine needle-works of his wife, the best I ever saw in my life, and afterwards had a very handsome treat and good musique that she made upon the harpsicon, and with a great deal of pleasure staid till 8 at night, and so home again, there being a little pretty witty child that is kept in their house that would not let us go without her, and so fell a-crying by...", "...remembered the coldness of Ruth when he saw her in the church, and felt that he was not equal to meeting her, much as he longed to be in her presence. So he sent a note pleading sickness. It was not a lie, for there was a dull pain in both head and heart. All the afternoon he walked along the bluff road, studiously avoiding Saunders who had seemed desirous of accompanying him, for Mark wanted to be alone. Taking no note of the distance, he walked on for miles. It was already late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when he turned to go back, yet he had not thought out any solution to his own problem, nor how to approach Father Murray in behalf of the Bishop. To Mark Griffin pain of any kind was something new. He had escaped it chiefly by reason of his clean, healthful life, and through a fear that made him take every precaution against it. He did not remember ever having had even a headache before; and, as to the awful pain in his heart, there never had been a reason for its...", "...cheeks and noses blue in a moment, but they kept on, calling \"Biddy, Biddy, Biddy!\" in their shrill sweet trebles. Every twig on the trees was glittering white with hoar-frost, and all the dead blackberry-vines wore white wreaths, the bushes brushed the ground, they were so heavy with ice, and the air was full of fine white sparkles. The children's eyes were dazzled, but they kept on, stumbling through the icy vines and bushes, and calling \"_Biddy, Biddy, Biddy_!\" It was quite late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they started, and pretty soon the sun went down and the moon arose, and that made it seem colder. It was like traveling through a forest of solid silver then, and every once in a while a little frozen clump of flowers would shine so that they would think it was the silver hen and dart forward, to find it was not. About two hours after the moon arose, as they were creeping along, calling \"Biddy, Biddy, Biddy!\" more and more faintly, a singular, hoarse voice...", "...my stock of fresh water, which was begun to be low, and partly for the sake of discovering this part of the coast. I was invited to go further by seeing from this anchoring-place all open before me, which therefore I designed to search before I left the bay. So on the 11th about noon I steered further in, with an easy sail, because we had but shallow water. We kept, therefore, good looking out for fear of shoals, sometimes shortening, sometimes deepening the water. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we saw the land ahead that makes the south of the bay, and before night we had again sholdings from that shore, and therefore shortened sail and stood off and on all night, under two top-sails, continually sounding, having never more than ten fathom, and seldom less than seven. The water deepened and sholdened so very gently, that in heaving the lead five or six times we should scarce have a foot difference. When we came into seven fathom either way, we presently...", "...season of the year, and the air was wonderfully bright and clear. The atmosphere being in a state of equilibrium (so the doctor told us), was ready to obey even the slightest impulse, and to rush towards any spot where rarefaction was taking place. Thus, at about ten in the morning, as the rays of the sun gain power and shed their influence over the earth, the air from the sea begins to move towards it. As rarefaction increases, so does the strength of the wind, till by three or four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> it rushes in with great force, creating a considerable sea, and if a vessel is not well moored, driving her before it. Captain Frankland knew what to expect, and was therefore prepared for the emergency. On the afternoon of our return to Valparaiso, we put to sea. From the cause I have mentioned respecting the strength of the sea-breeze, it is necessary to make a good offing from the land. We therefore stood off shore till we had sunk the tops of the Andes below...", "...kept him going until, toward eight o'clock, he drew up behind a lofty pile of slabs and sawdust at the old mill. A wilder storm never filled the resounding forests of the North. The old mill was far from being proof against the fine, icy snow; but when George rolled himself in his heavy blanket and lay down beside his dog, it was to go to sleep to the comfortable munching of the horse, and with the thought that Herbert and the turkeys were safe. And they were safe. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the next day when George, having left the wagon at the mill, came floundering behind the horse through the unbroken road into the streets of the junction, to find Herbert anxiously waiting for him, and the turkeys, with full crops, trying hard to go to roost inside their double-decked car. CHAPTER III WHITE-FOOT The December rain was falling down, down, down, as if the drops were lead instead of water. The December sky, if you could call it sky, had...", "...been turned over,\" said Jim. \"Look here, boys, I have found an old plow.\" We looked at it with real curiosity. It was certainly a primitive article, made of grey weathered wood and the plowshare also of some hard wood, just enough to stir the ground. \"These people must have been independent here and happy too,\" said Tom. \"It was a shame they had to be run out by those Apaches.\" We had now advanced to the edge of the mesa and were looking off to the west. It was a marvelous view <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> light that brought out the strange and symmetrical lines of the desert architecture with startling distinctness. \"There rolls the Colorado and hears no sound save its own rolling,\" said Jim, pointing in his most oratorical manner to the southwest. \"You can see the zigzag of it through that plateau,\" I cried. \"Yes, and way over there in the south is where it plunges into the mountains,\" said Jim. \"Jove! it makes me anxious to reach it. This will be our last...", "...happiness, and joy, as only those know to whose lot it has fallen to sleep the sleep of the really happy. And thus it was every night. I fell asleep before my prayers were ended, sang in the morning, and felt light-hearted almost to reckless gaiety, happy and ready for work the whole day long. This proved how truly Susanna had said that our love would become to me a spring of health, better than any doctor's human wisdom could devise. CHAPTER X _THE STORM_ It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the Saturday after Twelfth Night that the terrible two days' storm began, which is still spoken of by many as one of the most violent that has visited Lofoten within the memory of man. It was fortunate that the fishing had not yet begun--the storm raged with grey sky, sleet, and tremendous seas from the south-west right up the West Fjord--or perhaps as large a number of wrecks might have been heard of as in the famous storm of 1849, when in one day several...", "...a character so noted, that I could easily find him. I hastened to my dinner, and reached Mrs. Greenough's rather late. I explained the reason of my tardiness, which was quite satisfactory. My landlady hoped that I should recover my money, and I hoped so too--a degree of unanimity which does not always exist between landlady and boarder. I was on the work as the clock struck one, but I had to do some running that noon, in order to protect my reputation. Conant did not drive business <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> as he had in the forenoon, when I think he intended to wear me out. We worked steadily, and I kept my end of the board up. I was not sorry to hear the clock strike six, for I was tired, though perhaps not more so than Conant himself. I went home, ate my supper, did my chores in the house, and at seven o'clock I was in the bar-room of the Planters' Hotel. It was no place for a boy, or a man either, for that matter. No one was what could be called, in good society,...", "...difficulty in keeping the haggard, distressed look from her face. Her tender, hopeful eyes were not so bold or so merry as on the day before; cheerfulness cost her an effort, but she managed to keep it fairly alive. Her escort, wretched and half-starved, never forgot the deference due to their charge, but strode steadily on with the doggedness of martyrs. At times she was impelled to disclose her true identity, but discretion told her that deception was her best safeguard. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the second day the front axle of the coach snapped in two, and a tedious delay of two hours ensued. Baldos was strangely silent and subdued. It was not until the misfortune came that Beverly observed the flushed condition of his face. Involuntarily and with the compassion of a true woman she touched his hand and brow. They were burning-hot. The wounded man was in a high fever. He laughed at her fears and scoffed at the prospect of blood-poisoning and the hundred...", "...with me next year. Your aunts are very rich, I am sure, and I just know that they will not think of permitting you to earn your own living.\" Nan stood looking thoughtfully out of the open library window. \"I would rather be independent,\" she declared. Then, noting her friend's dismal expression, she laughingly caught her hands as she said, \"Well, we won't decide the matter, now. I'll talk it over with Aunt Dahlia when she comes.\" The two girls spent a happy morning together and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Nan said, \"I wonder why Aunt Dahlia and Aunt Ursula do not come. They wrote that they would be here early and take us both for a long drive.\" Another half hour passed and then there was a knock at the door. Nan sprang up joyously. \"It's Marie to tell me that my dear aunts have arrived.\" It was indeed Marie, who held out a yellow envelope as she said, \"This telegram just came, Miss Anne. Mrs. Dorsey isn't in, so I thought I'd better bring it right up to you.\"...", "...and the journey to Washington which he had planned for that day. With a start of horror he looked at his watch and found he had but a few hours in which to try to make up for the remissness of yesterday before the evening coach left for Philadelphia. It was as if some guardian angel had met his first waking thoughts with business that could not be delayed and so kept him from going over the painful events of the day before. He arose and hastened out into the world once more. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he found the man he was to have met the day before, and succeeded in convincing him that he ought to help the new enterprise. He was standing on the corner saying the last few words as the two separated, when Kate drove by in a friend's carriage, surrounded by parcels. She had been on a shopping tour spending the money that David had given her, for silks and laces and jewelry, and now she was returning in high glee with her booty. The carriage passed quite near to David...", "...the conflicting claims of her lover and her parents. In the year 1850 fifty thousand crossed the Plains. In 1851 immigration fell off because even at that early date there was a business \"depression,\" almost a \"panic\" in California, but in 1852 it increased again, and the Plains became a thoroughfare, dotted so far as the eye could see with long trains of white-covered wagons, moving slowly through the dust. In one day a party from Virginia passed thirty-two wagons, and during a stop <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> five hundred overtook them. In after years the course of these wagons could easily be traced by the alien vegetation which marked it. Wherever the heavy wheels had broken the tough prairie sod there sprang up, from the Missouri to the Sierras, a narrow belt of flowering plants and familiar door-yard weeds,--silent witnesses of the great migration which had passed that way. Multitudes of horsemen accompanied the wagons, and other multitudes plodded along on foot....", "...talk to them--if I could tell them--they might be made to understand. I haven't been a newspaper reporter all these years without acquiring a golden gift of persuasiveness. Perhaps--who knows?--we may meet again in Vienna. Stranger things have happened.\" Frau Nirlanger shook her head with a little hopeless sigh. \"You do not know Vienna; you do not know the iron strength of caste, and custom and stiff-necked pride. I am dead in Vienna. And the dead should rest in peace.\" It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Von Gerhard and I turned the corner which led to the building that held the Post. I had saved that for the last. \"I hope that heaven is not a place of golden streets, and twanging harps and angel choruses,\" I said, softly. \"Little, nervous, slangy, restless Blackie, how bored and ill at ease he would be in such a heaven! How lonely, without his old black pipe, and his checked waistcoats, and his diamonds, and his sporting extra. Oh, I hope they have all those...", "...brief inspection of buildings about which they knew nothing, of the big, yellow Palace, of this church and that, of the Morro and the harbor, of sunny days, and of late afternoons along the Prado and the Malecon. To me, Havana is losing its greatest charm through an excess of Americanization, slowly but steadily taking from the place much of the individuality that made it most attractive. It will be a long time before that is entirely lost, but five-story office buildings, automobiles <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> parade, steaks or ham and eggs at an eight or nine o'clock breakfast, and all kinds of indescribable hats in place of dainty and graceful _mantillas_, seem to me a detraction, like bay-windows and porticos added to an old colonial mansion.

It isn't New York at all, but I love it, and I let them put their name on the programme. They really don't charge me more than twice as much as they ought to for my hats. We go down here,\" she added, descending some steps, \"and if you make eyes at any of the young women I shall bring you straight out again.\" They spent half an hour choosing a hat and nearly two hours over lunch. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before she dropped him at his rooms. Not a word had they spoken of Sylvanus Power or their future, but Philip was a different man. Only, as he turned and said good-by, his voice trembled. \"I can't say thank you,\" he muttered, \"but you know!\"... The lift was too slow for him. He opened his door with almost breathless haste. He only paused to light a cigarette and change his coat and wheel his table round so as to catch the afternoon light more perfectly. Then, with...", "...to talk to Captain Hurtrell, to my great sorrow, for I had really formed a liking for the man, notwithstanding the fact that he was a Rebel, and a commander of prisoners. The next day we all had to leave Macon. Whether we were able or not, the order was imperative. Great was my joy when I learned that we were on the way to Savannah and not to Andersonville. We traveled over the same road, so well described in one of your articles on Andersonville, and arrived in Savannah sometime <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 21st day of November, 1864. Our squad was placed in some barracks and confined there until the next day. I was sick at the time, so sick in fact, that I could hardly hold my head up. Soon after, we were taken to the Florida depot, as they told us, to be shipped to some prison in those dismal swamps. I came near fainting when this was told to us, for I was confident that I could not survive another siege of prison life, if it was anything to compare to-what I...", "...a good chap.\" On leaving Pall Mall Godfrey took a cab to Bond Street, and for upward of an hour paced religiously up and down that fashionable thoroughfare. Then, taking another cab, he drove to Euston, where he spent at least three-quarters of an hour inspecting the various trains that passed in and out of the station, pottering about the bookstalls, and glaring at the travellers who approached him. As every one is aware who lives in the neighbourhood, there is only one good train <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that stops at Detwich, hence his reason for going to the station at that hour. As the time approached for that train to leave, he grew more and more nervous, and when the train itself at length backed into the station to take up its passengers, his anxiety became almost pitiable to watch. Placing himself near the bookstall, he scrutinized every passenger who approached him. At last he became aware of two figures, who were making their way leisurely along the platform...", "...of godliness, to have declined very much since my coming into Cornwall, but especially since I went to St. Hilary. Sat up late, and read the last chapter and other parts of Revelation, and was deeply affected. Prayed with more success than lately. _July 31._--Read and prayed this morning with increasing victory over my self-will. Romans vii. was particularly suitable; it was agreeable to me to speak to God of my own corruption and helplessness. Walked <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to Redruth, after having prayed over the Epistle to the Ephesians with much seriousness. On the road I was enabled to triumph at last, and found my heart as pleased with the prospect of a single life in missionary labours as ever.

So tell me what things you want and I'll pack them for you.\" \"I couldn't think of troubling you,\" he protested. \"I'm not sick, you know. Just a cracked rib and a jolt on the head. I feel all right, really.\" \"You do as you're told,\" she...", "...to John Goodgroome, a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, who is also referred to in the Diary.] to me (recommended by Mr. Mage), with whom I agreed presently to give him 20s. entrance, which I then did, and 20s. a month more to teach me to sing, and so we began, and I hope I have come to something in it. His first song is \"La cruda la bella.\" He gone my brother Tom comes, with whom I made even with my father and the two drapers for the cloths I sent to sea lately. At home all day, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> came Captain Allen and his daughter Rebecca and Mr. Hempson, and by and by both Sir Williams, who sat with me till it was late, and I had a very gallant collation for them. At night to bed. 26th. To Westminster about several businesses, then to dine with my Lady at the Wardrobe, taking Dean Fuller along with me; then home, where I heard my father had been to find me about special business; so I took coach and went to him, and found by a letter to him from my aunt...", "...the globe. Since we left Kothan we have covered a hundred and fifty kilometres in four hours. It is not a high rate of speed, but we cannot expect on this part of the Transasiatic the same rate of traveling we experienced on the Transcaspian. Either the Chinese engines are not so fast, or, thanks to their natural indolence, the engine drivers imagine that from thirty to forty miles an hour is the maximum that can be obtained on the railways of the Celestial Empire. At five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we were at another station, Nia, where General Pevtsoff established a meterological observatory. Here we stopped only twenty minutes. I had time to lay in a few provisions at the bar. For whom they were intended you can imagine. The passengers we picked up were only Chinese, men and women. There were only a few for the first class, and these only went short journeys. We had not started a quarter of an hour when Ephrinell, with the sferious manner of a merchant...", "...the calamity, they give it also a certain natural atmosphere; they are in painful harmony with it. But when the shock, the dreadful business of the moment, is all over, when the funeral has gone away from the doors and the dead has been buried, and everything goes on as before, this commonplace renewal is, perhaps, the most terrible of all to the visionary soul. Minnie and Chatty got out their work,--the coloured work, which they had thought out of place during the first week. They went <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> for a walk, and gathered fresh flowers, as they returned, for the vases in the drawing-room. When evening came they asked Theo if he would not read to them. It was not a novel they were reading; it was a biography, of a semi-religious character, in which there were a great many edifying letters. They would not, of course, have thought of reading a novel at such a time. Warrender had been wandering about all day, restless, not knowing what to do with himself. He was not...", "...to leave this apparently commanding position, feeling sure that his over-confident foe would occupy it as a manifest vantage-ground. On December first the hostile army appeared, marching in five columns, and before night the two divisions of the center were drawn up, on and behind the plateau of Pratzen; the three which composed the left were on and before its southern slopes. Their movements and their position convinced the experienced observer that his information was exact. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> was held a council of war in which every general received the most minute directions. Soult especially was carefully instructed as to the \"manoeuver of the day\"--an advance in echelon, right shoulder forward. Nicely poised combinations need careful attention, and the uneasy but confident Emperor spent the night passing from watch-fire to watch-fire, encouraging and observing his men. With noisy enthusiasm they besought him not to expose his life on the morrow, and...", "...taken into custody. I have forwarded the bond, which you boys unconsciously were carrying on the Black Growler, to the bank to be restored to its proper owners.\" After the boys went to their rooms they were still discussing the story of the lost bond. The fact that one of the gang, which had forced its way on board the boat while they were passing through the Erie Canal, had turned out to be a detective, was sufficient to arouse the keenest interest among the Go Ahead boys. Indeed, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they insisted upon Mr. Brown accompanying them once more while they made another test of the racing motor-boat on the course. Mr. Brown, upon the insistence of the Go Ahead boys, related many of the stirring experiences which he had had as a detective and when he departed, after they had returned to the island, they were all delighted with the changed man. How he had been able to pass himself among the professional bank thieves as one of their number was an...", "...of yourself?\" \"Yes; will you let me go now?\" \"Come then, I'll put you in your train with your bag; and don't you go and speak to anyone about what happened here, and then you'll be quite safe.

There were clothes enough in her bag to last her for some time with those she was wearing, and money in her purse--two or three shillings in small change and the sovereign which had been in her possession for several months. Food and shelter could therefore be had, and she was not a poor girl in rags now, but well dressed, so that she could go without fear or shame to any registry office to seek an engagement. These thoughts...", "...much larger; the jolting is altogether more complete and effective. Still, you remember the doctrine that the _volante_ cannot upset, and this blind faith to which you cling carries you through triumphantly.

His guests settled themselves to slumber and were not disturbed for the rest of the night. Frank's first act on reaching Erzerum <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the next day was to lock up the carpet securely in his strong room. The warehouse was an annexe at the back of the dwelling-house. This was a substantial building of stone, backing on a hillside, with a flat roof covered, like the most of the better houses in the town, with green turf. It had a large arched door, but small windows, hardly bigger than portholes, filled, however, with glass, and not with oiled paper, which the natives commonly used. Mr. Forester...", "...night of the 2d a fine position on Erlington Heights, from which the enemy could be shelled out of his new position by artillery; that he occupied and held that position by a squadron and howitzer until driven from it by the enemy at two o'clock in the afternoon of the 3d; that he reported of that position to Generals Lee and Jackson during the night of the 2d. Other accounts go with that of Stuart. It seems that the \"foot cavalry\"[38] and the reserve divisions met at the landing late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 3d. The troops from the Valley district had not been engaged in the battles of the march except that of Gaines's Mill. At daylight of the 4th I rode to the front, and ordered General Jackson to drive in the enemy's skirmishers and prepare to attack. D. R. Jones's division of Magruder's command, coming up, was ordered on Jackson's left, A. P. Hill's on his right; my own division to support Jackson's direct move for Erlington Heights. After pushing the skirmish...", "...Gelderland.] [Footnote 146: Walter Webley, nephew of Colonel Lewis Morris.] [Footnote 147: Greenwich.] _8th, Sunday._ We staid at home this morning for the purpose of writing and resting ourselves. Gerrit requested me to shave him, as did also an old countryman of Nevesinck who lodged at our house, which was the first time in my life that I had ever shaved any one. It afforded us an opportunity of speaking to this countryman about various matters touching the country. We intended <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to attend the English service, but, on going to the fort, the sentinel told us there was no English preaching in the afternoon, and we returned home. _9th, Monday._ We remained at home to-day, except that I went out to ascertain whether there was any way of going over to Staten Island. Meanwhile we began to dispose of some of our large merchandise. Gerrit went out to Sapokan, to do some carpenter's work. We tasted to-day some very fine grapes. _10th, Tuesday._...", "...Hon.

As I sat in my room at the President's, the smoke of the burning mansion was visible; but business was transacted with as much quietness as if the foe were hundreds of miles distant. Mr. Fox, the assistant Secretary of the Navy, had in a private note informed the President that if there should be a necessity for him to leave the city he would find a steamer in readiness at the wharf at the foot of Sixth Street.

Nearly all the forces had been sent forward to reinforce Grant, and the city was comparatively defenseless. But its slender garrison, mostly raw recruits, held out gallantly under the encouragement of the President, until Grant sent a column to attack...", "...watch them. She used to try to sketch them too, but she was too weak; and when I wrote home for her, she made me describe them----\" \"In her bright way!\" said his mother. \"I read the letters over and over again and they seemed like pictures--like her little pictures. It scarcely seems as if Lucien could have written them at all.\" \"The last day,\" said Latimer, \"I had written home to say that she was better.

Yet all the sides of the question tortured me. I asked the valet <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> about the woman that had spoken to me. He shrugged his shoulders, and said she was only a peasant that the general was tired of, but that she would not leave him, although he beat her. He beat her!\" There were tears in my eyes at the intensity with which he spoke, but Dr. Polnitzski's were dry. He clenched his strong hands as if he were crushing something. Then he shook himself as if he were awaking, and threw back his head with a bitter attempt at a laugh. \"Bah!\"...", "...that on the whole it didn't matter. And to simplify the business thoroughly I had declared I didn't believe anything at all. They confuted me by texts from Scripture which I now perceive was an illegitimate method of reply. When I got home, still impenitent and eternally lost and secretly very lonely and miserable and alarmed, Uncle Nicodemus docked my Sunday pudding. One person only spoke to me like a human being on that day of wrath, and that was the younger Frapp. He came up to me <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> while I was confined upstairs with a Bible and my own thoughts. \"'Ello,\" he said, and fretted about. \"D'you mean to say there isn't--no one,\" he said, funking the word. \"No one?\" \"No one watching yer--always.\" \"Why should there be?\" I asked. \"You can't 'elp thoughts,\" said my cousin, \"anyhow.

For beds we...", "...look deepened into curiosity, and by and by she asked: \"Youse didn't live there too, did youse?\" Our common misfortune inspired me to a cordial reply, and we fell into a discussion of the catastrophe. Her English was so sadly perverted and her voice so guttural that I could make out her meaning only with the greatest exercise of the imagination. But it was to the effect that the fire had started in a room on the top floor, whither poor old Mrs. Pringle had gone about three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with a bucket of coal for the fire. Just what happened nobody knew. Every one on the top floor at the time had perished, including Mrs. Pringle. \"Didn't youse get nothin' out, neither?\" asked my companion. And then it dawned upon me for the first time that I had nothing in all the world now but the clothes on my back and the promise of work on the morrow. \"Yes, I have lost everything,\" I answered. \"Youse got anything in the bank?\" she pursued. The question...", "...ten miles, but by the night of the 5th we were getting past the disturbed locality and the dip had increased considerably. For the first time on the trip the wind veered round to the south-east. Snow had fallen overnight (December 5) and had drifted in long ramps diagonally across the sastrugi. In two and a half hours we covered two and a quarter miles, blindly blundering in an uncertain light among crests and troughs and through piles of soft, new snow. Then we stopped; Webb filling <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with a full set of dip observations. That night the break-wind played its one possible trick. Waking on the 8th, we found that the heavy snowfall, with only a moderate wind, had drifted us up. Of course Hurley and I, who slept on the 'outsides,' had known it most of the night.

It was all mischief, for I intended to do my best. Mrs. Knight threw open her nice rooms, and in the hall room off the back parlor the tree was placed.

Suddenly, above the confused noises of the night, the loud notes of a piano broke, and the woman whose voice he had heard <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> began once more with appalling vigour to sing. The child moaned. Mrs. Garvin started up hysterically. \"I can't stand it--I can't stand her singing that now,\" she sobbed. Thirty feet away, across the yard, Hodder saw the gleaming window from which the music came. He got to his feet. Another verse began, with more of the brazen emphasis of the concert-hall singer than ever. He glanced at the woman beside him, irresolutely. \"I'll speak to her,\" he said.

Now this was just the very thing the refractory Parson expected; therefore he rode round overnight and bade every farmer in the neighbourhood send all his hands with pickaxes and shovels, by four o'clock the next morning: also he gathered all his own men there, as well as the unclad folk who were entirely at his orders. Then he sent for Parson Jack, as being the strongest man about there, and imparted his intention to him, and placed him over the workmen. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the Bishop's state-carriage was descried moving up the Tiverton highroad, with a noble and imposing aspect. Before he arrived at the cross-road leading off to Nympton Rectory, his Lordship was surprised to see a great collection of people standing on a hill above the road, and all saluting him with the deepest respect. \"Not so bad after all,\" he exclaimed; \"brother Chowne has brought his men into good order, which is the noblest use of the Church. Ah! they don't see a...", "...They all scattered at the approach of the Indians. She thought they were all killed. She would sit looking into space, calling, \"Mine schilder! Mine schilder!\" enough to break your heart. I thought she had gone crazy when I saw her look up at the sound of a child's voice, then begin to climb on the table calling, \"Mine schilder! Mine schilder!\" In a group on the other side she had seen four of her children that had escaped and just reached the fort that Wednesday morning. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the long expected fighting began. We were all sent up stairs to stay and obliged to sit on the floor or lie prone. All the windows were shot in and the glass and spent bullets fell all around us. I picked up a wash basin heaping full of these and Mrs. Dunn as many more. By evening the savages retired, giving their awful war whoops. Thursday there was very little fighting as the rain wet the Indians' powder. Mrs. Dunn, Mrs. Sweatt and I spent the time making cartridges...", "...pointing below, said: \"Look!\" Rupert looked over the battlement, and saw a little party issue from a small postern gate far below him, cross the broad fosse, and pause in an open space formed by an outlying work beyond. They bore with them a box. \"A funeral?\" Rupert asked. The man nodded. \"They all go out at last,\" he said, \"but unless they tell what they are wanted to tell, they go no other way.\" Five minutes later Rupert was again locked up in his cell, when he was, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day, visited by the governor, who asked if he would say where he had taken Mademoiselle Pignerolles. \"You may as well answer,\" he said. \"You will never go out alive unless you do.\" Rupert shook his head. \"I do not admit that I know aught concerning the lady you name; but did I so, I should prefer death to betraying her.\" \"Ay,\" the governor said, \"you might do that; but death is very preferable to life at Loches.\" In a day or two Rupert found...", "...all along the western horizon. Mosquitoes had got into his room during the day, and after he threw himself upon the bed they began sailing over him with their high, excruciating note. He turned from side to side and tried to muffle his ears with the pillow. The disquieting sound became merged, in his sleepy brain, with the big type on the front page of the paper; those black letters seemed to be flying about his head with a soft, high, sing-song whizz. VIII Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the sixth of August, Claude and his empty wagon were bumping along the level road over the flat country between Vicount and the Lovely Creek valley. He had made two trips to town that day. Though he had kept his heaviest team for the hot afternoon pull, his horses were too tired to be urged off a walk. Their necks were marbled with sweat stains, and their flanks were plastered with the white dust that rose at every step. Their heads hung down, and their breathing...", "...night, unexpected and unannounced. During the day, as long as I had the advance, Captain Craig Wadsworth of Sheridan's staff rode by my side to represent and report to his chief. No very important incident happened, but the weather was pleasant, the air was exhilarating, the companionship was congenial, and there was sufficient of excitement to make it interesting. Things were kept moving, and it was very enjoyable, as service with the advance of a marching column always is. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we passed Chilesburg and the country began to have a familiar look. It was not yet dark when we crossed the North Anna river at Anderson's bridge and the First division prepared to bivouac on the south side. Gregg and Wilson went into camp for the night north of the river. After crossing the river, Custer was ordered to proceed with his brigade to Beaver Dam station. Here the First Michigan was given the advance, Major Melvin Brewer with one battalion as advance...", "...but it was enfiladed from a neighbouring height. Bonaparte, at the siege of Saint Jean d'Acre, was destitute of siege artillery, and was not master of the sea. He had, therefore, many more obstacles to encounter than Ibrahim. During the first ten days the cannonade of the besiegers was not very vigorous, but on the 9th of December, five frigates having cast anchor before the place, with some gun-boats under sail, a general attack was made, and from eight in the morning until four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the fleet and the batteries on shore kept up a well-directed fire. The besieged on their side were not inactive. The Egyptians experienced a heavy loss, and several of their ships were much cut up. From the 9th to the 18th the bombardment lasted night and day. On the 10th some heavy guns were placed in battery. The operations of the siege were now pushed forward with great ardour, but yet nothing denoted the immediate reduction of the place. The defence of Ab-dallah...", "...me many miles of walking, and increased my importance in the eyes of the heathen. I was taking it to the capital for sale. It was a big-boned rough-hewn animal, of superior intelligence, and I was authorised to sell it, together with its saddle and bridle, for four pounds. Like most Chinese mules it had two corns on the forelegs, and thus could see at night. Every Chinaman knows that the corns are adventitious eyes which give the mule this remarkable power. We were on our way early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 7th, going up the valley. Below the curiously draped pagoda which commands Tongchuan we met two pairs of prisoners, who were being led into the city under escort. They were coupled by the neck; they were suffering cruelly, for their wrists were so tightly manacled that their hands were strangulated, a mode of torture to which, it will be remembered, the Chinese Government in 1860 subjected Bowlby, the _Times_ correspondent, and the other prisoners seized with...", "...Mr. Langmore's life and his business dealings with people in this vicinity.\" CHAPTER XIX ADAM ADAMS MAKES A NEW MOVE It was not until an hour later that Adam Adams left Martha Sampson's cottage. He had gained from Raymond all the information he could and also the names and addresses of half a dozen people he thought to interview. He spent what was left of the forenoon in the town, calling at the bank, and on a lawyer and one of the merchants, and about three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> made his way once more to the vicinity of the Langmore mansion. Here, to his surprise, he ran into Charles Vapp. \"Is your man around here?\" he asked, as the pair met in the shadow of some bushes. \"Yes, went into the house five minutes ago.\" \"Have you learned anything unusual?\" \"Not much. He has been around arranging his business affairs and he met Miss Bernard and the two had a confidential talk, but I couldn't get close enough to hear what was said. After...", "...this outburst. He looked down at the check in his hand, then looked out the window; he could see Thady Shea climbing into the buckboard and driving off. \"Aiblins, yes; the man's mad!\" he reflected. A slow chuckle came to his lips. \"And to think I never so much as said thank'ee! If the check's good, now--h'm! Better find out about it. A fool, that's what the fellow is. A loose-brained fool.\" He sought the telephone and spoke with the Silver City bank. The check was good. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> came the first word of the actual thief who had made off with the seven stone gods. One of the men brought in a report that he had found signs of a camp on the creek a mile distant. Mackintavers and Old Man Durfee went out to investigate. They were good at reading signs; they discovered that a man had spent the previous night in this spot, and that he had presumably been an Indian. The tracks of his unshod horse showed a cracked off hind hoof. A few tiny shreds of gray...", "...for months. But she dared not miss any chance. For it was coming home to her that she might die of starvation in this prison long before her people found the place. By morning search parties would be out over the hills looking for her. But who would think to find her away over on Del Oro? If Brad had carried out his threat immediately and gone down to Battle Butte, nobody would know even the general direction in which to seek. With every hour Beulah grew more troubled. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she fired a fourth shot from her revolver in the hope that some one might hear the sound and investigate. The sun set early for her. She watched its rays climb the wall of her prison while she worked half-heartedly with the spur. After a time the light began to fade, darkness swept over the land, and she had to keep moving in order not to chill. Never had she known such a night. It seemed to the tortured girl that morning would never come. She counted the stars...", "...own house, and to that of Mr. Welden (who had asked him to dine), Sir Edmund seems to have dined nowhere. Had he done so, even in a tavern, he must have been recognised. Probably Godfrey was dead long before 9 P.M. Mr. Justice Wild pressed Prance on this point of where Godfrey was; he could say nothing.* Much evidence (on one point absurd) was collected later by L'Estrange, and is accepted by North in his 'Examen,' to prove that, by some of his friends, Godfrey was reckoned 'missing' <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the fatal Saturday.** But no such evidence was wanted when Hill, Berry, and Green were tried.*** The prosecution, with reckless impudence, mingled Bedloe's and Prance's contradictory lies, and accused Bedloe's 'Jesuits,' Walsh and Le Fevre, in company with Prance's priests, Gerald and Kelly.**** Bedloe, in his story before the jury, involved himself in even more contradictory lies than usual. But, even now, he did not say anything that really implicated the men...", "...detachment being brought to the left of the road, it was proposed to attack by a flank movement, what, at the moment, was supposed to be only the rear guard of the retiring army. But after a quick examination of the field by Dobbins and McCoun, who discovered large bodies of Mexicans in motion on our left, while the road, in front, was held by lancers, McCall resolved to despatch three dragoons to the commander in chief with the news and await his arrival. It was about four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that General Taylor came up with the skirmishers and received an exact report of the enemy's position. Lieutenant Ridgely, who, upon the Major's fall, had succeeded to the command of Ringgold's battery, was immediately ordered to advance on the highway, while the fifth infantry and one wing of the fourth were thrown into the chapparal with McCall's command on the left, at the same time that the third and the other wing of the fourth entered the thicket on the right...", "...when at last we reached the consulate building again, and when, after having had a good bath, we are able to enjoy a cup of tea. \" ... In the early hours of March 13th our steamer arrived at Tsingtau. I was surprised and delighted with what I saw. There, in spite of innumerable difficulties, a city had sprung up in an incredibly short space of time. \"Rooms had been reserved for us at the handsome, but very cold, Hotel Prinz Heinrich; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day of our arrival we strolled up the roads, which were still somewhat dusty, and in parts only half finished, to the summit of the hill where the acting Governor and the officers of higher rank had their homes. Even though it is true that up to now military necessities have taken precedence in the laying-out of the town, so that the needs of trade and traffic have not received due attention, it must be admitted that a...", "...[Illustration: THRESHING.] [Illustration: AN AFTERNOON SIESTA.] The scholars in a Chinese school are expected to be on hand at an early hour, and by sunrise they are, perhaps, howling vigourously away. When it is time for the morning meal they return to their homes, and as soon as it is finished, again return. About noon they are released for dinner, after which they go back as before to school. If the weather is hot, every one else--men, women, and children--is indulging <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> siesta, but the scholars are in their places as usual, although they may be suffered to doze at their desks as well as they can, for half the rest of the day. In this way the discipline of the school is supposed to be maintained, and some allowance made at the same time for poor human nature. Were they allowed to take a regular nap at home, the teacher fears with excellent reason that he would see no more of them for the day. If Chinese pupils are to be pitied in the...", "...bestows.\"] Amelia now threw herself into a chair, complained she was a little faint, and begged a glass of water. The doctor advised her to be blooded; but she refused, saying she required a vent of another kind. She then desired her children to be brought to her, whom she immediately caught in her arms, and, having profusely cried over them for several minutes, declared she was easy. After which she soon regained her usual temper and complexion. That day they dined together, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they all, except the doctor, visited Captain Atkinson; he repaired to the bailiff's house to visit the sick man, whom he found very chearful, the surgeon having assured him that he was in no danger. The doctor had a long spiritual discourse with Robinson, who assured him that he sincerely repented of his past life, that he was resolved to lead his future days in a different manner, and to make what amends he could for his sins to the society, by bringing one of the...", "...were well affected, assured us that the lady to whom the letter was addressed, Miss Susan Blake by name, was one of the most forward in the Protestant Cause. She was well known and much respected, and she kept a school for young gentlewomen, where many children of the Nonconformist gentry were educated. He instructed us to proceed directly to her house, and to ask her to procure for us a decent and safe lodging. He could not have given us a letter to any better person. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when we rode into Taunton. The streets were full of people running about, talking now in groups and now by twos and threes; now shouting and now whispering; while we rode along the street, a man ran bawling-- 'Great news! great news! Monmouth is upon us with twice ten thousand men!' It seems that they had only that day learned of the defeat of the Militia by the rebels. A company of the Somerset Militia were in the town, under Colonel Luttrell, in order to keep...", "...squeak and scream of the roundabouts in the Fair could be heard dimly penetrating the sanctities and privacies of the Precincts. But it was the Cathedral bells, pealing, crashing, echoing, rocking, as early as nine o'clock in the morning, that first awoke the consciousness of most of the Polcastrians to the glories of the day. I suppose that nearly all souls that morning subconsciously divided the order of the festival into three periods; in the morning the Cathedral and its service, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the social, friendly, man-to-man celebration, and in the evening, torch-light, bonfire, skies ablaze, drink and love. Certain it is that many eyes turned towards the Cathedral accustomed for many years to look in quite other directions. There was to be a grand service, they said, with \"trumpets and shawms\" and the big drum, and the old Bishop preaching, making, in all probability, his very last public appearance. Up from the dark mysteries of Seatown, down from the...", "...of the line which were hanging on the walls, and then went away. CHAPTER II. THE EMBARKATION. The time fixed for the sailing of the steamer was on Tuesday morning; and Mr. George, in order to have time to communicate with some of the gentlemen to whose care he intended to intrust the two children, planned his journey to New York so as to arrive there in good season on Monday. He supposed that he should be able, without any difficulty, to find one or the other of them <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> or evening of that day. \"And if worst comes to the worst,\" added he to himself, in his reflections on the subject, \"I can certainly find them at the ship, by going on board an hour or two before she sails, and watching the plank as the passengers come up from the pier.\" Worst did come to the worst, it seems; for when Mr. George came home at nine o'clock in the evening, on Monday, and Rollo came up to him very eagerly in the parlor of the boarding house, to ask him...", "...as a man can ride, and are sure to lose no time. They would take the Leon road for some distance, then strike off and cross the upper Esla at Maylorga, follow the road down, avoiding Benavente, cross the Tera at Vega, take the track across the mountains, and come down into the valley from above. He said that he should only bring such stores as they would be able to carry on the march, and that he hoped to get here before the French were aware that he had left the mountains.\" Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Leon's followers arrived. They had travelled at night, so as to avoid being questioned by the French cavalry, who were scattered all over the country. Ryan was glad to see the men who had risked so much for him, and very pleased to be able to exchange his peasant's clothes for his uniform. The next morning, he and Leon mounted and rode by the track by which Terence would arrive, and met him halfway between Vega and the camp. The greeting was a hearty one, indeed and,...", "...and sprang upon his horse. \"We'll be likely to find need for it afore we reach the fort.\" This prediction was verified. As they rode along they constantly came upon bodies of men and women, whose horses had given out, or who had been shot while fleeing for life. In every case the poor fugitives had been scalped and mutilated. They were gathered up and tenderly buried, with no headstone to mark their remains, there to sleep until the last trump shall sound. Fort Severn was reached <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the second day. There were found, just six men and two women, the fleetness of whose steeds had enabled them to win in the race for life. All the others had fallen, among them Caleb Barnwell, the leader of the Quixotic scheme, and the founder of the town which died with him. The valley of the Rio Pecos was not prepared for any settlement unless one organized upon a scale calculated to overawe all combinations of the Apaches, Commanches, and Kiowas. From Fort...", "...the column had taken 52 rifles, 78 bandoliers, 2,500 rounds of ammunition, 105 horses, 96 saddles, 130 blankets, 25 cloaks and 8 bags of wheat. One shadow however fell upon the day. One of the Boers taken was in a complete suit of Khaki, regimental badges, slouch hat and all. Too many British had been killed, deceived by a British uniform upon a Boer, for it to be possible to be lenient: and he was accordingly tried by Court Martial, and shot in the evening. Companies were sent out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to search adjoining hills and kloofs; no Boers however had remained within reach. In the afternoon the explosion of Mauser cartridges which were being destroyed by burning sounded to those who had not been warned like a counter-attack, and caused a momentary sensation. It was thought very probable that the Boers would rally and try to take their revenge, and with the first light of Christmas morning the column stood to arms, and waited. Nothing occurred, however,...", "...our turning. Finally, colder than we had ever been before, we reached the Chateau at Gueschart. There we found a charming and hospitable son of the house and a pleasantly adoring lad. With their aid we piled the floor of the harness-room with straw, and those of us who were not on duty slept finely. From the dawn of the next morning we were working at top pressure right through the day, keeping in touch with the brigades which were billeted in villages several miles distant. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we discovered we were very short of petrol, so I was sent off to Crecy in our famous captured car, with a requisition. We arrived amidst cheers. I strode into the nearest garage and demanded 100 litres of petrol. It was humbly brought and placed in the car: then I sent boys flying round the town for jam and bread and butter, and in the meantime we entertained the crowd by showing them a German helmet. I explained volubly that my bandaged fingers--there was an affair of...", "...to tell,\" continued the officer. \"You have scared them half out of their wits,\" replied the ferryman, trying to smile. \"It isn't likely we can find out anything here,\" said the constable. \"If he has got the money, he has hid it round the house somewhere.\" Adopting this suggestion, the officers, followed by Mr. Randall, left the cottage to examine the vicinity. The constable was a shrewd man, and for a country locality, quite distinguished as a thief-taker. The shower early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> had left the ground in condition to receive the tracks of every individual who had been near the ferry. The sharp officer examined all the marks in the earth, and finally followed the footsteps of John Wilford, through a corn-field, above the cottage. Mrs. Wilford and Lawry wept as though their hearts would break, while the ferryman, trembling with apprehension, paced the kitchen. \"What are you crying for?\" said he impatiently. \"Oh, John!\" sobbed his wife....", "...to the suggestion of a mortal disease. It did not take Isaac long to find out that this complexion did not indicate consumption, but was only prison pallor. The other prisoner was less pathetic as to color, but he was listless and discouraged. The only amusement of these men consisted in chewing tobacco in enormous quantities, playing surreptitious games of high-low-jack, in reading the daily paper, a single magazine, and waiting for the sun to enter the barred window, and watching it <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> as it slipped away. These two men tried to cheer the new comer in a rude, hearty way; but when the country lad learned that they had been in detention for six months already, held by the government as main witnesses against the first mate of their brig, their words were as dust. They only choked him. \"What did you do,\" Isaac asked, \"to get you in such a scrape?\" \"We saw the mate shoot the cook; that's all.\" \"If I'd known,\" said the pale boy, with, a look out of...", "...\"that I have a cause of my own to plead.\" \"If he should talk of me--favorably,\" Eugenia continued, \"warn him against dangerous illusions.

To you I will say, Accept him outright.\" She had advanced to the open door-way, and she stood looking at him. \"I will go and dress and think of it,\" she said; and he heard her moving slowly to her apartments. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the rain stopped, and just afterwards there was a great flaming, flickering, trickling sunset. Felix sat in his painting-room and did some work; but at last, as the light, which had not been brilliant, began to fade, he laid down his brushes and came out to the little piazza of the cottage. Here he walked up and down for some time, looking at the splendid blaze of the western sky and saying, as he had often said before, that this was certainly the country of sunsets....", "...Walden, for instance--one might suppose that is was called, originally, _Walled-in_ Pond. The pond was my well ready dug. For four months in the year its water is as cold as it is pure at all times; and I think that it is then as good as any, if not the best, in the town.

Relieved of his alarm, Philip no longer hesitated, but, with his red felt cloak wrapped closely about him and a broad beaver slouched over his eyes, manfully pushed forward, in spite of the tempest. As he advanced, his retinue received continual accessions from the neighboring gentry and yeomanry, until it amounted to some thousands before he reached Winchester. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the cavalcade, soiled with travel and thoroughly drenched with rain, arrived before the gates of the city. The mayor and aldermen, dressed in their robes of scarlet, came to welcome the prince, and, presenting the keys of the city, conducted him to his quarters.

The way was through a field, an orchard, a narrow glen, shadowy with rocks and trees, down to the shore, where the sea runs in between the island and the mainland.

The only cadets who looked at all fresh were the members of the guard, who were excused from the day's drills. Yet for these returning ones, late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of a hot day, there was no immediate rest. Some of the cadets came back in service clothes, others in khaki, still others in field costume of campaign hat, flannel shirt, gray trousers and leggins. Immediately the young men in all these varieties of uniform disappeared within their tents. There was a subdued sound of great bustle. Then, almost in the same instant, it seemed, cadets stepped from the various tents into the open.

Fire in the breaker! Oh, the boys! the poor boys!\" These cries, and many like them--wild, heartrending, and full of fear--were heard on all sides. They served to empty the houses, and the one street of the little mining village of Raven Brook was quickly filled with excited people. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of a hot summer's day, and the white-faced miners of the night shift were just leaving their homes. Some of them, with lunch-pails and water-cans slung over their shoulders by light iron chains, were gathered about the mouth of the slope, prepared to descend into the dark underground depths where they toiled. The wives of the day shift men, some of whom, black as negroes with coal-dust, powder-smoke, and soot, had already been drawn up the long slope, were busy...", "...which the chief consulted, declared that the time of their departure was very inauspicious. According to the chief's own arrangement, the people of the Landers were to embark in the leaky canoe, with the heaviest of the luggage, and themselves were to travel in one of the chief's canoes, and to take along with them whatever was of most consequence. To this regulation they could not raise any plausible objection, because their old canoe had been partially repaired. A little after four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 4th November, their luggage was conveyed to the river side, and they proceeded to load the canoes. Long before five, every thing on their parts had been got in readiness for quitting the town, and they sat in the canoe till after sunset, waiting the arrival of the boatmen, who did not seem at all disposed to hurry themselves in making their appearance. They began at length to be wearied with anxiety, and impatient to be stirring. Hundreds of people had been...", "...and the regulars under Major Coolidge, who drove the enemy from this position.

Now we began to breathe a little more freely. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we ventured on a short walk to see our neighbours. There were several wigwams all belonging to our own people. They were not conical, but had, generally, rounded roofs, over which were placed large sheets of birch-bark and Indian matting. The people were very busy at work, the men drawing out saw-logs with two or three yoke of oxen; the women very busy with the birch-bark or basket-making. We found the Chief's wife sitting in a very airy apartment, there being...", "...aim, which was to make the time pass as pleasantly as possible. During the remainder of that day we talked of all that had occurred since Commodore Barney left Pig Point, and speculated upon the result of an attack upon Baltimore. That night we turned in without standing watch, and next morning came a light, drizzling rain which forced us to keep under cover unless we were willing to toddle around on the wet decks, which was not particularly cheerful amusement. By three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we had talked until our tongues were tired, and every topic of conversation was exhausted. Then we fell silent, with none too pleasing thoughts for company, until Darius sprang to his feet with an exclamation that aroused us all. \"What bloomin' idjuts we are to think we must needs wait here till the Britishers come down the river!\" he cried excitedly. \"I thought it was settled that we couldn't well do anything else,\" Captain Hanaford said in mild surprise. \"So...", "...only too happy to have you if you'd come--any time, sooner or later. But I don't think you will.\" \"No,\" I answered, \"I shall not. I have made other plans. I am going to leave Denboro.\" That did not seem to surprise them and I was still more puzzled. They shook hands and went away, promising to call at the house that evening and bring Nellie. \"She wants to thank you, too, Ros,\" said George. After they had gone I sat by the big door, looking out at the bay, smooth and beautiful <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sunlight, and thinking of what they had told me. For Mother's sake I was very glad. It would be easier for her, after I had gone; the townspeople would be friendly, instead of disagreeable. For her sake, I was glad.

Indeed, events had occurred in such a manner as to make her responsibility seem natural and inevitable, to give it the sanction of the most correct convention. Between 4.30 and 6 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> four separate calls of inquiry had been made at the house, thus demonstrating Mrs. Maldon's status in the town. One lady had left a fine bunch of grapes.

Here we managed with extreme difficulty and great peril to get again out of the shallows aforesaid, into which we had sailed as into a trap, between them and the land, for which happy deliverance God be praised; the shallows extend South and North, from 4 to 9 miles from the mainland, and are 10 miles in length from East to West....", "...from Salvolio, that Kara thought my dungeon was too warm. It was sheltered from the winds by the hill behind and even on the coldest days and nights it was not unbearable. Then Kara went away for some time. I think he must have gone to England, and he came back in a white fury. One of his big plans had gone wrong and the mental torture he inflicted upon me was more acute than ever. \"In the old days he used to come once a week; now he came almost every day. He usually arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and I was surprised one night to be awakened from my sleep to see him standing at the door, a lantern in his hand, his inevitable cigarette in his mouth. He always wore the Albanian costume when he was in the country, those white kilted skirts and zouave jackets which the hillsmen affect and, if anything, it added to his demoniacal appearance. He put down the lantern and leant against the wall. \"'I'm afraid that wife of yours is breaking up, Lexman,' he drawled;...", "...and got the guns away, losing men, but no animals. Meanwhile from the Median Wall the 'Tigers'[10] watched the fight. One could not help being reminded of the grand-stand at a football match. Sitting on the further side and below the crest, the officers watched the Indians pushing over the plain steadily through heavy shelling. We saw dreadful pounding away on our left, where 5.9's plunged and burst among the trenches the Seaforths were holding. Yet even a battle grows monotonous; so <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we went down to the trenches before the wall to rest, so far as heat and flies would permit. In that period of slackness a number of men swarmed up the wall. Instead of sitting where we had done, they sat on the crest, against the sky-line. Hitherto the shrapnel had not come nearer than a ridge four hundred yards away, which had been often and well peppered. But now came the hateful whistle, and the ridge was swept from end to end with both H.E. and shrapnel.

And thus the good work went on all day long, the Senator and the Englishmen only having a few minutes to snatch a bite to eat and tap fresh bottles.

Every critter had traveled thirty miles that day, and lots of them began to drop out and lay down. In one of the herds was an old yellow steer. He was bobtailed, lophorned and had a game leg, and for the fifteenth time he limped by the crowd that was counting.

However, extremes are not likely to make good fishing, and the trout will not rise as freely on cold, windy days, nor will they fight as gamely. On hot days, too, not so much luck can be expected during the hours of the greatest heat--12 to 4--but a good basket of trout may be creeled early in the morning or late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of summer.

The church is curious and interesting; it is ornamented with representations of saints, and holy men in fresco, upon the walls of the interior and in the porch. I could not make...", "...my mind, I went to bed. 28th. I observe that Will, whom I used to call two or three times in a morning, would now wake of himself and rise without calling. Which though angry I was glad to see. So I rose and among my workmen, in my gown, without a doublet, an hour or two or more, till I was afraid of getting an ague, and so to the office, and there we sat all the morning, and at noon Mr. Coventry and I dined at Sir W. Batten's, where I have now dined three days together, and so <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> again we sat, which we intend to do two afternoons in a week besides our other sitting. In the evening we rose, and I to see how my work goes on, and so to my office, writing by the post and doing other matters, and so home and to bed late. 29th.

It was over 20 feet in height (I could not manage to measure it quite to the top); the middle part had fallen in, probably from pressure of the ice, while the remaining part formed a magnificent triumphal arch of the whitest marble, on which the sun glittered with all its brilliancy. Was it erected to celebrate my defeat? I got up on it to look out for the Fram, but had to go some distance yet before I could see her rigging over the horizon. It was not till half-past five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that I found myself on board again, worn out and famished from this sudden and unexpected excursion. After a day's fasting I heartily relished a good meal. During my absence some of the others had started after me with a sledge to draw home the dead bears that I had shot; but they had barely reached the spot where the encounter had taken place, when Johansen and Blessing, who were in advance of the others, saw two fresh bears spring up from behind a hummock a little...", "...by; that the daughter refused to accept my caresses, and that the mother said to me,-- \"My daughter is yet a virgin, and she is quite right not to lose her maidenhood without making a good profit by it.\" \"If so,\" I answered, \"I will give you ten sequins for her virginity.\" \"You may judge for yourself,\" said the mother. Having assured myself of the fact by the assistance of the sense of feeling, and having ascertained that it might be true, I told the mother to bring the girl <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to the Zuecca, and that I would give her the ten sequins. My offer was joyfully accepted, the mother brought her daughter to me, she received the money, and leaving us together in the Garden of the Cross, she went away. When I tried to avail myself of the right for which I had paid, the girl, most likely trained to the business by her mother, contrived to prevent me. At first the game amused me, but at last, being tired of it, I told her to have done. She answered...", "...out of a crack in the rock, and a few yards above water level.

All the serviceable animals captured were added to our cavalcade, and the prisoners paroled and sent on their way rejoicing. The river was crossed on a one-horse platform ferry-boat, whose capacity was only twenty horses and their riders. Considerable precious time was consumed in this tedious operation. When the last man had reached the desired shore, the ferry-boat was destroyed, and the column resumed its line of march. About four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a cold rain-storm set in, borne on the flapping wings of a chilly wind.

From half-past six in the morning till live <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the air is filled with mosquitos. An hour before sunset a species of small gnats--called tempraneros, because they appear also at sunrise--take the place of the mosquitos. Their presence scarcely lasts an hour and a half.

I had now seen nearly all the sights, and as I had been absent from home four days, I began to bend my thoughts that way; but the reflection that I had left my father, not only without his leave, but also against his consent, now began to render every thing that others appeared to enjoy very irksome to me. I, however, mustered courage, took my horse, and reached home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the fifth day. At the door I met my father, who received me in the most hostile manner. He lavished his imprecations upon my head, and as he burst out of the room, he, in a paroxysm of passion, ordered me to quit his house, and see his face no more. Springing by me in a menacing manner, he repeated his denunciations, declaring that I should not remain under his roof. He then went to the stable, took his horse, which I had just brought home, mounted it, and rode away...", "...house, and would feel at home there. When Captain Sanker and his wife (if you have not forgotten them) first came to Worcester, they stayed at Lake's while fixing on a residence, and that's how we became tolerably well acquainted with the Lakes. This year that I am now writing about was the one that preceded the accident to King Sanker, told of earlier in the volume. And, in point of rotation, this paper ought to have appeared first. So I went with Dr. Lewis and Anne. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when we reached Worcester, close upon the dinner-hour--which was five o'clock, and looked upon as quite a fashionable hour in those days. The dinner-bell had rung, and the company had filed in to dinner when we got downstairs. But there was not much company staying in the house. Mrs. Lake did not appear at dinner, and Miss Dinah Lake took the head of the table. It happened more often than not that Mrs. Lake was in the kitchen, superintending the dinner and seeing to...", "...to join the Colorado.

We land quickly in a cove out of sight, and away go all the hunters with their guns, for the sheep have not discovered us. Soon we hear firing, and those of us who have remained in the boats climb up to see what success the hunters have had.

A few hours' penmanship is certainly fatal to one's putting, and typewriting is worse.

And oh, that my best golfing enemy would buy a motor-cycle! A player once told me that he could not putt <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> after having found it necessary to beat his dog at lunch-time; and it has been observed to be quite a bad thing for one's putting to use a walking-stick in one's ordinary pedestrianism.

They marched up the deep cut of projected railway, where, for a time, they were shaded from the sun by the high banks. But, emerging presently on the Warrenton pike, they saw evidences that other columns--whether friends or foes they couldn't tell--had recently preceded them.

Delightful as it had been <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sunlight, it seemed to Jack more delightful still in the dusk of this beautiful September evening. The moon was just rising, throwing pale shafts of light through the trees, deepening the shadows.

After that, there was nothing for it but retreat; and he reluctantly broke camp and left the valley, meaning to return when he could. Two years elapsed and the opportunity still tarried; but Garvin kept the shut-in valley in mind, and it was thitherward he turned his face when Stephen Elliott's liberal \"grub-stake,\" and the hastily formed partnership with Jeffard, provided the means and the help necessary to sink a shaft. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of a cloudless August day that Jeffard had his first glimpse of the park-like valley lying in the lap of the sentinel mountains. The air was crisp and thin-edged with the keen breath of the altitudes, but the untempered heat of the sun beat pitilessly upon the heads of the two men picking their laborious way over the rock-ribbed shoulder of the least precipitous mountain. \"Well, pardner, we've riz the last o' the hills,\" quoth Garvin, stepping aside to let the burro,...", "...to go home, Jacob used to escort her to her cottage on the river bank, about a mile distant from his own residence, and after a few weeks there sprang up an intimacy between them which culminated in the incidents which gave rise to my narrative.

He was greatly pleased with the baby, and took it up fondly in his arms, and on leaving placed a roll of bank bills in my hand, telling me to get everything necessary for either the mother or her child, also to get the latter whatever clothing it might require. After that he called almost daily, and when Mrs. Trotter was sufficiently recovered to return to her home, he pressed me so strongly to keep the baby till it was a little older, and not to...", "...were on fire to drive the Yankees away from it once more. We marched fast. We were the foot cavalry, just as we used to be; and, do you know, that Cajun band was along with our brigade, as lively as ever. The Yankees had heard of our coming, but late. They had already built forts around Winchester, but they didn't dream until the last moment that a big force from Lee's army was at hand. Their biggest fort was on Applepie Ridge, some little distance from Winchester. We came up late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and had to rest a while, as it was awful hot. Then we opened, with General Ewell himself in direct command there. Old Jube Early had gone around to attack their other works, and we were waiting to hear the roaring of his guns. \"We gave it to 'em hot and heavy.

The detachment approached the fort without any resistance from the Germans, and, surrounding it, discovered that there was a small garrison, which had barred itself inside.

The capture of this fort was the key for the final attack of the Japanese, as it left the central fort and redoubts exposed to fire. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the fire became extremely heavy. The Germans seemed to be making sharp resistance to the Japanese, lest they advance within the quarter-mile zone of the redoubt walls. The Japanese infantry, however, were sapping away, and as dusk settled over the field we saw the bright flash of bursting shrapnel from the German forts. It was the first shrapnel sent out by the Germans during the siege. Ten, twelve, fifteen, and sometimes even twenty shrapnel shells could be counted...", "...it.

Was it all a dream?\" the child asked himself sadly. Sunday came round again, and Gratian set off to church with his father and mother. Going to church was one of his pleasures--of late especially, for the owner of the Big House, though seldom there himself, was generous and rich, and he had spent money in restoring the church and giving a beautiful organ. And on Sunday mornings an organist came from a distance to play on it, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> its great voice was silent, for no one in the village--not even the schoolmaster, who was supposed to know most things--knew how to play on it. For this reason Gratian never cared to go to church the second time--he would much rather have stayed out on the moor with Jonas and Watch, and sometimes, in the fine summer weather, when the walk was hot and tiring even for big people, his mother had allowed him to do so.

This rumour reached the King's Council, and Cardinal Wolsey sent for the Mayor, to ask him what he knew of it; upon which the Mayor told him that peace should be kept. The Cardinal told him to take pains that it should be.

Then the appetite following long hours of travel, the joy of the exercise, and wonder of the sights that we see--strange men, fierce animals, impenetrable forests, and lands where the beasts of the field are rulers and man is of no importance at all. \"What is there here to take the place of that life? In the morning I stand on one leg, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I stand on the other. I put my head in the mud, or at the far end of my back, or under my wing, or round my foot. I make an attempt to twist my neck on a new and original pattern, and I listen to the ill-informed chatter of my European and American cousins, and the strange folk who come here to see us. And I'd give all the food that serves me for three days for three hours' wading, or swimming, or flying in my own far country, under a sky that is really warm. Doubtless...", "...her back to us. I said to myself, that if I could ever do anything for him or his, I would certainly do it, for my--for this lovely young creature's sake.

When I went out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> for my usual stroll,--or rather when I returned from that stroll,--I saw once more before me the woman with her baby, whose story had filled me with dismay on the previous evening. She was waiting at the gate as before, and, \"Oh, gentleman, but haven't you got some news to give me?\" she said. \"My good woman,--I--have been greatly occupied. I have had--no time to do anything.\" \"Ah!\" she said, with a little cry of disappointment, \"my man said not to make too sure,...", "...at Peter Sadler and then at Mr. Archibald, who was leaning back in his chair, his bright eyes twinkling. \"How did you find out all that about him?\" he asked. \"Humph!\" exclaimed Peter Sadler. \"Don't you suppose I can read a man's character when I've had a good chance at him? Now how about the stores--have they all gone on?\" \"They were sent out early this mornin',\" said Matlack, \"and we can start as soon as the folks are ready.\" CHAPTER V CAMP ROB It was early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the Archibald party took up the line of march for Camp Rob. The two ladies, supplied by Mrs. Sadler with coarse riding-skirts, sat each upon a farm-horse, and Mr. Archibald held the bridle of the one that carried his wife. Matlack and Martin Sanders, the young man who was to assist him, led the way, while a led horse, loaded with the personal baggage of the travellers, brought up the rear. Their way wound through a forest over a wood road, very rough and barely...", "...Hipper formed his line ahead on the same general course and approached for a running fight. He opened fire at 5.49 o'clock in the afternoon with heavy artillery at a range of 13,000 meters against the superior enemy. The weather was clear and light, and the sea was light with a northwest wind. After about a quarter of an hour a violent explosion occurred on the last cruiser of the Indefatigable type. It was caused by a heavy shell, and destroyed the vessel. About 6.20 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> five warships of the Queen Elizabeth type came from the west and joined the British battle cruiser line, powerfully reinforcing with their fifteen-inch guns the five British battle cruisers remaining after 6.20 o'clock. To equalize this superiority Vice Admiral Hipper ordered the destroyers to attack the enemy. The British destroyers and small cruisers interposed, and a bitter engagement at close range ensued, in the course of which a light cruiser...", "...is dry work, Mr. Germaine.

Nevertheless, finding no solution of the mystery on board the ship, and the weather at the time being fine, the captain determined, while the daylight lasted, to alter his course, and see what came of it. Toward three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> an iceberg came of it; with a wrecked ship stove in, and frozen fast to the ice; and the passengers and crew nigh to death with cold and exhaustion. Wonderful enough, you will say; but more remains behind.

But Jesus answered the scribe warmly. \"You are not far from the Kingdom of God!\" Andrew came through the crowd toward Peter. \"Have you seen Judas?\" \"We were talking just a minute ago.\" Both the men searched among the people. \"He must have gone!\" The fishermen were puzzled. \"He did not want the officials to see him with us,\" remarked Peter. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the people began to leave the Temple court. The disciples became anxious. With hardly anyone around, the Romans could easily arrest Jesus! In a few more minutes there would be almost no one in the Temple. But still Jesus talked to a few persons who needed him. When they left the men sighed with relief. \"Where is Judas?\" asked Jesus. Not one of the disciples knew. * * * * * Judas had not left the Temple, as Peter supposed. At that very...", "...freak of the imagination. So insistent did it at last become that I returned to the house and hastily scribbled a note, stating what I had heard--or, rather, thought I had heard--and expressing the hope that all was well.

When I paused, the Frau Directorin asked me how it was possible to serve so lavish a bill of fare for so little money, and the Herr Director asked the waiter why they called this a Long Island duck when the portions were so short. Thus the conviction was forced upon me that our environment was not conducive to the discussion of the American Spirit and that I must await a more auspicious occasion. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that occasion came; not on Fifth Avenue but on one of those streets where churches are fewest and humanity thickest; where Sunday brings liberation from toil, where cleanliness and godliness have an equally difficult task in coming or abiding; where nations and races must mingle and cannot easily blend, where the America which is to be is in the making, and where the Spirit must manifest itself if we are to be a nation with common ideals.

And I slept better that night because I knew that my birds were comfortable. \"'They may go in once, but you will never catch them so again,' said my father, when he heard about it. I had an idea, however, that the birds trusted me; for though they flew out very gladly the next morning, they did not seem afraid. \"Sure enough, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they came back again!

During the rest of that day Philip saw but little of Josephine, and he made no effort to intrude himself upon her.

The Camp is situated about seven miles from Pembroke. The Ottawa river is at this point a beautiful lake. Immediately opposite the Camp is a little summer hotel of the simplest description. It was at this hotel that my wife, my daughter, and myself stayed in the early days of July, 1916. The hotel was full of the wives of the officers stationed in the Camp. During the daytime I was the only man among the guests. About five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the officers from the Camp began to arrive on a primitive motor ferryboat. My son came over each day, and we often visited him at the Camp. His long training at Kingston had been very severe. It included besides the various classes which he attended a great deal of hard exercise, long rides or foot marches over frozen roads before breakfast, and so forth. After this strenuous winter the Camp at Petewawa was a delightful change. His tent stood on a bluff, commanding an...", "...20 minutes, and at 8 o'clock he conducted a Bible reading in the Chart Room. On Sunday morning, June 6th, he preached in the saloon, and every day had a Bible reading with the passengers.

Periodically, the trader came down to Kimberley with his waggons and outfit, after a year or two spent in the distant interior. Yesterday morning he had come in, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and evening he seemed to hear upon men's tongues nothing else than Frank Farnborough's case, and the story of the Mahalapsi diamond.

Some of the gunboats were to run the batteries, get above the fort and above the village of Dover. I had ordered a reconnoissance made with the view of getting troops to the river above Dover in case they should be needed there.

Their behaviour all day was docile, not to say lamb-like, and it was not until evening that the new skipper found it necessary to enforce his authority. The exciting cause of the unpleasantness was Mr. William Green, a slim, furtive-eyed young man, whom Fraser took on <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to fill the vacancy caused by Ben's promotion.

Colonel Morgan chose Captain Huffman, who, with thirty of his famous Texan rangers, was soon galloping to the scene of the encounter, under the guidance of the courier who had brought the news. On the way they met Calhoun's little squad sorrowfully returning. Not a man but begged to be allowed to go with the rescuing party, but this, on account of the tired condition of their horses, and on account of the two wounded men, had to be refused. It was well along <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the theatre of the encounter was reached. Captain Huffman had with him three or four men who for years had been accustomed to Indian fighting in Texas; these men took up the trail and followed it like bloodhounds.

Almost everything else valuable was saved; and not a dozen men lost in the retreat.

The enemy however from fear or other reasons indulged with the opportunity of two nights to carry off all except some heavy cannon. The garrison was drawn off <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> after our retreat under the fire of the shipping who are now drawn up just behind [late] Govrs Island, and the fire of some cannon from Long Island shore; but with no other loss than that of one man's arm. What our loss on Long Island was I am not able to estimate.

Owing to the loss of a hatchet in driving the stakes, only one net had been set the preceding evening, and in it we took eight carp. The raft being made of green wood was not sufficiently buoyant, and a new one was, therefore, constructed this day of dried timber. The carp afforded a breakfast for the party, and supper consumed all our deer's meat, together with a portion of the remainder of the pemmican.

Shortly before 5 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> despatches began to come in. Of course a slight delay was unavoidable, as the observers at the various stations were some rods distant from the local telegraph offices, and it would take a few minutes after the eclipse was over to prepare the suitable message from the cypher code. On the astronomer's table in the _Herald_ office were a large map and a chronometer. The latter indicated exact Greenwich time, and the former showed the correct position of the Moon's shadow...", "...Plans. It is said that on the top of these hills springs of water rise to the surface, though there is no higher ground in the neighbourhood; a phenomenon which has been accounted for by the supposition of a difference of specific gravity between these springs and the waters which drive them up.

We only skirted this rock in the first instance, and made for a clump of trees some little way off, in which we found a deep pit, with a path of sufficient steepness leading to the bottom. Here we came to a collection of snow, much sheltered by overhanging rocks and trees; and this, our guide told us, was the _neigiere_, a word evidently formed on the same principle as _glaciere_. The snow was half-covered with leaves, and was unpleasantly wet to our feet, so that...", "...town's signs. Here and there we see where the Salinas River has eaten great pieces out of its banks, during the spring freshets. We had seen the same thing in Carmel Valley, where a man lost a large piece of his orchard by its falling bodily into the raging Carmel river.

They are shallow streams with earth banks, but in the time of the spring rains they become wild torrents.

It looks like a picture town, its buildings taking on castle-like proportions from a distance. We then come over the Jolon Grade, and descend through a little wooded valley that has a particular charm. I do not know its name, but it cast a certain spell that lingers with me. It is a narrow valley with stretches of thick green grass under forest trees, and has a quality of...", "...sigh. For the better part of the day we roamed in and out through the tangled city. In the confusion of donkeys, bare legs, and immodesty, the narcotic smell of hashish, the sound of the harsh guttural tongue once so familiar, memories of more distant Mohammedan lands surged upon me. Yet by comparison Tangiers seemed only a faded segment of the swarming Arab world set aside to overawe European tourists, Arabic enough in its way, but only a little, mild-mannered sample.

One day deliveries crowded in so fast that three cashiers working in the \"cage\" were unable to keep up with the transactions. The business of the corporation had been heavy in the general list as well as in the house specialties.

Again the keen-eyed birds of the air spotted them, flashed their range back to their heaviest mouthpieces, and for the better part of the day the entire batteries of their heaviest caliber, expended their energies and their shells on the dummies; there was no kind or character of explosive shell that did not land on the frauds. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> two of the air birds wanted to get down a little closer, undoubtedly to satisfy themselves as to how the work of destruction had progressed, and one of our little observation planes gave battle to the visitors, engaging the nearest one first. His companion bird made for ours, but before he could get underneath to do anything, the first German bird had been winged and downed. Our anti-aircraft guns now made it so warm for the other bird that he beat it. The visit,...", "...\"Besides all of us can swim.

The sole occupant was paddling with...", "...where he sat, but showed a strong disinclination to being returned to his countrymen! He had the philosophy to believe that he was old and helpless,--a child for the second time,--and that by dying he was but performing his duty to society! To be placed again in a position where he would be an incumbrance to those whom he could not call kindred was, in his opinion, a crime he should not commit! Our adventurers resolved upon saving him in spite of himself. It was not until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that they reached the kraal from which the outcasts had been ejected. Not a soul could be found in the whole community who would admit that the old man had ever been seen there before, and no one had the slightest knowledge of the child!

As soon as a royal child, which they call here un Enfant de France, is born, and has been swaddled, they put on him a grand cordon; but they do not create him a knight of the order until he has communicated; the ceremony is then performed in the ordinary manner. The ladies of chancellors here have the privilege of the tabouret when they come to the toilette; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they are obliged to stand. This practice began in the days of Marie de Medicis, when a chancellor's wife happened to be in great favour. As she had a lame foot and could not stand up, the Queen, who would have her come to visit her every morning, allowed her to sit down. From this time the custom of these ladies sitting in the morning has been continued.

When he turned round to go on with the work the aide had fled and never appeared again. I met Dr. Churchin. He is one of the best Serbs I have yet met, a philosopher. He was looking after the English units in Kragujevatz and I learnt did it excellently, and with a devotion to his duties altogether unusual. He told me that I had been nominated an honorary captain; but I am under the impression that it is an honour I cannot by national law accept. We went <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in the car towards Rudnik to examine the one which had broken down. I soon saw that nothing could be done on the spot, and ordered it to continue its \"bullocky\" progress to the camp.

It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when we got there, and we spent the remainder of the day and evening in recounting our summer's experience for Uncle Kit's benefit, who was a very interested listener to all that had befallen us since we parted from him in the spring.

On Sunday morning the city was practically snow-bound. Paul breakfasted late, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he fell in with a wild San Francisco boy, a freshman at Yale, who said he had run down for a \"little flyer\" over Sunday. The young man offered to show Paul the night side of the town, and the two boys went off together after dinner, not returning to the hotel until seven o'clock the next morning. They had started out in the confiding warmth of a champagne friendship, but their parting in the elevator was singularly cool. The freshman pulled himself together to make his...", "...required the utmost exertion. On other days it was easy enough, and Pelle could tell it best by the feeling. At certain times of the day there were signs at home on the farm that told him the time, and the cattle gave him other hours by their habits. At nine the first one lay down to chew the morning cud, and then all gradually lay down one by one; and there was always a moment at about ten when they all lay chewing. At eleven the last of them were upon their legs again. It was the same <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> between three and five. Midday was easy to determine when the sun was shining. Pelle could always feel it when it turned in its path. And there were a hundred other things in nature that gave him a connection with the times of day, such as the habits of the birds, and something about the fir-trees, and much besides that he could not lay his finger upon and say it was there, because it was only a feeling. The time to drive home was given by the cattle themselves. When...", "...Another familiar sound of the mountains was the shrill whistle of the mountain woodchuck, called from its cry, \"whistler.\" It could not have been so very long since these animals came out from their winter homes, but they were now abroad and in full voice, and each one as he saw the train, or indeed as he saw any other unusual object, gave vent to his shrill cry. Altogether, the day's journey, while it lacked any especial incident, was one of very great pleasure to Jack. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they camped in a beautiful opening surrounded by giant spruces and firs, where rich grass stood waist high, and the steep sides of the mountains rose sharply from the narrow valley. After camp had been made and supper eaten, Hugh said to Jack, \"Now, son. I'm going up the creek a little way to see if I can see any sign of beaver or other fur. What are you going to do?\" \"Well,\" said Jack, \"I don't know; I think I'll go up this little valley through which this side...", "...\"or chalishes, or the like of such Popish veshells of gold and silver, deil hae me an I conneve at their being removed.\" The sexton also stipulated, that our researches should take place at night, being unwilling to excite observation, or give rise to scandal.

We visited every corner of these magnificent ruins again and again during the forenoon; and, having made a comfortable dinner at David's, we walked <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to such places in the neighbourhood as ancient tradition or modern conjecture had rendered mark worthy. Night found us in the interior of the ruins, attended by the sexton, who carried a dark lantern, and stumbling alternately over the graves of the dead, and the fragments of that architecture, which they doubtless trusted would have canopied their bones till doomsday. I am by no means particularly superstitious, and yet there was that in the present service which I...", "...out of the greatest danger. The Indians slept late the morning after the feast. When they waked at last, they came out of their huts one by one, and went toward the French house. They were surprised to see it shut up, and everything silent about it. They supposed that the French were at prayer, so they waited quietly outside. They could hear the fowls crowing in the yard, and when they knocked at the door of the house, the dog barked. Noon came, and yet no Frenchmen appeared. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the Indians climbed up the side of the house and got in by a window. They could hear no sound but their own steps. They were much frightened as they stole through the house and opened the main door. They searched the building from top to bottom, but not a Frenchman was to be found. As they were sure that the French had no boats, they were struck with fear. They gazed a moment at each other in silence. Then they fled from the house. They believed that the Frenchmen...", "...when I was in the vestry with the clergyman to confess my sins, after a formal manner, I defrauded him; for I handed over to him only the twelfth part of the fee which my father had given me for him. In this state of heart, without prayer, without true repentance, without faith, without knowledge of the plan of salvation, I was confirmed, and took the Lord's Supper, on the Sunday after Easter, 1820. Yet I was not without some feeling about the solemnity of the thing, and stayed at home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and evening, whilst the other boys and girls, who had been confirmed with me, walked about in the fields. My time till midsummer, 1821, was spent partly in study, but in a great degree in playing the piano-forte and guitar, reading novels, frequenting taverns, forming resolutions to become different, yet breaking them almost as fast as they were made.

After an hour's discussion, Mrs. Catlin left with the parting injunction, \"Call upon me for anything--I will be on hand.\" Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Mr. Talmage returned with his brother who was the editor of a prominent magazine in New York. The Blue Birds had gone, and Ruth welcomed her uncle whose visits were always a source of pleasure to Ned and herself. He sat down on the steps beside her and listened to her story of the wonderful work Ned's printing press had done that summer, and of the work required of it for the coming summer. Uncle Ben smiled as he listened. \"Ned will be walking in my footsteps...", "...felt suffocating with new hope, for what could be but good from Harold's meeting with that sweet woman who had already brought so much comfort into her own life?

It had been arranged that two days hence the Stonehouse party were to spend the day at Lannoy, coming before lunch and staying the night, as they wanted <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to return a visit at some distance to the north of Lannoy. Harold was to ride over with them. When the Varilands party arrived, Stephen told them of Sister Ruth's wish to see Harold. Pearl at once proffered a request that she also should be taken at some other time to see the Silver Lady. Harold acquiesced heartily; and it was agreed that some time in the late afternoon he should pay the visit. Stephen would bring him.

M. The first boom of artillery was heard at ten o'clock. Since then there has been almost a continuous roar. McCook's corps is in advance of us, perhaps a mile and a half, and, with divisions from other corps, has been gradually approaching the enemy all day, driving his skirmishers from one point to another. About four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the artillery firing became more vigorous, and, with Colonel Foreman, of the Fifteenth Kentucky, I rode to the front, and then along our advanced line from right to left. Our artillery stationed on the higher points was being fired rapidly. The skirmishers were advancing cautiously, and the contest between the two lines was quite exciting. As I supposed, our army is feeling its way into position.

There were moments when she had a wild desire to scream aloud, so tense had her nerves become with the strain put upon them.

She had not long to wait, she told herself, before knowing the truth. Until then, she must remain perfectly cool.

Captain Wooldbridge, viewing the eruption <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 26th from a distance of forty miles, speaks of a great vapour-cloud looking like an immense wall being momentarily lighted up \"by bursts of forked lightning like large serpents rushing through the air. After sunset this dark wall resembled a blood-red curtain, with edges of all shades of yellow, the whole of a murky tinge, through which gleamed fierce flashes of lightning.\" As Professor Judd observes, the abundant generation of atmospheric electricity is a...", "...start was made, and at 10 a.m. a halt and outspan ordered. At mid-day the officers commanding units were sent for, when the General informed them that a large force of Boers, under Steyn and De Wet, with women and children, 3000 strong, was reported in the neighbourhood of Klerksdorp. Rumour further said that they were so bewildered by our apparently aimless midnight movements that they neither knew where to go nor what to do. The General added that it was his intention to march again <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in their direction, to have another outspan at dusk, and then to march all night and surprise them next morning. The commanding officers looked at one another in blank amazement, for they knew better than the General could the effect these constant nights without sleep and days of fighting without food were having on their men, but there was nothing for it, and the General called upon his troops for one more supreme effort. At the same time he heliographed to Major...", "...the exact imitation they gave of the swagger of a certain white with whom they had been dealing, and who had, as they had perceived, evidently wished to assume an air of indifference. Holding up the head and scratching the beard it was hinted might indicate not indifference, but vermin. It is well that we do not always know what they say about us. The remarks are often not quite complimentary, and resemble closely what certain white travellers say about the blacks. We made our camp <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> abreast of the large island called Mparira, opposite the mouth of the Chobe. Francolins, quails, and guinea- fowls, as well as larger game, were abundant.

This honey is slightly...", "...be the extreme point on the western side of the bay. Immediately after we were on the edge of the Barrier, the direction of which was here south-west and north-east.

With this excellent mark in view the rest of the way was plain sailing. The sledge-meter showed 19.5 geographical miles, when <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we came in sight of our winter home.

Through the forested region of Crecy the British passed, and it has been told hereinbefore how they surprised the two cavalry commands thrust out as scouts by General von Kluck. But, as they reached the land that had been occupied by the German hosts, the bearing of the men changed, even as the country changed. The simple homes of the peasants were in ashes, every house that had showed traces of comfort had been sacked or gutted with fire. Between noon and three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of that day three burned churches were passed. The songs stopped. A black silence fell upon the ranks. Bloody business was afoot. It was in the middle of the afternoon, a slumbrous harvest afternoon, that a big gun boomed in the distance, and the shell shrieked dolefully through the air, its vicious whine ceasing with a tremendous sudden roar as it burst behind the advancing British lines. On the instant, Sir John French's batteries almost wiped out the German...", "...was better chance of doing their business in peace and quiet.\" The party now rode on, and without further interruption arrived at Ghent. They put up for the night at a hostelry, but in the morning the merchant had no difficulty in hiring the use of a house for a month, for many of the better class houses were standing empty. Then he called on several of the leading burgesses, some of whom were known to him personally, and had long and earnest talk with them upon the situation. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he sent a letter to Philip Van Artevelde, saying that he had just arrived from England, and would be glad to have a private parley with him. An answer was received from Van Artevelde saying that he would call that evening upon him, as it would be more easy to have quiet speech together there than if he visited him at his official residence. At eight o'clock Van Artevelde arrived. He was wrapped in a cloak, and gave no name, simply saying to the retainer who opened the...", "...before, and now again she held her own well. The ice was split against the strong stern, and lay shattered on both sides of the ship on a level with the edge of the half-deck all the way forward to the mizzen-shrouds. The ship now lay almost loose in her berth, and the ice round about was broken up into a mass of smaller floes. As these were passed down by the heavy drifts, it was hard work to get round the ship, as one ran the risk of plumping down into the slush at any moment.

I therefore went out in the \"pram\" to try to find a passage through to the channel on the southeast, but without result. After supper I was off...", "...Sedgwick, which, with Early's command, now in rear of the Federal column, would, it was supposed, suffice.

When the brigades sent by Lee joined him, the whole force formed line of battle: a brisk action ensued, continuing from about four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> until nightfall, when the fighting ceased, and General Sedgwick made no further attempt to advance on that day. These events took place, as we have said, on Sunday afternoon, the day of the Federal defeat at Chancellorsville. On Monday morning (May 4th), the theatre of action on the southern bank of the Rappahannock presented a very remarkable complication. General Early had been driven from the ridge at Fredericksburg; but no sooner had General Sedgwick marched...", "...or directly out of the bight, running at the rate of two miles and a half per hour. By noon, it being ascertained that there was not any inlet, they bore away to the Westward along the land. Their distance from the shore did not exceed a mile and a half.

The root idea of the Society, apart from its independence, was the mingling of the spiritual and the natural; the domestication of faith. With a view of making the idea more prevailing and complete, a children's service <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> was substituted for the regular Sunday-school. A book was prepared, \"The Child's Book of Religion,\" by the pastor, for this express purpose. There were responsive readings, recitations in unison, songs, and an address, simple and anecdotical, by the minister. The Society was never fashionable, or even popular. At one period--that of the Richardson-McFarland matter--there was a vast deal of misrepresentation, criticism, and abuse, but all this had no effect on the...", "...was taking her siesta in bed, but as I had the privileges allowed to a person of no consequence she let me in directly.

Nursey chuckled, but would n't give a hint, and went out again <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with a long list of more things to buy; while Effie wandered forlornly about the house, missing the usual merry stir that went before the Christmas dinner and the evening fun. As for mamma, she was quite invisible all day, and came in at night so tired that she could only lie on the sofa to rest, smiling as if some very pleasant thought made her happy in spite of weariness. \"Is the surprise going on all right?\" asked Effie, anxiously; for it seemed an immense time...", "...himself this morning in gray flannel, with a reach-me-down overcoat, cloth cap, and carpet slippers that betrayed his flat, Jewish instep.

(It had blown more than half a gale, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> three heavy seas had come aboard. The third officer at this moment was employed with half a dozen seamen in repairing damages.) 'I was watching. As I judged, it was the nicest miss you weren't overboard.

The next night they came home to the house together. The girl had protested at the idea of a wedding trip. \"We both like that hill farm better than anywhere else in the world,\" she said. \"Why should we go racing off to some place we don't care about?\" \"And defy an old custom like that?\" he argued; but he knew that she knew how much he had wanted exactly that. So they had gone to the church <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and had come back to a reception at the aunt's afterwards--a very nice affair with the luxurious old rooms candle-lighted and hung with autumn leaves. And their best friends had come to wish them well, with all the noise and chatter common to such occasions, even among very well bred people; and as soon as they could, they kissed the aunt and slipped away, getting a last glimpse of Jean and the Agricultural Representative, apparently completely lost in some panorama...", "...between the way she an' Jabez acted an' the way they used to. I've heard preachers beseech their victims to live in peace an' harmony together, an' not to quarrel or complain; an' right at the time it didn't sound so empty an' mockish; but when you come to boil it down the' ain't nothin' in that theory. Why, I'd seen the ol' man hunt Barbie all forenoon just to pick a quarrel with her; an' they would fuss an' stew an' revile each other an' keep it up all through dinner; an' then go off <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> an' scrap from wire to wire; but they was enjoyin' themselves fine, an' addin' to their stock of what is called mutual respect.

Having communicated my intentions to the officers and ships' companies, I directed several additions to be made to their ordinary allowance of provisions, particularly in the various antiscorbutics, which had hitherto been reserved for cases of emergency; and then beating up to our winter station, which I named Turton Bay, we anchored there <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in ten fathoms, and immediately commenced our preparations for lightening the Fury. Seven months' provisions, a bower anchor, and a few other stores, were received by the Hecla, some of her water, before filled as ballast, being started to make room for them; and such other arrangements made as circumstances would permit for improving the stowage of the Fury's hold.

After supper the duchess arranged a game of quinze with the two Englishmen and the two Saxons. The stakes were small, and the Saxons proved victorious. I had not taken any part in the game, but I resolved to do so the next evening. The following day we dined magnificently with the Prince of Francavilla, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he took us to the bath by the seashore, where we saw a wonderful sight. A priest stripped himself naked, leapt into the water, and without making the slightest movement floated on the surface like a piece of deal. There was no trick in it, and the marvel must be assigned to some special quality in his organs of breathing. After this the prince amused the duchess still more pleasantly.

Simcoe sat with his back to the bedroom door, and the other man on the other side of the hearthrug, facing him. I, therefore, decided to make the hole on the side nearest to the wall, so that I could see the other man past Simcoe. Of course I wanted the hole to be as low as possible, as it would not be so likely to be noticed as it would were it higher up. I chose a point, therefore, that would come level with my eye when I was kneeling down. \"At about four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they always went out, and from then till six Johnstone also took his airing, and I went upstairs to turn down the beds and tidy up generally. It was very seldom that any of them dined at home; I, therefore, had that two hours to myself.

Kate knew something of the romantic friendship that had been established between Herbert and Cubina. Yola had long ago told her of this--as well as the incident that had given origin to it. Perhaps that knowledge may explain the interest, almost amounting to anxiety, she now felt to ascertain the nature of the communication which the Maroon had hypothetically promised to make. It was only <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day--after the excursion to the Jumbe Rock--that the maid had imparted this piece of intelligence to her mistress: and the altered demeanour of the latter during the rest of the evening proved how interesting it must have been to her.

No further incident of importance occurred till <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we came suddenly on an outlying picket of the patriot forces. The main body of Washington's army was at this time encamped at a place called White Marsh, about fourteen miles to the north of Philadelphia. We had approached it from the north-east. The officer in command of the picket came forward, and Mrs Tarleton explained who she was, and her object in visiting the camp. \"Can you give me any information respecting my brother, Colonel Hallet?\" she asked with an...", "...burst forth. The whole of the salient angle and the stone cavalier in its rear were lifted into the air, and, after the smoke and clouds of dust had passed away, the bastion with three hundred men were seen precipitated below. The two grand divisions of the army now rushed up to the breaches, and the foremost of the opposing foe were soon laid low by the British bayonets, and the rest were chased along the ramparts; in two hours the whole of the rampart was in our possession, and early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the citadel surrendered. Doorjun Sal, who attempted to escape, was captured, together with his wife and two sons. The garrison consisted of 36,000 troops, near 10,000 of whom are said to have been slain during the siege. On the side of the British the loss was about 1200 men, many of whom were killed by the explosion of the great mine.

Young Potter's bill was tremendous, and Mrs. Bumboat bade him a regretful farewell when she visited us for the last time. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the tenth we hoisted anchor on our way to sea. Our good friends had not deserted us, and a number of them, aboard several tugs, accompanied us as far as the Narrows.

Its streets present marks of desolation, mouldering walls, and ruined churches, and its population has dwindled to little more than seven thousand inhabitants.

The ground is low and flat, and I was disappointed in the first view of the capital of Russia; but passing the barrier, and riding up the Newski Perspective, the most magnificent street in that magnificent city, I felt that the stories of its splendour were not exaggerated, and that this was, indeed, entitled to the proud appellation of the \"Palmyra of the North.\" My English companion again stopped at a house kept...", "...that's not here to use them, and even pretending that they are, if that will bring peace of mind, Mr. Hodges.\" He rubbed his clean shaven chin with his hand. \"Well, well!\" he said at last. \"Well, well, well!

She saw it and began to tremble and go white, and it came over me then that now or never was the time to clinch matters or she'd nearly die...", "...Duchess had consented to Clara giving lessons on the piano--that last refuge of the shabby-genteel. But pupils were scarce in Waterloo, and Clara's manner chilled the enthusiasm of parents who only paid for lessons on the understanding that their child was to become the wonder of the world for a guinea a quarter. This morning Clara was busy practising scales, while her mother dusted and swept with feverish haste, for Mr Jones, the owner of the great boot-shop, was bringing his son <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to arrange for lessons on the piano. The Duchess knew the singular history of Jonah, the boot king, and awaited his arrival with intense curiosity. She had married a failure, and adored success.

Chapman had returned from town, but had not brought Mr. Norwood home.

From the appearance of the column of smoke and the shells bursting in it, as if shot out of a huge mortar, it was evident that the accident was confined to one small spot, and the belief became general that the enemy had exploded an enormous mine. But after some time the truth became known, the troops were dispersed, and the tents repitched. This explosion was followed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> by a most terrific thunderstorm and heavy rain, which nearly washed away the camp. The storm came on as the non-commissioned officers of the Ninety-Third and No. 2 company were falling in to bury Colour-Sergeant Mackie, who had been knocked down by the sun the day before and had died that forenoon.

It consisted of four carriages, with six or eight horses each. The first was a large, stately, and cumbrous vehicle, padded and cushioned, in which, as we passed rapidly by, we caught a glimpse of a corpulent Russian on the back seat, with his feet on the front, bolstered all around with pillows and cushions, almost burying every part of him but his face, and looking the...", "...my pocket that would kill you.\" Marsh was angry.

THE DAY AFTER Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the next day three men and a boy approached the Breede house from that point of the compass toward which the boy had fled the preceding night. The men were in high spirits; they talked very loudly and laughed. They made facetious and good-humored ironical remarks to the boy about his adventure, which evidently they did not believe in. The boy accepted their raillery with seriousness, making no reply. He had a sense of the fitness of things and knew that one who...", "...who sleigh-ride in summer!

Then we'll discuss what's to be done with you,\" he added, smiling down at her. \"You won't let them keep me in bed, Barry, will you?\" urged Nan as he helped her up the steps and into the great hall, its ancient panelling of oak gleaming like polished ebony <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sunlight. Barry pulled thoughtfully at his big fair moustache. \"If Kitty says 'bed,' you know it'll have to be bed,\" he answered, his eyes twinkling a little. Nan subsided on to the wide, cushioned divan. \"Nonsense!\" she exclaimed crossly, \"You don't stay in bed because you've scratched your ankle.\" \"No. But you must remember you've had a bit of a shock.\" By this time Kitty and Roger had joined them, overhearing the last part of the conversation. \"Of...", "...hatchet we had. These were very valuable to them, for had they come into a grass-tree country they might have subsisted for a long time upon the tops of these trees, as Mr. Elliott did upon a former occasion; for he together with two men lived upon them for fourteen days. This very useful implement they however threw away the second day after we parted. We also left them all the fishing-hooks. Mr. Walker's party instantly commenced on the system of halting, and instead of moving on <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> remained where they were that day for the purpose of resting themselves. The country we travelled over for the first two miles was pretty good, being a series of grassy plains. At this point we came to a belt of thick wood which we found exceedingly difficult to traverse. We then continued our south by east course for four miles further over undulating sandy downs, and halted for the night in a small clump of Banksia trees which afforded plenty of wood for our...", "...been shocked, if, at that moment, I could have caught a vision of myself a month later, ashore in the most cursed place on earth and having a disgracefully good time along with eight hundred of the lepers who were likewise having a good time. Their good time was not disgraceful; but mine was, for in the midst of so much misery it was not meet for me to have a good time. That is the way I felt about it, and my only excuse is that I couldn't help having a good time. For instance, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the Fourth of July all the lepers gathered at the race-track for the sports. I had wandered away from the Superintendent and the physicians in order to get a snapshot of the finish of one of the races. It was an interesting race, and partisanship ran high. Three horses were entered, one ridden by a Chinese, one by an Hawaiian, and one by a Portuguese boy. All three riders were lepers; so were the judges and the crowd. The race was twice around the track. The...", "...was not a great point of the housekeeping, as may be understood from the fact that the sergeant of the guard was compelled to go and buy a bottle of Keating's Powder and some other disinfectant, the whole of which he had to sprinkle in the room allotted to the men as a guardroom, before it could be lived in. We only stayed a day and a half in Pretoria, as on the 6th of June we were sent by half battalions to Irene, about 12 miles off, the first party moving at three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and the others some hours later. The road winds for the first few miles, through a pass in the hills, in and out among dusty rocks, and then opens out on to the usual interminable veldt. Irene cannot be seen until the traveller is close upon it, as it lies in a fold of the ground; but it is not much worth seeing, anyhow, consisting merely of the railway station buildings, and some cement works. There is, however, a very successful irrigation farm in the...", "...belonging to M. and Madame Adnot, who were there, with their four children, the eldest a girl of 11 years. A few days after, on returning to the village, our soldiers found the seven bodies in the cellar lying in a pool of blood, several of them being horribly mutilated. Madame X. had her right arm severed from her body; the little girl's foot had been cut off, and the little boy of five had his throat cut. At Louveigne a certain number of men were shut up in a blacksmith's shop; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the murderers opened the door as if it were a pigeon-shooting competition, drove the prisoners out, and shot them down--a ghastly group of 17 corpses. At Senlis the heroic Mayor, M. Odent, and six members of his staff were shot. At Gerbeviller they forced their way into the house of M. and Madame Lingenheld; seized the son, aged 36, exempt from service, and wearing the badge of the Red Cross, tied his hands, dragged him into the street and shot him. They then...", "...Tree, with which I was so struck the beginning of the summer, I should bring it with me. There is a translation of it in English verse, that is little short of the original.

July 10.--The boats were now loaded, and Capt. Clarke divided his men into two bands. Sergt. Ordway, with nine men, in six canoes, was to descend the river; while Capt. Clarke, with the remaining ten, the wife and child of Chaboneau, and fifty horses, were to proceed by land to the Yellowstone. The latter party set out at five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> from the forks of the Missouri, in a direction nearly east. The plain was intersected by several great roads leading to a gap in the mountain about twenty miles distant, in a direction east-north-east; but the Indian woman, who was acquainted with the country, recommended another gap more to the south, through which Capt. Clarke determined to proceed. They started early the next morning, and, pursuing the route recommended by the squaw, encamped in the evening at the...", "...battlement of the fortress of Rensellaerstein.

Consequently he enjoyed presenting neckties to his friends. His biographer, Slason Thompson, who worked in the same newspaper office, separated only by a low thin partition, relates that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> about two o'clock Field would stick his head above the partition and say,--\"Come along, Nompy, and I'll buy you a new necktie,\" and when Thompson would decline the offer, Field would mildly respond, \"Very well, if you won't let me buy you a necktie, you must buy me a lunch,\" and off to the coffee-house they would march, where the bill would be paid by Thompson, for Field was indeed through life the gay knight he styled himself, _sans peur and sans monnaie_....", "...II ODOURS OF PARADISE I went down to Arfon in the very heat and bloom and fragrance of the wonderful summer that they were enjoying there. In London there was no such weather; it rather seemed as if the horror and fury of the war had mounted to the very skies and were there reigning. In the mornings the sun burnt down upon the city with a heat that scorched and consumed; but then clouds heavy and horrible would roll together from all quarters of the heavens, and early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the air would darken, and a storm of thunder and lightning, and furious, hissing rain would fall upon the streets. Indeed, the torment of the world was in the London weather. The city wore a terrible vesture; within our hearts was dread; without we were clothed in black clouds and angry fire. It is certain that I cannot show in any words the utter peace of that Welsh coast to which I came; one sees, I think, in such a change a figure of the passage from the disquiets...", "...of the underground wires of the company, which held up until after the noon hour Tuesday before the cable in which they were incased gave way. The break, however, was south of Dayton, and Phoneton was still in touch with the flood-stricken city. Except for brief intervals, Bell remained on the roof of the building suffering the discomforts of pouring rain and low temperature, in order that the waiting world might have some word from Dayton. EXPERIENCES OF THE SUFFERERS Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> several refugees told stories that gave an insight into conditions in East Dayton, hitherto unexplored. The flood victims declared they knew of no loss of life in this section, because a great number of people had availed themselves of warnings and fled. A Mrs. Van Denberg, who remained until the flood enveloped her home, when rescued declared she had seen no bodies in the flood. Sixty-five persons were marooned in the central police station. Nothing had been heard...", "...ill content. Rusticity in the rough they would decidedly not have approved of; rusticity in the smooth they liked very well. Mrs. Windsor was wise in her generation. She was distinctly not a clever woman, but she distinctly knew her world. The two tall footmen were the motto of her social life. She and Lady Locke, and the latter's little boy Tommy, came down from London by train in the morning of the Wednesday on which the Surrey week was to begin. The rest of the party was to assemble <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in time for tea. Tommy was in a state of almost painful excitement, as the train ran very slowly indeed through the pleasant country towards Dorking. He was a plump little boy, with rosy cheeks, big brown eyes, and a very round head, covered with exceedingly short brown hair. His age was nine, and he wore dark blue knickerbockers and a loose, bulgy sort of white shirt, trimmed with blue, and ornamented with a wide and flapping collar. His black stockings covered frisky...", "...cheap ornaments of the pedlar at the door.

Her mistress may snap occasionally, her master may grumble, and the dairymaid may snarl; but there are no slaps on the ear, no kicks, no going to bed supperless. In summer she goes out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> haymaking as an extra hand, but only works a few hours, and it is really only a relaxation. She picks up some knowledge of cooking, learns how to make herself useful in the house, and in the course of a year or two, if moderately sharp, is capable of rising a degree, and obtaining a better salary as a maid-servant, having nothing to do with a dairy.

Toward the end of the day the first corps arrived, under Davout, who since Krasnoe had again commanded the rear guard. This was the only corps which still had some military appearance. The day of November 27th. was occupied to cross the Beresina and to prepare for a desperate resistance, for the Russians could no longer be deceived as to the location of the bridges. At 2 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a third accident happened, again on the bridge to the left. It was soon repaired, but the vehicles arrived in great numbers, and all were pressing forward in such a way that the gendarmes had extraordinary difficulties to enforce some order. The 9th. corps, that of Marshal Victor, had taken a position between Borisow and Studianka, in order to protect the army at the latter place. It had been foreseen that the crossing would be little interfered with during the...", "...I need not here recount the varied topics discussed during that memorable evening: but it may be readily imagined with how swift a flight one hour followed another, while I listened with eager impatience to Lieutenant Grey's account of a country and people till now unknown even to English enterprise.

I took the boat <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at high-water to proceed to the encampment, which we were then able to approach within a quarter of a mile. It was situated in the depth of a creek, into which a clear and sparkling stream of fresh water poured its abundance: the shore was formed of enormous granite boulders, which rendered it hardly accessible except at high-water; and the red sandstone platform which is here the nature of the coast, was abruptly intersected by one of those singular valleys which give...", "...were fishing on the river with drag nets between two canoes, thus intercepting the salmon coming up the river. At last, on Saturday, the 20th of July, 1793, they emerged from the Salmon River into an arm of the sea (probably near King Island). The tide was out, and had left a large space covered with seaweed. The surrounding hills were involved in fog.... The bay appeared to be some three miles in breadth, and on the coast the travellers saw a great number of sea otters.[13] At two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the swell was so high, and the wind, which was against them, so boisterous, that they could not proceed along the seacoast in their leaky canoe. A young chief who had come with them as one of their guides, and who had been allowed to leave when the seacoast was reached, returned bearing a large porcupine on his back. He first cut the animal open and threw its entrails into the sea, then singed the skin and boiled it in separate pieces; nor did he go to rest till, with...", "...Harold had talked so fast that his grandmother could hardly follow him, but she understood what he said last, and started as if he had struck her a blow. \"Arthur Tracy! Coming home to-night!\" she exclaimed. \"Oh, I am so glad.\" \"But Mrs. Tracy did not seem to be, and I guess she wanted to stop the party,\" Harold said, repeating as nearly as he could what had passed between him and the lady. Harold was full of the party to which he believed he had been invited, and when <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Dick St. Claire came to the cottage to play with him, he felt a kind of patronizing pity for his friend who was not to share his honor. \"Perhaps mother will let me come over and help you,\" Dick said. \"I know how they do it. You mustn't talk to the people as they come up the stairs, nor even say good-evening,--only: \"'Ladies will please walk this way, and gentlemen that!'\" And Dick went through with a pantomime performance for the benefit of Harold, who, when the...", "...since the bed of the stream was little impeded, save for a few boulders at scattered intervals. But despite the smoothness of the stream, the banks overhung the river so far as to cause a most unpleasant sensation of fear. It seemed to the boy every minute as though the pendent masses of earth and rock would fall and overwhelm them, and the boy could tell, from the anxious glances cast overhead by Rivers, that the same thought was disturbing the chief of the party. About two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the third day they ran through a long gorge of this undercut character, and one, moreover, from which little trickling muddy streamlets showed that the frozen ground was thawing under the hot August sun.

Suddenly the boy heard a warning cry from the other boat, and looking overhead, saw a mass of snow and earth detach itself from the top of the cliff four hundred feet...", "...down my newspaper, and, looking up, saw that she was bubbling over with some story. \"Well?\" I said, encouragingly. \"It's about Mr. Vaughan, sir, I wanted to speak to you. I really do think, sir, it's not safe he should be left alone with his father, sir, any longer. Such doings as we had here the other day, sir! Somehow or other--and none of us can't think how--the Major had managed to get hold of a bottle of brandy. How he had it I don't know; but we none of us suspected him, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he says he was too poorly to go for a drive or to go out in his chair, and settles off on the parlour sofa for a nap while Mr. Vaughan goes out for a walk. Mr. Vaughan was out a couple of hours.

Forty miles to the south, somewhere on the Porcupine, were the lines of Henry Langlois, the post's greatest fox-hunter. On the morning of the third day, Jan set off in search of Langlois; and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day he came upon a well-beaten snow-shoe trail. On this he camped until morning. When dawn came he began following it. He passed half a dozen of Langlois' trap-houses. In none of them was there bait. In three the traps were sprung. In the seventh he found the remains of a red fox that had been eaten until there was little but the bones left. Two houses beyond there was an ermine in a trap, with its head eaten off. With growing perplexity, Jan examined the...", "...me, and that night I lay in a small northern town that stands upon the borders of smokedom at the gate of the great moors; and at seven the next morning I took my seat beside a one-eyed carrier behind an ancient piebald mare.

The nineteenth century, with its turmoil, fell away behind us; the distant hills, creeping nearer, swallowed us up, and we became but a moving speck upon the face of the quiet earth. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we arrived at a village, the memory of which had been growing in my mind.

How happy he was! He realized what this would mean for himself and for the people. These elk-dogs would rapidly increase in number; there would soon be enough of them for all the people, and then they would ride instead of walk, and their lodges and all their belongings would be carried by the animals.

Dumb with misery the crowd looked on. All through the day the ambulances had been arriving, and all day long the ragged throng whimpered and shivered by the barriers. At noon the crowd was increased ten-fold, filling the squares about the gates, and swarming over the inner fortifications.

The sad accessories of Fanny's end confronted him as vivid pictures which threatened to be indelible, and made life in Bathsheba's house intolerable. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he found himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length, which ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel with the shore, and forming a monotonous barrier between the basin of cultivated country inland and the wilder scenery of the coast.

As soon as he was gone I hastened to the...", "...of the townspeople, the young men passed the night quietly with Seymour's aunt, his only relative, and at four o'clock on Christmas morning, accompanied by Bentley and Talbot, they set forth upon their long cold ride to Washington's camp,--a ride which was to extend very much farther, however, and be fraught with greater consequences than any of them dreamed of, as they set forth with sad hearts upon their journey. CHAPTER XX _A Winter Camp_ About half after one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of Wednesday, December 25th, being Christmas day, and very cold, four tired horsemen, on jaded steeds, rode up to a plain stone farmhouse standing at the junction of two common country roads, both of which led to the Delaware River, a mile or so away. In the clearing back of the house a few wretched tents indicated a bivouac. Some shivering horses were picketed under a rude shelter, formed by interlacing branches between the trunks of a little grove of thickly...", "...the public fears were in a great measure allayed. With perhaps but three exceptions, no more popular choice could have been made, and I do not think I am breaking faith with my colleagues when I say that we were all agreed upon this point. The decision was arrived at on Wednesday afternoon, and orders were issued that the General in question should sail from Southampton on the following Saturday. On the Friday morning he was to be present at an important Council at the War Office; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he was to be received in Audience at Windsor, and at eleven o'clock on Saturday morning he was due to leave Waterloo for Southampton Docks. Now, Woller and I had been friends for many years, and immediately his appointment was made known, I hastened to write him a letter of congratulation. In it I said that if he should have sufficient time at his disposal to allow me a chance of seeing him, before he left London, I should like to shake him by the hand and wish him...", "...worthy of her,\" thought he, \"I will do my best to aid her; but if not, I will open her eyes.\" At four o'clock in the morning he was still seated musing before the expiring embers of his fire; he had made up his mind to see Andre--there was no difficulty in this, for a man of taste and wealth can find a ready excuse for visiting the studio of a struggling artist. He had no fixed plan as to what he would say or do, he left all to chance, and with this decision he went to bed, and by two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he drove straight to the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne. Andre's discreet portress was as usual leaning on her broom in the gallery as M. de Breulh's magnificent equipage drew up. \"Gracious me!\" exclaimed the worthy woman, dazzled by the gorgeousness of the whole turnout; \"he can't be coming here, he must have mistaken the house.\" But her amazement reached its height when M. de Breulh, on alighting, asked for Andre. \"Fourth story, first door to the right,\"...", "...the idle rumors which malicious persons may spread.\" At Prague the festivities continued without interruption: June 10, the Empress of France gave a dinner, and at the Court Theatre there was a performance of a German play, Kotzebue's \"American\"; on the 11th, the Emperor of Austria gave a dinner; on the 12th, they visited the Imperial Library, the Drawing-School, the Museum of Machinery, and in the evening there was a concert; the 10th, the Archdukes Anthony and Reinhardt arrived; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Marie Louise gave a ball in honor of her sisters, the three young Archduchesses; the 14th, they visited the Park of Bubenet; the 15th, the gardens of Count Wratislau, and the estate of Count von Clam; the 16th, a picnic at Count von Chotek's castle, seven leagues from Prague, a sail in the boats, return to Prague, and the arrival of Archduke Albert. The 18th, the Empress Marie Louise rode in the riding-school of the Wallenstein Place; the Prince of Ligne arrived, of...", "...itself, although the mystery remained as black and sinister as ever. Wiley, still hors de combat from his thrashing at Thode's hands, could scarcely have been a factor himself in this new development and if it proved to be the result of any of his agents' activities, surely Dan would be able to find some trace. She passed a sleepless night, however, and arose to find a foot of snow glistening on the ground and the air keen and brittle with cold. No word came from Dan, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she threw discretion to the winds and went boldly to the Brooklyn house. Nothing had developed save that Jose had worried himself into a fever, and the Senora Rodriguez's lamentations were tinged with a querulous resentment. The young Senorita was paying handsomely for the hospitality to her friends, and she herself would gladly do anything to aid her country-people, even if they were but Mexican Spanish and not of the blood. Nevertheless, she was not to blame...", "...time listening to his flood of talk and questions. The bolts had come at last, and when he had secured them and the other things from the store, Buck promptly mounted and set out on his return. Tex met him just outside the corral and received the letter without comment, thrusting it into his pocket unread. He seemed much more interested in the arrival of the bolts, and after dinner set Stratton and McCabe to work in the wagon-shed replacing the broken ones. It was not until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that Buck managed a few words in private with Jessup, and was surprised to learn that the gang had been working all day to the southeast of the ranch. Tex himself had been absent from the party for an hour or two in the morning, but when he joined them he came from the direction of the Paloma trail, and Stratton did not believe he could have had time thoroughly to inspect the middle pasture and return so soon by so roundabout a course. \"He'll do it to-morrow, sure,\"...", "...she had gained a complete victory over him, he left her. The whole of the court, that is to say, all the favorites and more intimate associates, and they were numerous, since there were already five masters, were assembled in the evening for the repetition of the ballet. This interval had been occupied by poor De Guiche in receiving visits; among the number was one which he hoped and feared nearly to an equal extent. It was that of the Chevalier de Lorraine. About three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the chevalier entered De Guiche's rooms. His looks were of the most reassuring character. \"Monsieur,\" said he to De Guiche, \"was in an excellent humor, and no none could say that the slightest cloud had passed across the conjugal sky. Besides, Monsieur was not one to bear ill-feeling.\" For a long time past, during his residence at the court, the Chevalier de Lorraine had decided, that of Louis XIII.'s two sons, Monsieur was the one who had inherited the father's...", "...blacksmith's wife, or Mrs. Pevear, the carriage-painter's? Or even good, homely Mrs. Ingraham, over the bake-shop? It is so much easier for girls to come together; girls of this day, especially, who in all classes get so much more of the same things than their mothers did. Sylvie, authorized by this feeble acquiescence in what made \"no difference,\" went on with her intention of having Ray Ingraham for her intimate friend. She spent many an hour, as the summer wore away, at the time <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Mrs. Argenter was always lying down, in the pleasant bedroom over the shop, that looked out under the elm-tree. This was Ray Ingraham's leisure also; the bread carts did not come in till tea time, with their returns and orders; the day's second baking was in the oven; she had an hour or two of quiet between the noon business and the night; then she was always glad to see Sylvie Argenter come down the street with her little purple straw work-basket swinging from...", "...said. But everybody knew she was lying. The girl whose sister was a skirt-finisher and who knew all about strikes took down the names and addresses of the twelve women. Mrs. Weinstein promised to look after Mrs. Cohen. And Yetta started uptown to the office of the Woman's Trade Union League. And all the long walk her heart was chanting a glad hosanna. She wasn't a speeder any more. She could look free people in the face. CHAPTER X THE W. T. U. L. It was near five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Yetta reached the brown-stone front which held the offices of the Woman's Trade Union League. It had once been a comfortable residence. But Business, ever crowding northward on Manhattan Island, had driven homes away. The house seemed dwarfed between two modern buildings of twelve and eighteen stories. In what had formerly been the \"parlor,\" Yetta found a rather barren, very businesslike office. Two stenographers were industriously hammering their typewriters,...", "...sticks from the forest, like figures in old fairy tales. He must have told himself that the time might come when something like the transformation of a fairy-tale would be effected on his account; the plain living and high-thinking and college discipline of Bonn be exchanged for the dignity and influence of an English sovereign's consort. Then, perhaps, he would bring his bride to the dear old \"fatherland,\" and show her where he had dreamt about her among his books. At the banquet <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the accomplished King gave the Queen's health in a speech fit for a poet. He referred to a word sweet alike to British and German hearts. Thirty years before it had echoed on the heights of Waterloo from British and German tongues, after days of hot and desperate fighting, to mark the glorious triumph of their brotherhood in arms. \"Now it resounds on the banks of our fair Rhine, amidst the blessings of that peace which was the hallowed fruit of the great conflict.

Then he made up a roasting fire, having some vague notion brought over from his boyhood that fever patients ought to sweat. Past this, he made a sad cake of pan-bread for his own midday meal, and when it was eaten he found that Lucetta had fallen asleep, and was further encouraged when he saw that fine little beads of perspiration had broken out on her forehead. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before she awoke and called him. \"Are you feeling any better?\" he asked. \"Much better; only I'm so warm I feel as if I should melt and run away. Can't you take at least one of the blankets off?\" \"Not yet. You like to cook things, and I am giving you some of your own medicine. This is Domestic Science as applied to the human organization.

Oliver Cromwell and several of his party used to meet there in consultation; there were several meetings; he remembered one in particular when Peters was there; he came about four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and stayed till ten or eleven at night; they were talking about the King after he was a prisoner, for they called him by the name of Charles Stuart; they were writing something, but the witness could not say what. He could not say whether Peters was there oftener than once, 'but once I am certain of it; this is the gentleman; for then he wore a great sword.' PETERS--I never wore a great sword in my life. _Starkey_ deposed that in the December before the King's...", "...to dress as fairies of both sexes, as they were required to appear in the _tableau_ of \"Fairyland.\" But the managers of the affair had conceived the idea that it would be a good scheme to reconstruct the wrecked flower barge and have the Queen of Flowers in the procession. But the Queen of Flowers seemed to be a mystery to every one, and the managers knew not how to reach her. They made many inquiries, and it became generally known that she was desired for the procession. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the managers received a brief note, purporting to be from the Flower Queen, assuring them that she would be on hand to take part in the evening parade. The flower barge was put in repair, and piled high with the most gorgeous and dainty flowers, and, surmounting all, was a throne of flowers. Before the time for starting the mysterious masked queen and her attendants in white appeared. When the procession passed along the streets the queen was recognized...", "...not altogether a sheltered position, and as I reached the table I felt the bleak and chilly air penetrating the crevices of the window, a raw ocean breeze that in a few instants crept through my bones. But I was again unconscious of everything; that marvellous ticking obliterated all thought of earth, its affairs, accidents, dangers, loves, hopes, despairs, all forgotten, swallowed up in the immeasurable revelation I was about to receive. The second message began at about 4 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of November 25, 1893, two months exactly after the first. Its very opening sentences I failed to get. It lasted late into the morning of the next day. The strain of taking it was somehow singularly intense upon me. I was taken from the table the next morning unconscious. I had fainted at the close. It began, as I received it, a few opening sentences having been lost: \"...was sent to you I was in the City of Light, and now I am in the City of Scandor. \"The morning...", "...I emerged from the District Railway into that faint but inexorable smell of burnt coffee and human unwashedness which broods over Whitechapel Road, the extra bulge in my breast-pocket reminded me suddenly of wind-blown gorse and all the hard-bitten, sunburnt heath that stands for Dartmoor.

A poor presage for my lucidity <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> march round the wards, I can hear you murmur. But you are wrong there. For, on the contrary, the points of my discourse made their bows to my memory with unwonted briskness; and I contrived, I think, to keep the notebook-pencils pretty busy. Yet the afternoon did contain one of those disquieting surprises that used at one time to seem so catastrophic, and now appear only too wonderfully uncommon. For some weeks past I have had a poor fellow in one of my beds, a...", "...city. Our Lord had not eaten anything from Thursday evening, and then with all He suffered and the loss of blood, He must have been very weak at eleven o'clock on Friday morning. He was weak, and fell many times under the Cross. His suffering was increased by seeing His Blessed Mother looking at Him. When He arrived at Calvary they tore off His garments and nailed Him to the Cross, driving the rough nails through His hands and feet. It was then about twelve o'clock. From twelve to three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Our Blessed Saviour was hanging on the Cross, with a great multitude of His enemies about Him mocking and saying cruel things. Even the two thieves that were crucified with Him reviled Him, though one of them repented and was pardoned before death. Our Lord's poor Mother and His few friends stood at a little distance witnessing all that was going on. When Our Lord was thirsty His executioners gave Him gall to drink. At three o'clock He died, and there was an earthquake...", "...During the morning, the men, about 500 in number, assembled at their stations on the vessels and pontoons. Captain Claxton had command of the arrangements afloat, and as a reserve force to act in any emergency several boats were lent from H.M.S. 'Ajax' and the Dockyard. With Mr. Brunel were Mr. Brereton and Captain Harrison, the commander of the 'Great Eastern.' Mr. Robert Stephenson was expected, but a serious attack of illness prevented him from being present. At about one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> signals from the tops of the temporary piers on which the truss rested, showed that the ends had been lifted three inches clear. Mr. Brunel then gave the signal for the men in the pontoons to haul on the warps, and the great structure glided slowly out to the centre of the river. A pause was then made, while the warps which were to swing the truss round into its place were being attached to the pontoon which was farthest from the centre pier. When this was done, the...", "...of ancient pattern, with a statue of the dead Christ on the ground beneath the slab.

I had left the village of Montpeyroux, with the sound of flails weakening on the wind, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> was drawing near to the Castle of Montaigne, when a small wayside auberge tempted me from the hot road. The woman who waited upon me had a fat body and a hard, firmly inquisitive face--a combination to be distrusted. Having settled down again to her knitting, she inquired of me where I was going, and when I told her that I was on my way to the Chateau de Montaigne, she asked me if I had any work to do there. I evaded this question, not knowing, or not wishing to know,...", "...make you believe the story ... he had an old grudge against the poor baron, who years ago brought him to punishment for theft.

They took it with a calm cheerfulness, which was rather disappointing, for it seemed that her departure would not make much difference to anyone in Ramsgate. It was a little depressing. There were now only two more good-byes to be said, and they were to Monsieur and Mademoiselle De La Roche, who arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and stayed some time receiving congratulations, and talking over the wonderful change in their fortunes with Aunt Hannah.

The sun was now climbing toward the zenith, and the Doctor's flies seemed to have lost their attractiveness for the wary bass, while the Shiner, seeking deeper water, was still successful in his efforts. The day, however, was becoming uncomfortably warm. \"You will admit, Doctor, that you must cast your flies early in the day or late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to insure much success, while I can fish during the middle of the day in deeper water and still have a measure of reward, which I consider quite an advantage of bait over fly.\" \"Granted. Fish rise to the fly only in comparatively shallow water, and are found in such situations in bright weather only early and late in the day. But I prefer to fish at just those times. I do not care to fish during the middle portion of the day in summer.\" And the Doctor proceeded to...", "...Mountains are in view, and peaks of the Uinta. To the east I can see the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains, more than 150 miles distant. The air is singularly clear to-day; mountains and buttes stand in sharp outline, valleys stretch out in perspective, and I can look down into the deep canyon gorges and see gleaming waters. Descending, I cross to a ridge near the brink of the Canyon of Lodore, the highest point of which is nearly as high as the last mentioned mountain. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I stand on this elevated point and discover a monument that has evidently been built by human hands. A few plants are growing in the joints between the rocks, and all are lichened over to a greater or less extent, giving evidence that the pile was built a long time ago. This line of peaks, the eastern extension of the Uinta Mountains, has received the name of Sierra Escalante, in honor of a Spanish priest who traveled in this region of country nearly a century ago....", "...after a heavy shelling of Bellevue, which he now knew was lost to him--a bitter surprise to his regimental and divisional commanders. It is uncertain what delayed his counter-attacks, but the mud had something to do with it, for on the German side as well as on ours there are swamps in which tall men sink to their necks, and bogs in which they are stuck to their knees, so badly that some of our prisoners lost their boots in getting free of this grip. It was at about four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that the first German column tried to advance upon Bellevue from the northern end of the spur. They were caught in our barrage and shattered. Half an hour later another heavy attack was delivered against the Canadians on the main Passchendaele Ridge, and this was repulsed after close and fierce fighting, in which fifty prisoners were taken by our side. All through the night, after those vain efforts to get back their ground, the enemy shelled the Canadian positions...", "...and by comparing their lunar observations with those of Lieutenant Ball, they found its longitude to be 159 deg.. 10'. 00\". east of Greenwich. The mean state of the thermometer, during their short stay, was 66 deg.. and the variation of the compass, by many observations, was found to be 10 deg.. east. In the afternoon the pinnace was hoisted in, and they made sail to the eastward with a fresh breeze at south-west. Nothing material occurred till the 31st, when about three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they saw two islands, one bearing north-east, half east, seven leagues, and the other east by south, about six leagues distant. Not having an opportunity of getting well in with the land before night came on, they plied occasionally under an easy sail, and at day-light next morning [1 June 1788] made sail and bore up for it. On approaching the southernmost land, they found it to form two barren isles, separated by a channel about a quarter of a mile over, and...", "...at ten o'clock every morning to give her lessons.

One of the encounters rose almost to the dignity of a battle. A heavy division of Northern regulars drove in all the Southern skirmishers, but Jackson, sending forward a strong force, pushed back the regulars in their turn. Harry watched the fighting most of the time, but at other times he watched his general's face. It was the usual impenetrable mask, but late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Harry saw a sudden sparkle in the blue eye. He always believed that at that moment the general divined the enemy's intentions, but the boy never had any way of knowing. Scouts came in presently and reported that another heavy column was marching from the Rappahannock to join Hooker in the Wilderness, and now the advance of the Southern force became slower. It was obvious to Harry that Jackson, while resolute to follow Hooker, intended to guard against all...", "...sleep a while,\" said the Gay Lady to me. Her expressive lips had a curious little twist of scorn. \"I should, too, if I hadn't a new guest,\" said I. We tried not to smile at each other, but we couldn't quite help it.

Hogg is certain that he answered Shelley's note immediately on getting it, that he started for Edinburgh <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day, and that he made the journey to Edinburgh in the first week of September. Mr. Timothy Shelley's letter makes it certain the young men were together in Edinburgh in that week.

Next morning, the 16th, Hancock himself was in command, and captured another redan. Meade came up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and succeeded Hancock, who had to be relieved, temporarily, from the command of his corps on account of the breaking out afresh of the wound he had received at Gettysburg. During the day Meade assaulted and carried one more redan to his right and two to his left. In all this we lost very heavily.

I know of countless cases wherein it was desired to have women shadowed in order to learn of their actions during an evening, but because of their having visited department stores <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> detectives lost them and were not on hand to observe their movements in the evening. Occasions often arise when subjects visit theaters while under surveillance. Very often it is desired to know with whom subjects visit such places.

The latest unusually heavy storm was that which swept over the Republic during the first week of November, 1909, and caused much damage, especially in the Cibao. A sudden storm <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of August 29, 1916, accompanied by a kind of tidal wave, surprised the American 14,500 ton armored cruiser \"Memphis\" at anchor in the roadstead of Santo Domingo City and wrecked it against the rocky shore.

It amused Mark to make a fool of himself next morning in the general knowledge paper. He flattered himself that no candidate for a scholarship at St. Osmund's Hall had ever shown such black ignorance of the facts of every-day life. Had he been dropped from Mars two days before, he could scarcely have shown less knowledge of the Earth. Mark tried to convey an impression that he had been injudiciously crammed with Latin and Greek, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he produced a Latin prose that would have revolted the easy conscience of a fourth form boy. Finally, on the third day, in an unseen passage set from the Georgics he translated _tonsisque ferunt mantelia villis_ by _having pulled down the villas (i. e. literally shaved) they carry off the mantelpieces_ which he followed up with translating _Maeonii carchesia Bacchi_ as the _lees of Maeonian wine (i.e. literally carcases of Maeonian Bacchus)_. \"I say, Lidderdale,\"...", "...girl, and yet not to be shut out from an occasional taste of this sort of pleasure--it was certainly a pleasant combination.

At one point west of Bourlon the momentum of his first advance carried the enemy through our front line and a short way down the southern slopes of the ridge.

Our local reserves at once counterattacked and succeeded in closing the gap that had been made in our line.

The wild tulips, pinks, and verbenas dotting the green slopes furnished the only pleasant diversion from our arduous labor. Just as we turned the highest summit, the clouds shifted for a moment, and revealed before us two Kirghiz horsemen. They started back in astonishment, and gazed at us as though we were demons of the air, until we disappeared again down the opposite and more gradual slope. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we emerged upon the plain, but no post-road or station-house was in sight, as we expected; nothing but a few Kirghiz kibitkas among the straggling rocks, like the tents of the Egyptian Arabs among the fallen stones of the pyramids.

What incomparable sweetness in the form of the mouth! That is a head somewhat in the style of Carlo Dolce, though the outline of the brows and the eyes bring to mind Raphael in his noblest type. At last I cease to eat; I gaze and gaze; I would gaze till death. \"Thou wert not here yesterday,\" says Hela to Eva. \"I hoped all the afternoon to see thee run in.\" \"In the morning I had a rehearsal, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I wanted to see Magorski's picture.\" \"Didst see it?\" \"Not well, for there was a crowd--and thou?\" \"I went in the morning. What a poet!--one wishes to weep with those Jews.\" Eva looks at me, and my soul rises. \"I will go again, and as often as I can,\" says Hela. \"Let us go together; maybe we can go to-day? It was so agreeable to me not only to look at that picture, but to think that such power appeared among us.\" And people do not glorify that woman!...", "...in the matter could be better kept alive If she should hunt up her old trigonometry and learn that all over again! With this idea she left the young men, whose kindness to her she fully appreciated, and went to find her party. She soon found, on the yacht ready to go back to town, all but Miss Ray; she had chosen to take one of the many carriages which she had noticed were constantly taking passengers back and forth from the town to the Cliff, at the rate of ten cents apiece. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> their attention was arrested by another one of the town-criers,--Tom had learned that there were three in the town,--who was crying out that a meat-auction would be held that night at half-past six o'clock. When they were told that these meat-auctions had been the custom of the town for years, they were anxious to attend one; but another engagement at that hour prevented their so doing, much to Tom's regret. The next day was Sunday. As Bessie and Tom were anxious to...", "...my prejudice and write on ruled paper, with purple ink and an unpleasant pen, that it may be all of the Halden. The place is exactly what I wanted and needed. I am so delighted to have it to myself. I am the only guest in the castle, the only stranger in the town. I came to stay a day; I intend now to stay a week. Yesterday, my first whole day, was perfect. I went by train to Muehlehorn, and walked from there to Wallenstadt, came back for dinner, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> climbed the hill to Amden, where I found a hepatica in bloom, and had a beautiful view of the sunset. This morning there is a mist on the mountains, which is slowly rising, so I am using the time for letter-writing. Mountain-climbing is not yet inviting, owing to the snow; but, on the whole, the season of the year is not at all unfavorable. The loneliness is what I like best. The people do not interest me; I avoid them, and must appear...", "...of pink muslin, with harmonious hat, gloves, and sunshade, she made an agreeable and rather effective picture, despite her plain, round face and stoutish figure. She had the air of being a leader. Grafted on to the original simple honesty of her eyes there was the unconsciously-acquired arrogance of one who had always been accustomed to deference. Socially, Beatrice had no peer among the young women who were active in the Wesleyan Sunday-school. Beatrice had been used to teach <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> school, but she had recently advanced her labours from the afternoon to the morning in response to a hint that if she did so the force of her influence and example might lessen the chronic dearth of morning teachers. 'Good afternoon, Miss Tellwright,' Beatrice said as she came up. 'So you have come to look at the Park.' 'Yes,' said Anna, and then stopped awkwardly. In the tone of each there was an obscure constraint, and something in Mynors' smile of salute to...", "...boy found not one reason to believe that a chance to escape might come to him, and now was anxiety for his own safety more than doubled by the conviction forced upon him that Return Kingdom was gone forever--murdered, tortured, shot from ambush. He knew not how his life had been taken, but the certain evidence that Ree was dead was presented to him in the course of a night of savage barbarity the like of which few white men ever had equal opportunities of seeing. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of an ideal Indian summer day that Lone-Elk returned to the Delaware town. He brought bullets and this time powder also. Only a shrug of his bare shoulders marked his interest in the news when told that the \"witch\" was captured; that Little Paleface was even at the moment safely held captive beyond all possibility of escape. He did not so much as go to see and gloat over the unhappy prisoner; but a murderous gleam came in his eyes and he told Neohaw and several...", "...the Canadian literally bolted. Then ludicrous ill luck befell all the generals. Vincent had accompanied the raiders on horseback. When the bugles sounded \"retire,\" he gave his horse the bit, and in the pitch darkness the brute carried him pellmell along the wrong road, over fences and hayfields, some fifteen miles into the Back Country. Next day, when Vincent was missing, under flag of truce messengers went to the retreating American army to find if he were among the dead. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> his horse came limping into the Canadian camp. Chandler, the American officer, on awakening had sprung on horseback and spurred over the field shouting commands. In the darkness his horse fell and threw him. When Chandler came to himself he was prisoner among the Canadians. Winder's ill luck was equally bad. By the flare of the firing he saw what he thought was a group of artillerymen deserting a gun. Dashing up, he laid about him with his pistol, shouting, \"Come...", "...be able to row far with such oars as we have got. If we get a breeze it may save our lives.\" It was impossible to \"step\" a mast in the frail basket structure, but this difficulty was overcome by a simple contrivance. From thwart to thwart two poles were bound, and the mast, lashed between these poles with thongs of raw hide, was secured by shrouds of twisted fishing line running fore and aft. Sheets of bark were placed at the bottom of the craft, and made a safe flooring. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> on the fourth day when these preparations were completed, and it was decided that on the morrow they should adventure the journey. \"We will coast down to the Bar,\" said Rufus Dawes, \"and wait for the slack of the tide.

Their search was continued throughout the day, but when night fell it was still unrewarded. Not a sign had been discovered as to what had been the fate of the trapper. Upon the suggestion of Kit Carson, Reuben then led the way to the defile where he had passed the preceding night. Abundance of food had been secured, because late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a herd of buffaloes, numbering no less than five hundred, had appeared. Several of the animals had been shot by the hunters, who brought the meat which they had secured to the place that had been selected for the camp. Although Kit Carson did not refer to his fears, it was evident that he was somewhat uneasy, as several times signs of Indians had been discovered by the men in their search of the afternoon. Although he still did not refer to his fears, when...", "...great billows, as though the ocean itself were upon us. The next day we crossed a ferry on the Ashley River, and rode down the sand of Charlestown neck. And my most vivid remembrance is of the great trunks towering half a hundred feet in the air, with a tassel of leaves at the top, which my father said were palmettos. Something lay heavy on his mind. For I had grown to know his moods by a sort of silent understanding. And when the roofs and spires of the town shone over the foliage <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sun, I felt him give a great sigh that was like a sob. And how shall I describe the splendor of that city? The sandy streets, and the gardens of flower and shade, heavy with the plant odors; and the great houses with their galleries and porticos set in the midst of the gardens, that I remember staring at wistfully. But before long we came to a barricade fixed across the street, and then to another. And presently, in an open space near a large building, was a company...", "...and counsel. He aided him with his influence in various ways; thus, for instance, we read that he promised to introduce him to Madame Tatyszczew, the wife of the Russian Ambassador, and to Baron Dunoi, the president of the musical society, whom Chopin thought a very useful personage to know. At Malfatti's he made also the acquaintance of some artists whom he would, perhaps, have had no opportunity of meeting elsewhere. One of these was the celebrated tenor Wild. He came to Malfatti's <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of Christmas-day, and Chopin, who had been dining there, says: \"I accompanied by heart the aria from Othello, which he sang in a masterly style. Wild and Miss Heinefetter are the ornaments of the Court Opera.\" Of a celebration of Malfatti's name-day Chopin gives the following graphic account in a letter to his parents, dated June 25, 1831:-- Mechetti, who wished to surprise him [Malfatti], persuaded the Misses Emmering and Lutzer, and the Messrs.

That these settlers and their descendants received many a rude shock, and played their part nobly, has been proved, and is admitted on all hands. That they received less encouragement and help from those who induced them to emigrate than might have been expected, is equally certain. Brown and I chatted, more or less, of these things as we toiled up the slopes of the Zuurberg, where the original settlers had toiled fifty-five years before us, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> came to a pretty good inn, where a small misfortune befell us. While we were indulging in a cup of tea, one of our horses escaped. We had crossed the mountain range by that time, and the truant had a fine range of undulating country to scamper over. That animal gave us some trouble, for, although nearly a dozen men went, after him on horseback, he kept dodging about actively with many flourishes of heels and tail during the whole afternoon. When one is in no...", "...much like herself. She seized him by the neck and set off, carrying him across country toward the new den, a couple of miles away. Every little while she had to put her offspring down to rest and give it a chance to breathe. This made the moving slow, and the labour of transporting the pups occupied all that day, for Saddleback was not allowed to carry any of them, probably because he was too rough. Beginning with the biggest and brightest, they were carried away one at a time, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> only the runt was left. Tito had not only worked at digging all night, she had also trotted over thirty miles, half of it with a heavy baby to carry. But she did not rest. She was just coming out of the den, carrying her youngest in her mouth, when over the very edge of this hollow appeared the mongrel Hound, and a little way behind him Wolver Jake. Away went Tito, holding the baby tight, and away went the Dog behind her. _Bang! bang! bang!_ said the revolver....", "...but any individual member might contribute to the fund if he were fool enough. It is only common justice to say that none of them was. The _Camel_ merely parted her cable one day while I happened to be on board--drifted out of the harbor southward, followed by the execrations of all who knew her, and could not get back. In two months she had crossed the equator, and the heat began to grow insupportable. Suddenly we were becalmed. There had been a fine breeze up to three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and the ship had made as much as two knots an hour when without a word of warning the sails began to belly the wrong way, owing to the impetus that the ship had acquired; and then, as this expired, they hung as limp and lifeless as the skirts of a clawhammer coat.

It swayed from side to side, and struck several ruts, so that the occupants were tossed about. But the main thing was that they went ahead, and away from their enemies. Jerry, peering as best he could into the darkness ahead, made a course for the stream, intending to go close to it, and then run along the bank, or near it, as he had noted <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that there was a fairly good road there. Gradually the shouts of the men, and the firing of their guns died away, and the travelers began to breathe more freely. They had made their escape, and, for the present, were safe. \"Oh do let's stop and get a drink!\" pleaded Bob. \"Not yet!\" exclaimed Jerry. \"Five minutes more will not kill you, and it may save all our lives,\" for he did not want to slack up while there was any danger of the ranchmen coming after them....", "...Smith came, after a long absence from England; Professor Masson and Dr. Bastian, Madame Bodichon, and Dr. Payne.

Buck Badger stared at a letter in a familiar handwriting which had come to his room <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> mail. He had delivered to Donald Pike that threatening talk the night before, when Pike came back to the land of sentient things after that awful choking. The infliction of this punishment on Pike, and the feeling that Winnie would stand by him in spite of everything, had so satisfied the Westerner that he had been in an uncommonly comfortable frame of mind, in spite of the fact that the powerful opposition of Fairfax Lee was yet to be overcome. With Winnie true, and...", "...load of faggots, but once there we should have had no more chance of getting into the fortress than if we had at once proclaimed ourselves French officers, and had requested a pass into the citadel.\" For the next ten days every effort was made to obtain carts and pack horses from the villages round Susa, and a number of wagons filled with provisions were brought from Carignano, where the principal supplies for the army had been collected. On the fourteenth day all was ready, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the convoy, with fifteen hundred men from Susa, and four pieces of artillery, marched out. At the same hour the force at Carignano, six thousand strong, leaving only a small body to garrison the city, started for Turin along the farther bank of the Po, and just as day broke a heavy cannonade was opened by them against one of the city gates. Astonished and alarmed, the troops in the city flew to arms, and hurried to repulse the attack. A quarter of an hour later the...", "...and heavy. Each one was trying to outdo the other. The Solomon Islanders were in great danger from the flying two-by-fours, and even the cook was wielding the axe with greater skill as he drove it into the fibrous yams. This was a new departure in the handling of sailors, but so far it was working well. If it was necessary for Scotch whiskey to enter into the discharging of this cargo, I was going to see that each man had enough to stimulate him to even greater results. While ashore <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> ordering fresh meat and vegetables, I met Captain Kane, who insisted that I pay a visit to His Majesty's ship \"Pongon.\" In walking down the wharf, the Captain noticed a ship in the offing. He seemed interested as he hurried along to the cutter. \"You know,\" said he, \"my eyes are not as good as they should be, and I'll be damned if I know whether she is a coolie or a missionary ship.\" Contract labor is used here in working the rice fields and sugar plantations.

At dawn on August 30, the high spirited troops of the South were under arms standing with clinched muskets within a few hundred yards of the pickets of Pope. Their far flung battle line stretched for five miles from Sudley Springs on the left to the Warrenton road and on obliquely to the southwest. The artillery opened the action and for eight hours the heavens shook with its roar. At three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Pope determined to hurl the flower of his army against Jackson's corps and smash it. His first division pressed forward and engaged the Confederates at close quarters. A fierce and bloody conflict followed, Jackson's troops refusing to yield an inch. The Federal Commander brought up two reserve lines to support the first but before they could be of any use, Longstreet's artillery was planted to rake them with a murderous fire and they fell back in confusion.

When Bannelong came for his present, those who accompanied him, after staying a short time, went away, but he staid dinner, and left the place highly delighted with his shield, which being made of sole leather and covered with tin, was likely to resist the force of their spears. As it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before Bannelong thought of departing, his wife and sister, with two men, came over in their canoes to fetch him, so that there was every appearance of these people being perfectly reconciled, and no doubt could be entertained but that they would visit the settlement as frequently as could be wished.

In June I saw the annual races at Longchamps for the first time. Great was the splendour. From two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to six there was an uninterrupted stream of carriages, five or six abreast, along the Champs Elysees; there were thousands of _lorettes_ (as they were called at that time) in light silk gowns, covered with diamonds and precious stones, in carriages decorated with flowers. Coachmen and footmen wore powdered wigs, white or grey, silk stockings and knee-breeches and a flower in the buttonhole matching the colour of their livery and the flowers which hung about the horses'...", "...always carries some with him to remove grease spots from his clothes.\" \"Ha!

She was trying to amuse Enna's set, while her three companions and Herbert were taking care of themselves.

A shower at seven each morning keeps Puna always green. Our kind host, a German, married to a native woman, served our meals in a house made of grass and bamboo; but the wife and children, as is usual in these cases, never appeared at table, and contented themselves with contemplating us at a great distance. The next afternoon we rode to one of the...", "...across this place or my way down--told a plausible story (Heaven forgive me for deceiving so delightful a lady as Mrs. Page)--and here I am! And the sooner we set off from here, the sooner we will meet at the appointed town.\" \"When the war's over,\" remarked Macgreggor, \"you can earn a fortune on the stage.\" Half an hour later the four Northerners had taken a grateful farewell of the unsuspecting Mrs. Page, and were hurrying along the bank of the Tennessee. By four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they had reached a point directly opposite Chattanooga. Here they found a ferryman, just as they had been given to expect, with his flat \"horse-boat\" moored to the shore. He was a fat, comfortable-looking fellow, as he sat in tailor-fashion on the little wharf, smoking a corncob pipe as unconcernedly as though he had nothing to do all day but enjoy tobacco.

At four o'clock, when the barometer touched its minimum of 29.60, a nasty swell from the northeast, due to another shifting of the wind, began to make itself felt, and, though nothing carried away, the vicious twist of the cross surges made so bad a seaway that we were forced to reef down again and ride out the night head-reaching in a southwesterly direction. By morning of the 6th the gale had blown itself out, and at the change of watch all the reefs were...", "...Tellsplatte, and shall be happy to see you there.

We wasted no time, but took the first boat, and were presently steaming down the enchanting lake, the beauties of which perhaps only one of us thoroughly enjoyed, the little girl Barbara. \"Oh,\" she sighed, \"if Molly's 'ere, I don't wonder she never came back to London.\" It was three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when we landed at Tell's Platte. We were in no mood for sightseeing, and did not therefore visit the chapel, but ascended the hill that led to the hotel, where we found Mr. Rivers waiting for us. He came forward to greet us, a short, wiry man, with clean-shaved face, browned with exposure to the sun, and a bright eye. He addressed me by name. \"Mr. Emery?\" \"Yes.\" \"May I ask the name of the gentleman who is doing business for you in London?\" \"Mr....", "...return alone for the third time, we whispered hints of a dilatory sweetheart.

Nor would the General consent to imperil the ultimate success by asking his soldiers to make a supreme effort to redress a false tactical move. It was a principle which led us to much blood and bitter disappointment, but in the end to victory.

At no time could Dickens possibly be called cynical, he had too much vitality; but relatively to the other books this book is cynical; but it has the soft and gentle cynicism of old age, not the hard cynicism of youth. To be a young cynic is to be a young brute; but Dickens, who had been so perfectly romantic and sentimental in his youth, could...", "...the hotel seemed very pathetic to him. Love filled his heart with more sympathy for Christine upon her luxurious couch, in rapid convalescence, than for all the hopeless suffering of Chicago. What could he do for her?

But her heart would not be still, and every little outraged feeling in her body, finding a voice of its own, clamored aloud: \"Oh, if we could only pay 'em back! Oh, if we could only pay 'em back!\" Margery, alas! had not yet learned that forgiveness is sweeter than revenge. Of course she would forgive them if, say, a milk-wagon should run over her and she had only a few hours to live. Then how they would cry! But as it was too late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> for any milk-wagons to be about, such a death-bed forgiveness was clearly out of the question. So the one thing left was revenge. Yet what revenge was possible? None, absolutely none. That afternoon she was utterly powerless to shake by any act of hers the equanimity of those three complacent young persons. There was nothing belonging to them which she could smash, hide, or appropriate. There was nothing they had ever said or done which now, in her hour of need, she...", "...or of the chairs they occupied. I had seen and heard people shout at long intervals in church, but here, after a few soul stirring sermons, they began to run outside where there was more room to give vent to the hallucination and this wandering of the mind. It could be called nothing else, for after the first few sermons the evangelist would hardly be started before some mourner would begin to \"come through.\" This revival warmed up to such proportions that preaching and shouting began <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> instead of evening. Men working in the yards of the foundry two block away could hear the shouting above the roaring furnaces and the deafening noise of machinery of a great car manufacturing concern.

With nerves tense from anxiety, the two men crossed over to the control-panel of the recall apparatus. This time they donned goggles of dark glass to shield their eyes from the blinding green glare.

On the following morning we ran before a strong breeze and a heavy swell for some hours, but at length were obliged to seek shelter on a large island adjoining to Isle a la Cache of Mackenzie, where the following observations were obtained: latitude 61 degrees 50 minutes 18 seconds North, longitude 113 degrees 21 minutes 40 seconds West, and variation 31 degrees 2 minutes 06 seconds East. The wind and swell having subsided <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we reembarked and steered towards the western point of the Big Island of Mackenzie and, when four miles distant from it, had forty-two fathoms soundings.

We coasted along the eastern side of...", "...Sandy found pulled down in this manner. He knew that Kazan and Gray Wolf had done the work, for he found the marks of their feet in a dozen different places. The accumulated bad humor of weeks of futile labor found vent in his disappointment and anger. At last he had found something tangible to curse. The failure of his poison baits he accepted as a sort of climax to his general bad luck. Everything was against him, he believed, and he made up his mind to return to Red Gold City. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he launched his canoe and drifted down-stream with the current. He was content to let the current do all of the work to-day, and he used his paddle just enough to keep his slender craft head on. He leaned back comfortably and smoked his pipe, with the old rifle between his knees. The wind was in his face and he kept a sharp watch for game. It was late in the afternoon when Kazan and Gray Wolf came out on a sand-bar five or six miles down-stream. Kazan was lapping up...", "...prisoners. Since the 20th of May, 1915, the clearing of the road had been going on; Von Mackensen battering the western forts and the river line as far as Jaroslav, and Boehm-Ermolli struggling to force the southern corner to get within range of the Lemberg railway. On his right, Von Marwitz had become stuck in the marshes of the Dniester between Droholycz and Komarno. The Bavarians on the north again let fly their big guns against the forts round Dunkoviczki on May 31, 1915. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they ceased fire; the forts and defenses were crumpled up into a shapeless mass of wreckage. Now Prussian, Bavarian and Austrian regiments rushed forward to storm what was left. They still found some Russians there, severely mauled by the bombardment; but they could no longer present a front. They retreated behind the ring. The Tenth Austro-Hungarian Army Corps now made another attempt on Pralkovice and Lipnik.

Undressed, she sent her maid for a cup of tea, feeling too tired for luncheon. Afterward she lay down on her bed, meaning merely to close her eyes for a moment. It was after four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when she sat up with a start--too late for the Red Cross; but she could do something at the canteen. She went about dressing as though bruised. It seemed to take an interminable time. Her maid called a taxi; but the short winter daylight had nearly gone when she arrived at the canteen. She remained there on kitchen duty until seven, then untied her white tablier, washed, pinned on her hat, and went out into the light-shot darkness of the streets and turned her...", "...off, without either companion or servant, and wearing his uniform, partly because as a soldier he was proud of it, partly because experience had taught him that in these eastern regions a uniform inspires respect in the minds of innkeepers, if not in those of banditti.

At sunrise he resumed his course, walking amid picturesque scenery--on the right the sparkling sea, on the left glorious pine-clad mountains. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Paul, who had followed the post-road, reached a point where it entered a magnificent forest. As this wild-wood was just the sort of place where banditti might be expected to lurk, Paul's first impulse was to turn aside, and to take the more circuitous way along the sea-beach. \"You fear!\" a secret voice seemed to whisper: and the reproach decided his route. Not even in his own eyes would he be a coward. This choice of a road was but a small matter, one might think;...", "...day I went fishing in the morning, and in the afternoon I went up the creek again, fishing with Doctor Latham. He was doctor at the Indian agency. The next day I went down to Joseph's camp, where I stayed the rest of the time--about five months--alone with the Indians. The doctor and the teamster returned to the agency. During my first day in the camp, I wrote a letter to my mother, and bought a beaded leather belt from one of the squaws. I stayed about camp most of the first day; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I went fishing, and caught a nice string of trout. The Indian camp is usually in two or more long rows of tepees. Sometimes two or three families occupy one lodge. When they are hunting and drying meat for their winter supply, several lodges are put together, making one big lodge about thirty feet long, in which are two or three fires instead of one. They say that it dries the meat better. When game gets scarce, camp is broken and moved to a different place.

Here a strong tide, setting in to the shore, drifted the _Advance_ toward the beach, where she stranded. Around her were small bergs and large masses of floating ice, all under the influence of the strong current. It was about two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when she struck. By diligent labor in removing every thing from her deck to a small _floe_, she was so lightened, that at four o'clock the next morning she floated, and soon every thing was properly replaced.

It would run a little way into the drift, then back up, and again push its way into the drift as far as possible. It kept working its way forward in this manner from one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> until very nearly midnight, when we arrived at Sioux Falls. Sure enough, my provisions did run out on the way; but with the generosity peculiar to most people under like circumstances, the other passengers, although strangers to me, helped me out and supplied all the food needed.

Till five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> it was calm, but afterwards we steered before the wind N.W. as the land lay till ten at night, and then brought-to, having had all along fourteen and fifteen fathom. At five in the morning we made sail; and at day-light the northermost point of the main bore N. 70 W. Soon after we saw more land, making like islands, and bearing N.W. by N.

This point I found to lie directly...", "...road up to Mr. Harvey's house; for there his uncle, and two cousins, were waiting for him. Thomas and John, each grasped a hand, while their father led the way to the house. \"We were afraid you were not coming,\" said John. \"How tall you have grown since Christmas,\" exclaimed Thomas. \"Were you not tired of being in the hot city such weather as this?\" Samuel said that he was; and then they all entered the house, while the driver brought in Samuel's baggage. It was about five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Samuel reached his uncle's house. He was taken into a small parlor, which opened upon a garden where many flowers were in bloom. It was a warm day, but this room was cool and fragrant; and on the table were several plates of fruit, and some cakes, which his uncle caused to be placed there, so that he might eat some as soon as he arrived, While Samuel was eating some of them John said: \"We are so glad you have come, Samuel. Last winter you could see nothing but...", "...here. We walked next day over a more level country but it was strewed with large stones. These galled our feet a good deal; we contrived however to wade through the snow at a tolerably quick pace until five P.M., having proceeded twelve miles and a half. We had made today our proper course south by east which we could not venture upon doing before for fear of falling again upon some branch of the Contwoyto. Some deer were seen in the morning but the hunters failed of killing any and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we fell into the track of a large herd which had passed the day before but did not overtake them. In consequence of this want of success we had no breakfast and but a scanty supper, but we allayed the pangs of hunger by eating pieces of singed hide. A little tripe de roche* was also obtained. These would have satisfied us in ordinary times but we were now almost exhausted by slender fare and travel and our appetites had become ravenous. We looked however with humble...", "...at the town of Kavaroah, where we found a great number of canoes, just arrived from different parts of the island, and the Indians busy in constructing temporary huts on the beach, for their residence during the stay of the ships. On our return on board the Discovery, we learned, that an Indian had been detected in stealing the armourer's tongs from the forge, for which he received a pretty severe flogging, and was sent out of the ship. Notwithstanding the example made of this man, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> another had the audacity to snatch the tongs and a chisel from the same place, with which he jumped overboard and swam for the shore. The master and a midshipman were instantly dispatched after him, in the small cutter. The Indian, seeing himself pursued, made for a canoe; his countrymen took him on board, and paddled as swift as they could towards the shore; we fired several muskets at them, but to no effect, for they soon got out of the reach of our shot. Pareah, one...", "...the hills stretch down to the sea like the fingers of a hand spread out, and the main roads run down between them. I should have preferred to keep away from the coast and cross the remaining ranges by tracks and footpaths, but I wanted to see a relative who lives at Nice. Otherwise I should never have gone near such a place, for which I was quite unsuited, both in spirit and attire. Contes is only fourteen miles or so from Nice by a good road, and I thought I might pay my visit, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> get back into the hills again. But crowning the ridge opposite to the one I had come down the night before was the old deserted town of Chateauneuf, and in the soft early morning sunshine it looked so attractive that I thought I would go up to it, and walk down to Nice along the valley on the other side. It was a steep and stony climb. When I got a little way up I was already glad I had embarked upon it, for if I had gone down by the road I should have missed the...", "...faces to their God. Under the beat of the high sun the light stern wind fell. The slack sail drooped like a sick-hearted thing. Idly drifting on the slow glassy flood, we seemed only an incidental portion of this dream in which the deepest passions of man were bodied forth in eternal fixity. Towers of battle, domes of prayer, fanes of worship, and then--the kneeling women! Somehow one couldn't whistle there. Bill and the Kid, little given to sentiment, sat quietly and stared. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we found ourselves out of this \"Region of Weir.\" Great wall rocks soared above us. Consulting our map, we found that we were nearing Eagle Rapids, the first of a turbulent series. I had fondly anticipated shooting them all under power. So once more I decided to go over that engine. We landed at the wooded mouth of a little ravine, having made a trifle over twenty miles that day. With those tools of the engine doctor--an air of mystery and a monkey-wrench--I unscrewed...", "...sake of their skins, which were serviceable for the rigging; the boat's crew also found some penguins (Aptenodytes minor) and a nest of iguanas.

January 5. On the 5th <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> on our return to the vessel, after visiting the shore and landing upon the flat rock, which is merely a bare mass of granite, of about thirty yards in diameter, some natives were heard calling to us, and upon our pulling to the part whence the sound came, we found two men and a boy. After some time they were discovered to be three of our Oyster-Harbour friends, and therefore we made no hesitation of communicating with them, and of taking them on board, where they were...", "...voted for as president and vice-president.\" 4.

The remaining gun, with the two companies of the 2d Vermont, was kept in reserve at the cross-roads; while the Highlanders and Chasseurs were held in reserve a third of a mile back from the village, and two companies of the former were thrown out as skirmishers to cover the left flank and rear, and connected with the Indiana skirmishers on the Falls Church road. About three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the skirmishers were called in, and the column formed for the return march. Just as the bugle sounded \"Forward!\" a section of artillery, which the enemy, stealing up under cover of the woods as the Highlanders' skirmishers retired, had adroitly planted on the left rear, opened a brisk fire of shells over the head of the column as it marched back; and simultaneously a considerable force of their skirmishers from the Vienna and Falls Church roads advanced on the village...", "...at Banbury, and went little abroad; nor had we any action till the latter end of February, when I was ordered to march to Leicester with Sir Marmaduke Langdale, in order, as we thought, to raise a body of men in that county and Staffordshire to join the king. We lay at Daventry one night, and continuing our march to pass the river above Northampton, that town being possessed by the enemy, we understood a party of Northampton forces were abroad, and intended to attack us. Accordingly, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> our scouts brought us word the enemy were quartered in some villages on the road to Coventry. Our commander, thinking it much better to set upon them in their quarters, than to wait for them in the field, resolves to attack them early in the morning before they were aware of it. We refreshed ourselves in the field for that day, and, getting into a great wood near the enemy, we stayed there all night, till almost break of day, without being discovered. In the morning...", "...were the ladies? Oh! the ladies of Lancia know perfectly well what is due to themselves, and they had far too great a regard for the laws of good form to appear on days that were not fete days; and even then they did not do it without taking proper precautions. No lady of Lancia would think of being so vulgar as to go to the Bombe on a Sunday before the arrival of others of her class; and it was a superhuman effort to arrange for all to appear simultaneously. So after three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they were waiting about, gloved and bonneted, peeping at each other out of the windows. \"The Zamoras are coming now!\" \"There go the Mateos!\" And so they finally sallied forth in due dignity to the promenade where the band had been performing different fantasias on airs from \"Ernani\" or \"Nabuco\" for the edification of the children and a few appreciative artisans. It must not be thought that the distinguished society of Lancia went with one rush to the open-air...", "...without attempting to discover the secret for themselves. Blank fatalism possesses them. They do not realize that they could prosper. New methods of cultivation, they think, are not for them since they have no capital to purchase machinery. On the other hand, one sees more Ford cars than teams at many country churches, and many larger automobiles as well. Some Southern States are spending millions for better roads, and the farmer or his son or daughter can easily run into town <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> carrying a little produce which more than pays for any purchases. Tractors are seen at work here and there, and agricultural machinery is under the sheds. Many houses have private water systems and a few farmers have harnessed the brooks for electric lights.

Into these houses the carrier brings the daily or semi-weekly paper from the...", "...horses take us there, their work is done, so we can press them to the utmost. The troops will have been marching all night along the road on which the innkeeper set them; but by this morning they will begin to suspect that they have been put on a false scent, and as likely as not will send to Nantes. We must be first there, if possible.\" The horses, however, tired by their long journeys on the two preceding days, flagged greatly during the last half of the journey, and it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before they came in sight of Nantes. At a slight rise half a mile from the town Rupert looked back along the straight, level road on which they had ridden the last few miles of the journey. \"There is a body of men in the distance, marquis. A troop of cavalry, I should say. They are a long way behind--three miles or so; and if they are in chase of us, their horses must be fagged; but in five-and-twenty minutes they will be here.\" They urged their weary steeds into...", "...as soulless as a sphinx, who had offered herself to him in return for his name and millions, and of that other which he had met away up in the frozen barrens of Lac Bain.

Chapter VI. Philip Follows A Pretty Face It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Philip's instructions came from the inspector. They were tersely official in form, gave him all necessary authority, and ordered him to leave for Le Pas that night. Pinned to the order was a small slip of paper, and on this MacGregor had repeated in writing his words of a few hours before: \"Whatever happens, bring back your prisoner.\" There was no signature to this slip, and the first two words were heavily underscored. What did this double caution mean? Coming...", "...was posted a rhyme which read:-- \"A wise old owl lived in an oak, The more he saw, the less he spoke; The less he spoke, the more he heard; Soldiers should imitate that old bird.\" It was the first time that Talbot had seen this warlike ditty. Its intention was to guard soldiers from saying too much in front of strangers. Talbot vowed, however, to apply its moral to himself at all times and under all conditions. From nine in the morning until half-past two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they rolled along, and had covered by this time the extraordinary distance of about forty miles! Here at last was the station of Saint-P----. Talbot looked about him. Standing near was an officer with the Machine-Gun Corps Badge, whom he hailed, and questioned about the Headquarters of the Tank Corps. \"About ten miles from here. Are you going there?\" the fellow asked. Talbot explained that he hoped to, and being saturated with Infantry ideas, he wondered if a...", "...them!

He ascertained, however, that there was another train at five o'clock, and this he resolved to take. \"Where are we going, Ben?\" asked Emma, as they stepped out of the...", "...after the new year of 1835 Samson and Harry moved the Kelsos to Tazewell County. Mr. Kelso had received an appointment as Land Agent and was to be stationed at the little settlement of Hopedale near the home of John Peasley. \"I hate to be taking you so far away,\" said Samson. \"Hush, man,\" said Kelso. \"It's a thing to be thought about only in the still o' the night.\" \"I shall be lonesome.\" \"But we live close by the wells of wisdom and so shall not be comfortless.\" Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Harry and Samson left the Kelsos and their effects at a small frame house in the little village of Hopedale. The men had no sooner begun to unload than its inhabitants came to welcome the newcomers and help them in the work of getting settled. When the goods were deposited in The dooryard Samson and Harry drove to John Peasley's farm. Mr. Peasley recognized the big, broad-shouldered Vermonter at the first look. \"Do I remember you?\" he said. \"Well, I guess I do. So...", "...Remember the faithfulness of this true heart, and disappoint not its expectation.

Amen.\" \"Thank ye, doctor; ye 've said what I wantit, an'... it wes kind o' ye tae pit in Jamie,\" and his hand came out from the bed for a last grasp. He watched the minister go, and when Elspeth returned he said, \"Yon's a richt man.\" The upland children returning home from school <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> came to the cottage door, and Jamie, who had been dozing, heard their whispering. \"There's some o' thae prodigals oot there in the gairden; bring them in, Elspeth, or a' give them a hearin'; they 've juist been the torment o' ma life.\" They came in warily, as those who had some experience of former tricks, but there was no fear even among the girls.

They had proceeded about two miles along its edge, when they saw the stern of a boat projecting beyond the rushes that fringed the water's edge, and pushing more rapidly forward they came upon a beaten path through the reeds, and following this came upon a low flat boat, very roughly constructed. \"It is not much of a craft,\" Jim Tucker said; \"but it will do for us capitally.

They had already made another meal, and had finished their maize and water. They stood by the boat waiting until it should become perfectly dark, and looking across the tranquil sheet of water at the distant town, over which the smoke still hung heavily, and as the sky darkened flashes of fire could be seen. They were at...", "...for shipping, conveniently situated for carrying on the survey, in a place which otherwise I should certainly have overlooked: and to that harbour I decided on proceeding. \"For two miles to the eastward of Stewart Harbour, the shore projects, and is rocky and broken, then it retreats, forming a large bay, in which are the Gilbert Islands, and many rocky islets.

Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the 5th Mounted Rifles were nearly blown out of Maple Copse. The Germans got into the support line on the left, and the Princess Patricias bayoneted a large number in a hand-to-hand struggle.

It has on board a piano and an organ, both of which are played by electricity, which is in some respects satisfactory, but the _tempo_ of the _Meistersinger_ Overture which was performed for us was accelerated out of all recognition. _Tuesday, August_ 16_th_. A Miss Simpson called <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to ask Mrs Housman to help with some local charity; she lives at the Hotel. She said she found it very inconvenient not being able to go to Church. We wondered what prevented her doing so, but she soon gave us the reason herself. She said that the local clergyman was so low--no eastward position.

This school too she gave up for the position of librarian of the Nantucket Atheneum, which office she held for nearly twenty years. This library was open only in the afternoon, and on Saturday evening. The visitors were comparatively few in the afternoon, so that Miss Mitchell had ample leisure for study,--an opportunity of which she made the most. Her visitors <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> were elderly men of leisure, who enjoyed talking with so bright a girl on their favorite hobbies. When they talked Miss Mitchell closed her book and took up her knitting, for she was never idle. With some of these visitors the friendship was kept up for years. It was in this library that she found La Place's \"Mecanique Celeste,\" translated by her father's friend, Dr. Bowditch; she also read the \"Theoria Motus,\" of Gauss, in its original Latin form. In her capacity...", "...an indefinite number of times and over such roughness as their imaginations had never even suggested. What grinding, heaving and bumping over huge boulders! What shouting and urging of animals, what weary hours of tortured endurance dragged along!

Only at night could the desert be safely crossed. Starting at four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they traveled all the following night over an arid, desolate region, the Green River desert, thirty miles, a strange journey in the dimness of a summer night with only the star-lamps overhead. In sight of the river, the animals made a rush for the water and ran in to drink, taking the wagons with them. Often the names of the streams crossed were indicative of their character, suggestive of adventure or descriptive of their surroundings. Thus \"Sweetwater\" speaks...", "...over the portage, Churchill ran to his state-room. He turned the contents of the clothes-bag on the floor and caught up the grip, with the intention of entrusting it to the man next door. Then the thought smote him that it was not his grip, and that he had no right to let it out of his possession. So he dashed ashore with it and ran up the portage changing it often from one hand to the other, and wondering if it really did not weigh more than forty pounds. It was half-past four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the two men started. The current of the Thirty Mile River was so strong that rarely could they use the paddles. It was out on one bank with a tow-line over the shoulders, stumbling over the rocks, forcing a way through the underbrush, slipping at times and falling into the water, wading often up to the knees and waist; and then, when an insurmountable bluff was encountered, it was into the canoe, out paddles, and a wild and losing dash across the current to the...", "...watching him. The first three hours fell to me. Except the Arizonian I think all of us felt a weight lifted from our hearts. The chief villain was in our hands and the mutiny nipped in the bud. But Bothwell had managed to inject a fly into the ointment of my content. \"We've drawn your sting now,\" Blythe had told him before he left. \"Have you? Bet you a pony I'll be free inside of twenty-four hours,\" the Russian had coolly answered. CHAPTER XIII MUTINY It was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day after our encounter with Bothwell--to be more accurate, just after four bells. Miss Wallace and I were sitting under the deck awning, she working in a desultory fashion upon a piece of embroidery while I watched her lazily. The languorous day was of the loveliest. It invited to idleness, made repudiation of work a virtue.

That night there was a large dinner party, and, unluckily, I sat opposite to her. Presently she again became drowsy, and had to be led from the table, alleging, to my confusion, that I was again mesmerizing her. So susceptible did she become to my supposed mesmeric influence, which I vainly assured her, as was the case, that I was very far from exercising or attempting to exercise, that it was found expedient to take her up to London. I was out riding <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that she left, and as we passed the railway station, my host, who was riding with me, suggested that, as his friends were just leaving by that train, he would like to alight and take leave of them. I dismounted with him and went on to the platform, and avoided any leave-taking; but unfortunately in walking up and down it seems that I twice passed the window of the young lady's carriage. She was again self-mesmerized, and fell into a sleep which lasted throughout the...", "...been accustomed to rely upon others, and here, haunted by many unavowed and ill-defined alarms and doubts, the disappearance of an active and able friend caused my heart to sink.

It was accompanied, she told me, by a note from Lord Ilbury to my uncle, supporting her request; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I received a message to attend my uncle in his room. 'An invitation from Lady Mary Carysbroke for you and Milly to meet Monica Knollys; have you received it?' asked my uncle, so soon as I was seated. Answered in the affirmative, he continued-- 'Now, Maud Ruthyn, I expect the truth from you; I have been frank, so shall you. Have you ever heard me spoken ill of by Lady Knollys?' I was quite taken aback. I felt my cheeks flushing. I was returning his fierce cold...", "...or any of us to start a fight with them now.\" \"I see all that--I ain't so blind! But--\" Tom did not finish the sentence. Instead he began talking of other things and advised the boys to take every precaution against being treacherously dealt with when they should find Big Buffalo at his own home--the Delaware town. It was a windy, cloudy morning that found Ree and John tramping through the valleys and over the hills of a fine, thickly wooded country toward the Indian village. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they came to a sloping hillside beyond which lay a swampy tract grown up to brush and rushes. Close by was a beautiful little lake and at the opposite side the smoke was rising from the town of the Delaware tribe of Indians. As the boys approached the water, planning to walk around the lake, they were discovered by three Indians in a canoe, which seemed almost to spring out of the water, so quickly did it appear from around a bushy point. The savages headed directly...", "...sounds of conflict; those who were not on duty in the loft remained out of doors watching the soldiers in the distance, and greatly disappointed were we when night came and nothing decisive, so far as we could see, had been done. Next day Pierre pointed out to me as he and I stood overlooking the American lines, that two or three redoubts were being thrown up, and batteries placed in position. Then came that for which we had been hoping and praying--the sounds of conflict. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that our people opened fire upon the enemy with great vigor, and until the end came the earth trembled continuously beneath the heavy detonations, while the smoke of the burning powder hung over us until our throats were parched and smarting. It is impossible for me to set down of my own knowledge all that was done during this seemingly long time by the Britishers, for I saw only a portion of the movements. Often the clouds of smoke prevented me from seeing friend or...", "...by my former journeys through France and Germany and now found ample food in Venice and Milan, whither I at first directed my steps, intending to proceed southwards by slow journies. Above all I was impatient to reach Florence. The marvels I expected to find there caused me to look with indifference on the many beauties of art which I met with on my way thither. Thus I reserved only one day for Bologna, where I took a hasty survey of the churches and galleries in the morning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I drove out to the old convent of St. Michele at Bosco, in order to quiet my conscience by obtaining a complete view of the wonderful old town from the summit of the hill. It was one of the hottest days in midsummer, and though I am generally little affected by any temperature, yet the suffocating air on that occasion completely overpowered and exhausted me. The road which leads from St. Michele back to the town was entirely deserted. Above the walls of the gardens...", "...The snow has fallen fresh on the hills, and it makes me feel that I must soon be seeking shelter at Brantwood and the Thwaite. * * * * * GENOA, _Sunday, 24th September_ (1882). I got your delightful note yesterday at Turin, and it made me wish to run back through the tunnel directly instead of coming on here. But I had a wonderful day, the Alps clear all the morning all round Italy--two hundred miles of them; and then <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> blue waves of the Gulf of Genoa breaking like blue clouds, thunderclouds, under groves of olive and palm. But I wished they were my sparkling waves of Coniston instead, when I read your letter again. What a gay Susie, receiving all the world, like a Queen Susan (how odd one has never heard of a Queen Susan!), only you _are_ so naughty, and you never do tell me of any of those nice girls when they're _coming_, but only when they're gone, and I never shall get glimpse...", "...guards must have been asleep,\" complained Wallace. \"Well, we'll never know, Mr. Wallace. They say that they were thrown from behind and didn't recognize the men who did it. Even if they did, they wouldn't tell who they were, and it's useless to try to make them. The Crees have taken the Lelacs off our hands. They have saved us time and money by ridding us of these vermin. In my opinion we should thank rather than attempt to punish them.\" So Inspector Wallace slowly cooled off and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> went to the Mission to make his daily call on Julie Breton only to be informed, to his surprise, that she could not see him. Meanwhile the condition of the wounded man was unchanged, but Pere Breton faced a problem which he deemed necessary to discuss with his friends Jules Duroc and McCain.

Harold's remains had been temporarily placed in the receiving vault on Lone Mountain. Thorpe went out to the cemetery <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to make the final arrangements for removing them to England. Lone Mountain can be seen from any part of San Francisco; scarcely a house but has a window from which one may receive his daily hint that even Californians are mortal.

The crowd grew to such proportions that the policeman on the beat tried in vain to make it \"move on.\" That bulletin read: \"Lake Tragedy All a Tremendous Hoax: Read the 'Blade's' six o'clock extra.\" At a few minutes before six o'clock Len Spencer began to arrange one of the street windows of the \"Blade\" office....", "...other by an inch, but deeper-chested; the candlelight showed that his eyes were blue, and his mustache and short curly hair were of chestnut color.

'Your sisters are older than yourself?' 'Yes, some years older.' 'Is it long since you went to live apart from them?' 'We have never had a home of our own since I was quite a child.' And, after a moment's hesitation, she went on to give a brief account of her history. Widdowson listened with the closest attention, his lips twitching now and then, his eyes half closed. But for cheek-bones that were too prominent and nostrils...", "...home I went for another two weeks of pleasure, but all good things come to an end, so did that re-enlistment furlough, and the 14th I was summoned back to Worcester, the 15th found me with the regiment and the 18th we started south again. On the way back at Philadelphia the 19th we were given a fine supper at the Cooper Shop Saloon and the next morning at Baltimore we were treated to a fine breakfast at the Union Relief Association rooms. Proceeding on our way we arrived at Annapolis <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of March 25th. We went into camp and stayed there until we started to join the Army of the Potomac at the Wilderness. After the fine times we had had at home, ordinary camp life was decidedly dull. Troops were arriving daily and we soon learned the 9th Army Corps was assembling there preparatory to joining General Grant's army on the Rapidan. Every fellow had left a girl behind him. Writing letters was freely indulged in by all, and the mails were loaded with...", "...some fragmentary organizations at the White House, notified me that the place was about to be attacked. I had previously sent an advance party with orders to move swiftly toward the cannonading and report to me by couriers the actual condition of affairs. From this party I soon learned that there was no occasion to push our jaded animals, since the crisis, if there had been one, was over and the enemy repulsed, so the increased gait was reduced to a leisurely march that took us late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to the north bank of the Pamunkey, opposite Abercrombie's camp. When I got to the river the enemy was holding the bluffs surrounding the White House farm, having made no effort to penetrate General Abercrombie's line or do him other hurt than to throw a few shells among the teamsters there congregated. Next day Gregg's division crossed the Pamunkey dismounted, and Torbert's crossed mounted. As soon as the troops were over, Gregg, supported by Merritt's brigade,...", "...crime and fled from justice. Some were cultivators who, having been unable to pay their taxes, had deserted their land and taken to the woods. All committed depredations, and traders coming into the town from the Shan states, or from the country where rubies and emeralds were found, always travelled in caravans for mutual protection. At times levies were called out, and many of these marauders were killed. Stanley, then, had hit upon nothing definite when the officer returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and, in reply to the latter's question, he acknowledged at once that the only thing he could see was to take to the forest, until the active search for him had ceased. \"You would find it difficult to maintain yourself.

The puffy-cheeked boy was just like one of those sturdy Tuscan urchins, but the maiden was of finer ware, like a madonna. So Dick thought: although Chatty had never called forth such fine imaginations before. They all walked home together very peacefully in a tender quiet, which lasted until the Eustace Thynnes came back with their remarks upon everybody. And <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Dick told Mrs. Warrender that he must go over and see Wilberforce at Underwood. There were various things he had to talk to Wilberforce about, and he would be back to dinner, which was late on Sunday to leave time for the evening church-going. Chatty had her Sunday-school, so it was as well for him to go. He set out walking, having first engaged the people at the Plough Inn to send a dog-cart to bring him back. It was a very quiet unexciting road, rather dusty, with...", "...had not used her imagination wholly. \"I am glad you had nothing to do with it,\" she concluded, walking slowly away toward the kitchen end of the house. \"And I hope your hand will soon be well.\" \"That's right,\" said Long Bill. \"I didn't have nothin' to do with it.

It was four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day. School had been dismissed and the dozen children of various sizes were straggling homeward. Hope stood beside her horse patiently waiting for the twins to go, but they seemed in no particular hurry. She listened absent-mindedly to the boys' conversation. \"An' another thing about this pony o' mine, he'll never slack up on a rope,\" continued Dan. \"Once you've got a rope on a steer he'll never budge till the cinch busts off the saddle. He'll just sit...", "...our running tackle bent. It'll moderate before the evening, and if it does we can work all night. Will your Rile Highnes' be ready to work all night?\" \"I shall be ready whenever your High Mightiness is.\" The captain gave a gruff laugh. \"Dammy, you're the right sort!\" he muttered, looking aloft at the rigging with that contempt for foreign tackle which is essentially the privilege of the British sailor. Cable gave certain orders, announced that he would send four men on board <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to bend the running tackle \"ship-shape and Bristol fashion,\" and refused to remain on board the _Olaf_ for luncheon. \"We've got a bit of steak,\" he said, conclusively, and clambered over the side into his boat. In confirmation of this statement the odor of fried onions was borne on the breeze a few minutes later from the small steamer to the large one. The men from Sunderland came on board during the afternoon--men who, as Captain Cable had stated, had only one...", "...a tent was erected in front of each ambulant abode, and inside this tent could be seen, through the holes in the canvas, glittering things which excited the envy or the curiosity of the village youngsters.

Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> there was a crowd on the green. From every neighboring village the farmers arrived, shaken along with their wives and children in the two-wheeled open chars-a-bancs, which rattled along, swaying like cradles. They unharnessed at their friends' houses and the farmyards were filled with strange-looking traps, gray, high, lean, crooked, like long-clawed creatures from the depths of the sea. And each family, with the youngsters in front and the grown-up ones behind, came...", "...are we going?\" David asked. \"To the Russian lines.\" \"Russian?\" \"The enemy. The people who started the war. They dropped the first radiation bombs. They began all this.\" The boy nodded. His face showed no expression. \"I'm an American,\" Hendricks said. There was no comment.

Hendricks built a fire in a hollow between some slabs of concrete. He cleared the weeds away and heaped up bits of wood. The Russians' lines were not very far ahead.

And the clouds of rolling ash that blew and drifted with the wind, settling over the weeds...", "...morning all was quiet. As before, they were attacked as soon as they moved forward. No serious opposition was offered to the columns of spearmen, but the light armed troops who covered the advance and formed a connection between the columns were exposed to incessant attack. The third day the Romans, after another disturbed night, again advanced. This time they met with no opposition, and as they moved cautiously forward, wondered uneasily what was the meaning of this silence. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they learned. They had advanced, each man carrying three days' provisions with him. Beric, being aware that this was their custom, had during the night led his men some distance down the hillside, and making a detour occupied before morning the ground the Romans had passed over. At midday a great convoy of baggage animals, laden with provisions, came along. It extended over a great length, and came in straggling order, the men leading their animals, and making their...", "...least was revived in him--his love for things beautiful. \"Where did they come from?\" he asked. The nurse smiled. \"A lady heft them yesterday,\" she said. \"She drove up and stayed for some time with the doctor. I believe that she is coming again to-day.\" Douglas made no remark. Only the nurse smiled as she noticed him linger a little over his dressing, and look for the first time with interest at the clothes which had been sent in for him. Towards midday he grew restless. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> there was a soft tap at the door. \"May I come in?\" The nurse opened the door. There was a rustle of draperies, and to Douglas it seemed as though the room was suddenly full of wonderful colour. A new life flowed in his veins. It was Emily de Reuss who came towards him with outstretched hands. CHAPTER XIII THE FIRST TASTE OF FAME At first he scarcely recognised her. He had seen her last in furs, to-day she seemed like a delicate dream of Springtime. She...", "...exhausted and for a while no sound was heard in or about the house save the barking of our great dog.

I ascended another of the heights in the Gawler range to-day, but could obtain no clear view from it, the weather being hazy. Ridge behind ridge still appeared to rise to the north, beyond the front one under which we were travelling; and several salt lakes were seen among the hills at intervals. The rock of which the hills were composed was now changed from a porphoritic granite to a...", "...altogether. It shamed him terribly to think of his momentary panic; he cursed himself for a coward, and dug his clenched fists into both pockets. But even as he stood there, withering himself with self-scorn, he could not help hoping that his aunt and uncle would find it convenient to go to Paris soon. That would leave him free to take his own chances by remaining, to be near Lorraine. For it did not occur to him that he might leave Morteyn as long as Lorraine stayed. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when he lighted a pipe and walked out to the road, where the smooth macadam no longer bore the slightest trace of wheel or hoof, and nobody could have imagined that part of an army corps had passed there the night before. He felt lonely and a little despondent, and he walked along the road to the shrine of Our Lady of Morteyn and sat down at her naked stone feet. And as he sat there smoking, twirling his shooting-cap in his hands, without the least warning a...", "...till his eyeballs were almost hidden beneath their thick lashes, so regarding me for minutes together with a delightful simulation of intelligence, yet with that peculiar wistful affection his master had himself exhibited at first sight of me.

And presently after I heard from afar his high, melancholy \"cooee,\" and the crack of his thong <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> air as he hastened out to his charges.

She would rest upon this till the contrary should be proved; proved more effectually than by a cynical intimation of Osmond's. Such a resolution, however, brought her this evening but little peace, for her soul was haunted with terrors which crowded to the foreground of thought as quickly as a place was made for them.

That impression came back to her from time to time, and now she wondered it had never come before.

It was very well to undertake to give him a proof of loyalty; the real fact was that the...", "...ARMISTICE--THE WAR OVER The Allies continued to be masters of the situation on the Flanders front. October 17-18, 1918, Zeebrugge, the only submarine base on the coast remaining to the Germans after they were driven out of Ostend, and Blankenberghe, a port four miles to the southwest, were occupied. The French gained possession of Thielt and advanced a mile east of the town. Southeast of Douai the British occupied a number of villages.

In 1870, after the investment of Metz, Rheims witnessed the departure of the army formed by MacMahon at Chalons-sur-Marne, for the relief of Marshal Bazaine.

To \"do\" the A.S.C. is a virtuous deed. So we have dined well lately, though at the present time of writing I am rather tired of apricot preserve. [Illustration: On Pass.

Lord Kitchener was informed that the Meeting representing the two Republics had delegated Commandant General Louis Botha, Chief Commandant C. R. de Wet, General J. H. de la Rey, General J. C. Smuts, and General J. B. M. Hertzog to confer with the representatives of the British Government, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of Saturday, May 17, the Governments received a reply from Lord Kitchener that he and Lord Milner, on behalf of the British Government, were prepared to meet the Commission, who were requested to proceed to Pretoria immediately for that purpose. The Commission left Vereeniging that same evening for Pretoria, where they arrived at 8 o'clock p.m. They were accommodated in \"Park zicht,\" the residence of Mr. Carl Rood, corner of Mare and van der Walt Streets.

There was no path and no open country--only a dense forest, obstructed with undergrowth and fallen timber. The sun was very hot when it could reach us through the foliage; not a breath of air stirred, and after we crossed the Mishawl, not a drop of water was to be had until we got down to low ground again. We toiled from early morning until three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before we reached the summit. As the doctor had taken whisky instead of water in his canteen, he found it necessary to apply to the other members of the party to quench his thirst, and our canteens were speedily empty. The doctor sought relief in whisky, but it only aggravated his thirst, and he poured out the contents of his canteen. The severe exertion required for the ascent brought on painful cramps in his legs, and at one time, about the middle of the day, I...", "...the \"rights\" of political offenders was a world that was growing too complex for him. The Gadfly, for his part, had returned to the fortress in a state of nervous excitement bordering on hysteria. The meeting with Montanelli had strained his endurance almost to breaking-point; and his final brutality about the variety show had been uttered in sheer desperation, merely to cut short an interview which, in another five minutes, would have ended in tears. Called up for interrogation <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day, he did nothing but go into convulsions of laughter at every question put to him; and when the Governor, worried out of all patience, lost his temper and began to swear, he only laughed more immoderately than ever. The unlucky Governor fumed and stormed and threatened his refractory prisoner with impossible punishments; but finally came, as James Burton had come long ago, to the conclusion that it was mere waste of breath and temper to argue with a...", "...did seem strange to lie there alongside Staten Island all that day, with New York town so nigh at hand and yet so impossible to reach. For whether he desired to escape or no, Barnaby True could not but observe that both he and the young lady were so closely watched that they might as well have been prisoners, tied hand and foot and laid in the hold, so far as any hope of getting away was concerned. All that day there was a deal of mysterious coming and going aboard the brigantine, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a sailboat went up to the town, carrying the captain, and a great load covered over with a tarpaulin in the stern. What was so taken up to the town Barnaby did not then guess, but the boat did not return again till about sundown.

Far on <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of a summer day, I sat at tea with an acquaintance who dwells in the fields outside the town of Heywood. We had spent the forenoon in visiting Heywood Hall, and rambling among its woods, and through a pleasant clough, which winds along the northern base of the eminence on which that old mansion stands. We lingered over the afternoon meal, talking of the past and present of the district around us. We speculated upon the ancient aspect of the country, and the condition...", "...two of dry ground.\" \"One can imagine it,\" she laughed. \"Well, you have to face the gale and fog, while we try not to be beaten by Jefferson and to meet our bills.

It seemed to be all work and anxious planning with her; there was something pathetic in the keen pleasure she took in her rare holiday. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they dropped anchor in a rock-walled cove with a beach of white shingle on which sparkling wavelets broke. Dark firs climbed the rugged heights above, and their scent drifted off across the clear, green water.

His expression, however, was anxious as he served the first course to his guests. \"I've done...", "...the line of no variation.

The shrewd eyes of the old cattleman appraised him. Already he guessed some of the secrets of this young man's heart. Dave swung to the left into the hills so as to get away from the beaten trails after they had crossed the pass. He rode slowly, with a careful eye upon his companion. Frequently he stopped to rest in spite of Roy's protests. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they came to a little mountain ranch owned by a nester who had punched cattle for Dave in the old days. Now he was doing a profitable business himself in other men's calves. He had started with a branding-iron and a flexible conscience.

Seeming to recognize her all at once he made another bow and said, \"Ah, pardon me but I see I have just had the honor of serving Miss Jones, whom I met on the train a few days ago.\" Hardly knowing just what to do, she thanked him and hesitated, but he was not slow to turn the tide in his favor and was soon chatting in such a very agreeable way about the many scenes that she soon forgot all doubts as to propriety.

I am so glad you like her, Neville,\" and Edna looked very pleased. Mr. Sinclair left on the following morning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Miss Shelton arrived. She was a pleasant-looking woman, with a tranquil face and silvery-gray hair, and Bessie was prepossessed in her favor at once. She was evidently warmly attached to her old pupil, and the news of her reconciliation with her lover filled her with unbounded satisfaction, and her congratulations were very hearty. \"I have lived a great many years in the world,\" she said, \"but I have never seen two better young men than Mr. Sinclair and Mr....", "...were fixed on my father's paintings, I could see nothing but storm-lashed billows, wrecking ships, and pale, drowning mariners.

He usually painted in the mornings as well as Julian; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we rode, or walked as inclination prompted, and the evenings were devoted to sewing, conversation, and music.

The master of the \"Lord Hyde\" reported[105] that on his passage from Falmouth to New York, he saw at four o'clock in the morning of that day a ship and a brig three or four leagues distant. They spoke to one another, and then gave chase to the packet. The ship fell out of sight, but the brig followed hard, and at four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> came up with the packet and began to fire, at the same time running a red English ensign to the topmast head. The master of the packet, seeing no chance for escape, shortened sail and prepared for action. The brig came up alongside, replacing the English ensign by a flag of thirteen stripes with a small union in it, and without more ado poured into the packet a broadside from eight carriage guns, and a number of swivels and small arms.

At four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we at length set sail. The time had passed rapidly enough with me, for there was a great deal of bustle around this canal. Barques came and departed, took in or discharged cargo; long processions of camels moved to and fro with their drivers to fetch and carry goods; the soldiers passed by, to the sound of military music, to exercise in the neighbouring square; there was continually something new to see, so that when four o'clock arrived, I could not imagine what had...", "...an innumerable quantity of bats issued from the clefts of the rock, and hovered around our hammocks.

About four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we landed at the Conucos de Siquita, the Indian plantations of the mission of San Fernando. The good people wished to detain us among them, but we continued to go up against the current, which ran at the rate of five feet a second, according to a measurement I made by observing the time that a floating body took to go down a given distance.

Like the bride, she wears white gloves and carries flowers. If the wedding is held <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> or evening, at home, the maid of honor's gown is less formal.

Seventeen persons were missing, chiefly from the steerage. Twenty-nine seriously injured were under the doctor's care. Some of them would not recover. A hundred or more persons suffered from shock, bruises, cuts and exposure, but only a few of them required or demanded attention. In spite of their injuries, they fell to with the spirit that makes for true...", "...making her fortune were worth the risk.

Cherrie and Miller also went in them, because they had found that it was very difficult to collect birds, and especially mammals, when we were moving every day, packing up early each morning and the mule-train arriving late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> or not until nightfall.

Directly she went on: \"I found out about it the very day of the marriage. We were married in the morning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a man came over from Vancouver who told me that Mr. Seabrook had a wife, and family of children, in a certain town in Ohio.\" Another pause followed, while she seemed to be recalling the very emotions of that time. \"Vancouver?\" I said: \"that is on the Columbia River.\" \"Yes; I was living in Portland at that time.\" In reply to my glance of surprise, she changed the scene of her story to an earlier date. \"Mr. Greyfield had always wanted to come to California,...", "...so gloomy as when I returned to him, and the black dog was not chased away by my praises of Don Cipriano. He cheered up, however, at the prospect of sightseeing with the Cherub and Pilar; the Cherub martyred; Pilar joyous in the thought of showing off the Murillos and Velasquez which she adored. They did the Armeria and picture galleries all the morning, until they were drooping with fatigue; waggled back in a dilapidated cab, clamouring for their lunch and my tidings; departed again <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to finish what they had left undone. Meanwhile I had heard nothing; and the day, spent in waiting for Don Cipriano or for some bit of gossip picked up by Ropes, was long. But five o'clock and Don Cipriano came together. Carmona had been to the club. The Conde de Roldan had not spoken to him, but the Duke had talked to another man, a motoring friend of the King's. Perhaps, with few others, would the Duke have been so expansive. He had said, \"I'm only in Madrid for...", "...with beautiful gray moss which had looped itself from branch to branch and hung suspended in delicate streamers yards in length. The forest was choked with underbrush and a dense growth of dwarf bamboo, and the hundreds of fallen logs, carpeted with bronze moss, made ideal conditions for small mammal collecting. However, as all the species would probably be similar to those we had obtained on the Snow Mountain, we did not feel that it was worth while stopping to trap. At four-thirty <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we camped upon a beautiful hill in a pine forest which was absolutely devoid of underbrush, and where the floor was thinly overlaid with brown pine needles. Although the Moso hunter, who acted as our guide, assured us that the river was only three miles away, it proved to be more than fifteen, and we did not reach the ferry until half past one the next afternoon. We were continually annoyed, as every traveler in China is, by the inaccuracy of the natives, and...", "...of the latter stream, at the crossing known as Papin's Ferry. Here the semicivilized Indians and traders had a single rude ferryboat, a scow operated in part by setting poles, in part by the power of the stream against a cable. The noncommittal Indians would give no counsel as to fording. They had ferry hire to gain. Word passed that there were other fords a few miles higher up. A general indecision existed, and now the train began to pile up on the south bank of the river. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the scout, Jackson, came riding back to the herd where Banion was at work, jerking up his horse in no pleased frame of mind. \"Will,\" said he, \"leave the boys ride now an' come on up ahead. We need ye.\" \"What's up?\" demanded Banion. \"Anything worse?\" \"Yes. The old fool's had a row over the ferryboat. Hit'd take two weeks to git us all over that way, anyhow.

In the great battle of the 4th of June, Austrians and French numbered respectively about 60,000 men; no Piedmontese were engaged till the evening, when a battalion of Bersaglieri arrived. The Imperial Guard, with which was Napoleon, had to bear the brunt of the fight for four hours, and ran a good chance of being annihilated; not a brilliant proof of French generalship, but happily the Austrians also committed grave mistakes. MacMahon's arrival at five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> prevented a catastrophe, and the fighting, which continued far into the night, was from this moment attended by results on the whole advantageous to the French. Not much more can be said. Magenta was very like a drawn battle. The Austrians are calculated to have lost 10,000 men, the French between 4,000 and 5,000. It was expected that the Austrians would renew the attack, but on the 5th, Gyulai ordered the retreat, which was the last order he had the opportunity of...", "...rendered pleasing by good humour. And Az\u00edzeh was childless, a sad reproach in these lands, where progeny forms a man's wealth and a woman's honour. The next day was perforce a halt, as had been expected; moreover, rains and tornadoes were a reasonable pretext for nursing the headache. The 21st was also wet and stormy, so Nimrod hid himself and was not to be found. Then the balivernes began. One Asini, a Mpongwe from the Plateau, offered to show me a huge gorilla near his village; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he was confronted with \"Young Prince,\" and he would have blushed scarlet if he could. But he assured me plaintively that he must lie to live, and, after all, la prudence des souris n'est pas celle des chats. Before dark, Forteune appeared, and swore that he had spent the day in the forest, he had shot at a gorilla, but the gun missed fire--of course he had slept in a snug hut. This last determined me to leave Mb\u00e1t\u00e1; the three Kru-men had returned; one of them was...", "...line urged upon him. About two o'clock in the afternoon General Butler was forced back to the line the enemy had withdrawn from in the morning. General Wright, with his two divisions, joined General Butler on the forenoon of the 17th, the latter still holding with a strong picket-line the enemy's works. But instead of putting these divisions into the enemy's works to hold them, he permitted them to halt and rest some distance in the rear of his own line. Between four and five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the enemy attacked and drove in his pickets and re-occupied his old line. On the night of the 20th and morning of the 21st a lodgment was effected by General Butler, with one brigade of infantry, on the north bank of the James, at Deep Bottom, and connected by pontoon-bridge with Bermuda Hundred. On the 19th, General Sheridan, on his return from his expedition against the Virginia Central Railroad, arrived at the White House just as the enemy's cavalry was about...", "...pushed its innocent way into the maw of the entire rebel army. We had to fight first and think afterward. Price had hours to choose his positions and, incidentally, he chose our position also. We didn't have time to change it. \"Rapidity of movement and surprise are the life and soul of the strategical offensive.\" That maxim reads well but, in practice, it is important to provide against being surprised by the other fellow before you spring your surprise on him. For several miles <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 19th of September the advance of Rosecrans' column was warmly contested. The enemy's sharp-shooters occupied every point of vantage, making the last five miles a steady contest. The cavalry had long ago been driven in. A few companies formed an advance skirmish line only a short distance from the main column. Near the front of the column marched the Eleventh Ohio Battery. The men knew that an engagement was imminent but their immediate front was unknown and...", "...rest, generally through the woods, but always keeping near the coast unless for a shorter cut across the base of some little peninsula. Elinor stood it well and enjoyed with Pats the excitement of discovery. After a long nooning they pushed on until nearly sunset. When they halted for the night both explorers were still in good condition; but the next morning, in starting off, each confessed to a stiffness in the lower muscles. This disappeared, however, after an hour's walking. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of this second day's march they stood upon the top of the hill which, from a distance, had promised a commanding view. But they found, as so often happens to every kind of climber, that another hill, still higher and farther on, was the one to be attained. So they pushed ahead. Just before reaching the summit of this final hill Pats halted. \"Now comes a critical moment. What do you think we shall see?\" Elinor shook her head sadly. \"I am prepared for the worst; for...", "...shall be there with fifty pounds in gold.\" \"Supposing he fails to stop or send the boat?\" \"Then he will not get his fifty pounds,\" retorted Don Pedro. \"The man is a rascal, and deserves prison rather than reward, but since the mummy was stolen by him thirty years back, he alone can prove my ownership.\" \"But why take all this trouble?\" argued the baronet. \"I can buy the mummy from Braddock.\" \"No,\" said Don Pedro. \"I have a right to my own property.\" Random lingered until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and until darkness fell, as he was anxious to see Donna Inez. But she did not appear until late. Meanwhile Archie Hope put in an appearance, having come to see Don Pedro with an account of his interview with Widow Anne. Before coming to the inn he had called on Professor Braddock, and from him had heard all about the wickedness of Mrs. Jasher. His surprise was very great. \"I should not have believed it,\" he declared. \"Poor woman!\" \"Ah,\" said Random, rather pleased,...", "...it was. We had a crowded house and were well received. We were to return to Victoria the following day. The snow was deep and it was cold and blowing hard. Unable to secure an express wagon, we improvised a sleigh and the boys put our things into it and dragged the sleigh to the depot. We boarded the Northern Pacific and started up the Sound. Snow everywhere. The scenery was beautiful. Mount Baker was a lovely sight, just like one solid piece of ice. We arrived in Seattle at one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and went directly to the Cosmopolitan. Let me quote from my diary. Saturday, March 11th: \"Our entertainment last night was given in the cabin of a steamer which had been fashioned into a music hall and it proved a fine place to sing in and we had a packed house in spite of snow and rain. We met with a great reception and one encore after another had to be given. Sunday, 12th. We started for Steillacoom on the steamer Alida and arrived early and were taken to the...", "...which consisted of \"The Life of David Livingstone\" and a bound number of \"The Gospel Tribune.\" And there were frequent visits and long evenings spent about a cosy fire, when the Morrisons, or the Grants, or the Rileses, dropped in to while away the time.

At four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Harris kissed his wife an affectionate farewell, hitched his horses to the sleigh, and started out posthaste for Plainville. The sun, hanging low to the western horizon, was banded by a great ring of yellow and gold, bulging into two dull reflected glows at either side. A ground-drift of snow whipped keenly across the hard crust, and the north-west wind had a rip to it, but overhead the sky was clear and the blue amazingly deep. Harris drove by way of the Morrisons,...", "...the people poured out from every gate of the garden, until the last loiterer passed and the gendarmes closed the portals for the night. Before the lamps were lighted along the Rue de Rivoli and in the great square of the Revolution, the garden was left to the silence of its statues and its thousand memories. I often used to wonder, as I looked through the iron railing at nightfall, what might go on there and whether historic shades might not flit about in the ghostly walks. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 18th of June, after a long walk through the galleries of the Louvre, and excessively weary, I sat down to rest on a secluded bench in the southern grove of the garden; hidden from view by the tree-trunks. Where I sat I could see the old men and children in that sunny flower-garden, La Petite Provence, and I could see the great fountain-basin facing the Porte du Pont-Tournant. I must have heard the evening drumming, which was the signal for me to quit the garden;...", "...on the other, to evade the payment of the high duties imposed, are the true origin of that _regime_.

There is a survey at 6 o'clock in the morning, when the officers take their accounts and gauges, and make calculations which occupy several hours. At 10 o'clock they again survey, going over the whole premises, where they continue a considerable time, frequently till the succeeding officer comes on duty; at 2 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> another survey takes place, but not by the same people; at 6 in the evening the survey is repeated; at 10 there comes another survey by an officer who had not been engaged in any of the previous surveys of that day.

In addition to these regular inspections, the distilleries are subject to frequent and uncertain visits of the surveyor and general surveyor. \"We are never,\" says Mr. Smith, the eminent distiller of...", "...if in some measure relieved by the discovery. \"I must take after my uncle.

Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they had a broad hint of how near the end was. The sweepers dropped their brooms and began carrying fire buckets full of water. They placed one or more near every bearing all over the elevator. The men who were quickest to understand explained to the slower ones what the precaution meant, and every man had his eye on the nearest pulley to see when it would begin to turn. But Bannon was not going to begin till he was ready. He had inspected the whole job four times...", "...to camp with us!\" cried Sam, and this was done, and then the youngest Rover took it upon his shoulders to make a huckleberry roly-poly pudding, \"just like Aunt Martha's.\" Perhaps the pudding was not as good as those turned out by Mrs. Rover, but it was good enough, and the boys ate it to the last scrap. Then Fred tried his hand one morning at flapjacks and these they also ate with a relish. \"I dink I makes you some Cherman coffee cake alretty,\" said Hans, on the day following, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he set to work. Soon he had several kettles, pans and pails filled with flour and water and other things. His hands were full of a pasty mess, and he had some of the stuff on his nose. \"How are you getting on?\" asked Dick, when he saw the German youth stop and stare around in perplexity. \"I dink I need anudder dish,\" said Hans, slowly. \"Great Scott, Hans!

Mrs. Beale could not speak, but she stroked his head once or twice in acknowledgment of his great kindness. Then more tears came because he _was_ so very kind; and finally she was obliged to go to her own room to recover herself. As the day wore on, however, she became reassured. Edith seemed much refreshed by her sleep, and, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the three ladies came from the castle to call upon her, bringing Angelica with them, she quite roused up. \"What, Angelica a grown up young lady in a long dress!\" she exclaimed. \"But where is Diavolo?\" \"We had a slight difference of opinion this morning,\" Angelica answered stiffly. \"Dear me! that is a new thing!\" Mrs. Beale commented. \"No, it is not,\" Angelica contradicted, bridling visibly. \"Only, when we were younger we used to--settle our...", "...side of the law for the first time, and felt he owed a duty to Downy, whom he regarded as almost as great a man as Sam Sagacious.

The detective returned to the township <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to prosecute the search for Ephraim, of whom nothing had yet been heard. In the presence of his mother and Mrs. Hardy and Harry, Dick faced the officer to tell his story; but he found it hard to begin. 'Well, my lad,' said Downy, 'you're going to tell all you know?'

At four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he would leave for Cincinnati. By taking the train he would miss a bit of scenery at Cumberland, which he had hoped to see. This could not be helped, however, for by the train he would be set down in Cincinnati in good season for the important one-day session of a committee, the primary object of the trip. To be sure, he would have to miss another important committee meeting at home, unless he should forego the Washington stop.

The Confederates, after discovering this advantageous position taken by Sherman, fought desperately <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to regain it, but were finally repulsed. While this was going on, General Hooker, with a division of Sherman's army, was making a desperate struggle for the capture of Lookout Mountain, whose rugged crests towered above the clouds.

Brown came to bid him farewell, full of gladness and warm congratulation, which he longed to send to his friend, but which Tom only received with hasty, half-comprehending assents. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he reached Stoneborough, found no one come in, and sat down in the fire-light, where, for all his impatience, fatigue had made him drop asleep, when he was roused by Gertrude's voice, exclaiming, 'Here really is Tom come, as you said he would, without writing.

In the dawn he awakened Holroyd. \"Lord!\" said Holroyd, \"what now?\" \"I have decided,\" said the captain. \"What--to land?\" said Holroyd, sitting up brightly. \"No!\"...", "...and the stale stench of rum. Ribald songs, quarrelling, and blasphemy made a veritable pandemonium of the place. I passed quietly through it to the sick man's bunk, and found him--dead!

Here, at any rate, there was quiet and decorum, while all that could be done for the poor sufferer (not much, from ignorance of how he was injured) was done.

This was the third night since that one when Justin had failed to appear, and there had been no word from him in the interim.

However, nobody at the company knew anything of Justin's movements, except that he had left the office rather early the afternoon before, and had been seen to take a car going up-town. It was presumable that he had been called suddenly out of town, and had sent some word to Mrs. Alexander that had miscarried.

His fighting blood rose to full tide, and he gave his orders with the steadiness and commanding force of a born soldier. The officers hastened to their respective positions.

Men marched to their places; cannon were wheeled into position, and soon enough the firing began in good earnest. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a rumor of Clark's approach had gone abroad through the village; but not a French lip breathed it to a friend of the British. The creoles were loyal to the cause of freedom; moreover, they cordially hated Hamilton, and their hearts beat high at the prospect of a change in masters at the fort. Every cabin had its hidden gun and supply of ammunition, despite the order to disarm issued by Hamilton.

It grew murky and hot every moment, and when we reached Fairtown the air was black and sultry with the coming storm. Charles left me at the little hotel, and returned so late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that we decided not to wait for the shower. Two men led Aspen to the door.

The royalists approached the town about 2 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> from the south-west, and at once delivered an attack at several quarters; but after about half an hour's hard fighting at close quarters the first assault was beaten off. The royalists state that they lost 200 men in this repulse. Colonel Rigby sent out of the town a troop of horse to stave off the second attack, but these were defeated. The Earl of Derby in person led the second attack, having requested Prince Rupert to allow him for this purpose two companies of his...", "...days must in all probability elapse before Don Agostino might be able to find a safe opportunity of conveying the letter and ring he had intrusted to him to Bianca. When, therefore, he found on his table, on returning to Palazzo Acorari as usual for breakfast, a notice from the post-office informing him that a registered packet addressed to him was lying at the central office, he did not suppose for a moment that the said packet had come from Montefiano. Indeed, it was not until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that he went to San Silvestro in order to get the packet, as he had some work to do at home which he was anxious to complete. His heart gave a sudden leap when he recognized Don Agostino's handwriting on the registered envelope. The arcade running round the court-yard and garden of palms at San Silvestro, thronged as it was with people asking for their correspondence at the _poste-restante_, with soldiers and men of business, priests and peasants, was certainly not...", "...declining sun. Next morning they set forth again as Mallard had proposed, their baggage packed on a donkey, a guide with them to lead the way over the mountains to the other shore. A long climb, and at the culminating point of the ridge they rested to look the last on Naples; thenceforward their faces were set to the far blue hills of Calabria. \"Yonder lies Paestum,\" said Mallard, pointing to the dim plain beyond the Gulf of Salerno; and his companion's eyes were agleam. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they reached the coast at Positano, and thence took boat for Amalfi. Elgar was like one possessed at his first sight of the wonderful old town, nested in its mountain gorge, overlooked by wild crags; this relic saved from the waste of mediaeval glory. When they had put up at an inn less frequented and much cheaper than the \"Cappuccini,\" he would not rest until he had used the last hour of sunlight in clambering about the little maze of streets, or rather of mountain...", "...the blankets and into the fire. Children may frequently be seen with bruises and scars which they carry as mementoes of some tesvino feast. I know one man who had no hair on one side of his head, having when a child been a victim of such an accident. But seldom, if ever, is a child allowed to become fatally injured. Taking it all in all, it is a good-natured, jolly, silly crowd, out for a good time and enjoying themselves. All are good friends, and familiarity becomes unlimited. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> those still able to walk start on their way home. Rarely, however, can they reach their domiciles, if these are any distance off, before nature enforces her rights; and the track is strewn with men and women, who, overcome with the effects of their spree, have lain down wherever they happened to be, to sleep themselves sober. Tarahumare society has not yet advanced far enough to see anything disgraceful in debauches of this kind, which, if viewed from their standpoint,...", "...I don't think I can ever let you go again,\" Mrs. Morrison said. It was after lunch, and Frances had gone to get ready for a walk with her father. \"Then, will you go to New York with me next week?\" asked her husband. \"I may have to stand that. It will depend on how soon we must leave here permanently. Jack, there is one rather strange thing I must tell you--\" but just here Frances danced in, and her mother did not finish her sentence. When they returned from their walk late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they stopped in the shop for a moment to speak to Mr. Clark. Peterkin was the only person to be seen, but the door into the study stood open, and, supposing the Spectacle Man was there, Frances and her father entered. Some one was standing before the mantel looking up at the portrait of Washington, and Frances gave an exclamation of surprise, for it was not the optician, but, of all persons, Mrs. Marvin! It was not very light, and for a second she thought she must...", "...delay, were permitted to open fire on them. Thunder from the clear, blue sky could not have surprised them more. They sprang to their feet, and stood not on the order of their going, but left quickly, every man for himself, and soon \"their tents were all silent, their banners alone,\" like Sennacherib's of old, and there was a deserted camp all this day. The enemy appeared this morning to be moving permanently to our left, and the firing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> extended farther in that direction, Toward dark I opened fire on the enemy's batteries; also again at 11 P.M. 23d. Yesterday Gen. Cockrell had fourteen men wounded. During the night the enemy removed their tents, wagons, etc., from their abandoned encampment that was shelled yesterday, and the place looks desolate. At 10 A.M., when all was quiet on the mountain, the enemy commenced a rapid fire from guns put in position during...", "...in my ears, I was almost tempted to believe that everybody I heard speak had lost their senses. Clearly perceiving that there was some mystery, which no one thought proper to explain to me, I patiently awaited the event, depending upon my integrity and innocence, and thinking myself happy, let the persecution which awaited me be what it would, to be called to the honor of suffering in the cause of truth. Far from being afraid and concealing myself, I went every day to the castle, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> took my usual walk. On the eighth of June, the evening before the order was concluded on, I walked in company with two professors of the oratory, Father Alamanni and Father Mandard. We carried to Champeaux a little collation, which we ate with a keen appetite. We had forgotten to bring glasses, and supplied the want of them by stalks of rye, through which we sucked up the wine from the bottle, piquing ourselves upon the choice of large tubes to vie with each other in...", "...Egyptian tricks won't answer in England.\" \"You're a raving lunatic,\" said Bellingham. \"All right. You just remember what I say, for you'll find that I'll be better than my word.\" The door slammed, and Smith went fuming up to his chamber, where he locked the door upon the inside, and spent half the night in smoking his old briar and brooding over the strange events of the evening. Next morning Abercrombie Smith heard nothing of his neighbour, but Harrington called upon him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to say that Lee was almost himself again. All day Smith stuck fast to his work, but in the evening he determined to pay the visit to his friend Dr. Peterson upon which he had started upon the night before. A good walk and a friendly chat would be welcome to his jangled nerves.

In Newgate, as he knew he had no favour to expect, he prepared himself for the awful change which was about to take place. He had dined with his sister on the day on which the murder was committed, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he wrote a letter to her husband, Mr. Booth, an eminent attorney, informing him of his intention to destroy himself, and desiring him to sell what effects he had, in order to pay a small debt which he owed; but it appears that the letter was not despatched, as it was found in his pocket.

Jenks kept his wrinkled, leather face to the northward, looking steadily for a sail, but the other sailors glanced aft several times, and I noticed the strange glare of the eye which tells of the hungry animal. Some of these men had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours. One big, heavy-looking young sailor glanced back several times from the clew of his eye at the girl sitting aft. But I fixed my gaze upon him so steadily that he shifted his seat and looked forward. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> some of the men insisted on eating the beef, and it was served to them. No ill effects followed, so all hands took their ration. This satisfied them for the time being, but I knew the thirst which must surely follow. I had been adrift in an open boat before in the Pacific. There had been sixteen men at the start, and at the end of four weeks of horror seven had been picked up to tell a tale which would make the blood curdle. The memory of this made me sick with fear and...", "...as if tearing herself.) MRS. CLANDON (mildly). My dear: what is the matter? What-- (The waiter enters with the tea tray.) WAITER (balmily).

So much backing and filling, so much talking about bagging that old fox, Stonewall Jackson, soon became a matter of ridicule and all our dependence was placed in General Reno. August 28. We started early in the morning in the direction of Manassas Junction, reaching there about noon to find it had been burned. The storehouse and the trains of cars, all loaded with supplies, were in smouldering ruins. A few dead rebels lying about was the only redeeming feature. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we started for Bull Run and when we camped in the evening, we were under the impression that we were in the immediate neighborhood of the old Bull Run battlefield. August 29. We started early in the morning, passed through Auburn and headed direct for the firing line; it sounded as if a battle was under way. A lot of paroled prisoners passed us going to the rear as we moved along. We soon reached a high hill to the top of which we climbed. We had a fine view of the...", "...crazy all the time he was there; and if it was indeed true that he had stumbled upon a stranded ancient hulk, that very fact may have so excited his disordered brain as to cause him to imagine the treasure. Looking back at the episode now, after the lapse of years, that, it appears to me, was very much my mental attitude with regard to it; yet, my doubts notwithstanding, I was determined to leave no stone unturned to test Barber's story to the uttermost; consequently when, late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the following day, we actually came upon the hulk, my chief feeling was one of surprise. There was nothing whatever of an exciting or dramatic character in the circumstances connected with our discovery; it was all absolutely commonplace; we were not even molested by natives, of whom we saw no sign from first to last. Having thoroughly searched, without result, the entire area of the flat country for a space of eight or nine square miles immediately opposite the...", "...hardly think they will,\" answered Harriet, smiling and nodding. \"I should feel sorry for them if they tried.\" \"They'd feel more sorry for themselves.\" \"It is nearly nine o'clock, dear. You had better get ready for bed,\" advised Harriet. \"All lights must be out at nine o'clock except on special occasions like to-morrow night when we shall undoubtedly get permission to sit up later.\" The next day was an active one in camp. There was a baseball game in the morning, a basketball game <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with tether ball and quoits on the side. Jane was admitted to all these. She was strong and active, but she lacked the skill of her friend Harriet. The latter's playing in basketball and tennis was a revelation to the guardians who had never known a high school girl who could play such an even and skilful game. It was a foregone conclusion that Harriet was in a fair way to earn more beads by her accomplishments in the games of the camp. Tommy with her usual bad luck...", "...with leaves in the island fashion. She also informed Lalia that her husband had gone away in a canoe to look for her body, with two natives, but that he had come across a case of gin, and was now dead drunk on the opposite side of Utwe. It is hardly to be expected that a young girl could feel love for a man of her husband's years; but tears of humiliation coursed down her cheeks when the woman added that he had already asked an Ocean Island girl to be wife to him. About four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> messengers arrived from Lele with a message of regret from the king to Captain Hayston, and an invitation for me to Chabral harbour, so that I could get better quickly; and he could send his own boat for me.

I slipped up, with my faithful old dog close in my rear, to within clever shooting-distance, and just as the buck stuck his nose in the drink I drew a bead upon his top-knot, and over he tumbled, and splurged and bounded a while, when I came up and relieved him by cutting his wizen--\" \"Well, but what has that to do with an _adventure_?\" said Riley....", "...Finding entreaty and resistance equally fruitless, I prepared to follow the messengers, and took leave of my landlord and his company with great reluctance.

On the road we saw a party of Moors, well armed, who told us that they were hunting for a runaway slave; but the townspeople informed us, that a party of Moors had attempted to steal some cattle from the town in the morning, but were repulsed; and on their describing the persons, we were satisfied that they were the same banditti that we had seen in the woods. Next morning (March loath) we set out for Samamingkoos. On the road we overtook a woman...", "...last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had numbered few familiars--even the master of the servant-maid had only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as common observers will.

From time to time we met numbers of newly organised cavalry,--with droves of horses led by halters; and of these steeds I was ready to lay any odds that some were Irish bred. Men and horses were on their way to the front to replace the maimed, killed, and wounded, and to contribute themselves to a similar contingent.

He was wondering at that minute how his tail looked, but he was determined not to turn his head. The old Woodpecker's eyes twinkled. \"I should think,\" he said, \"that since you are young and have no family to look after, you might preen your feathers in the morning and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and when you go to sleep. Then, of course, when it is stormy, you will have to take your waterproof out of the pocket under your tail, and put it on one feather at a time, as all birds do.

So that night in the early twilight, he paced off the length of the south side of the pond and found it was approximately seven hundred feet from the bridge to the forebay. He remembered that, except on rare occasions, the opening between the abutments of the bridge that carried the lane over the brook had always been sufficient to...", "...Irene went home, bearing more distinct ideas of resistance in her mind. In this great crisis of her life she felt that she needed just such a friend, who could give direction to her striving spirit, and clothe for her in thoughts the native impulses that she knew only as a love of freedom.

It was in this mood of mind that she met her husband when he returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> from his office. Happily for them, he was in a quiet, non-resistant state, and in a special good-humor with himself and the world. Professional matters had shaped themselves to his wishes, and left his mind at peace.

So the finding of the place, instead of helping to solve the problem of Nangotook's disappearance, only increased the boys' perplexity as well as their uneasiness.

Having searched everywhere for some trace of their companion, they were in a state of puzzlement over what to do next, but too restless to remain quiet. So they paddled to the entrance of the cove, and made their way out among the reefs, and along the base of the steep cliffs to the southwest. As they were going slowly along, with a line and hook attached to the stern paddle, Jean, who was in the bow, caught...", "...his way to Great George Street much oftener than his sister, Mrs. Arundel, wished, or Gilbert expected.

Gilbert found silence his safest course with his uncle, and tried to put a restraint on himself when in his presence.

He walked leisurely, because he was going to Jedburgh, but had not made up his mind if he would get there that night, since Pete had told him of a farm where he could stop. About four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he stopped near the middle of a barren moorland and looked round.

To the east, where the horizon was hazy, the high ground fell away, and he thought he could strike another road to Jedburgh in three or four miles if he crossed the heath. There...", "...whether it was due to this cause or not, but until the 26th it appeared as though the enemy's opposition in our front was weakening. On that day, however, a very marked renewal of activity commenced. A constant and vigorous artillery bombardment was maintained all day, and the Germans in front of the First Division were observed to be \"sapping\" up to our lines and trying to establish new trenches. Renewed counter-attacks were delivered and beaten off during the course of the day, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a well-timed attack by the First Division stopped the enemy's intrenching work. During the night of the 27th-28th the enemy again made the most determined attempts to capture the trenches of the First Division, but without the slightest success. Similar attacks were reported during these three days all along the line of the allied front, and it is certain that the enemy then made one last great effort to establish ascendency.

Anxiously intent, therefore, on the undertaking through the greater part of the 23rd, and on the whole of the 24th, I omitted no available opportunity of observing her...", "...Pope retreated across Bull Run with the remnant of his army and by morning was ensconced behind the field-works at Centreville. There was no mistaking the fact that General Pope had lost the battle and the campaign. He decided to lead his army back to the entrenchments of Washington.

There was a large army camped in the vicinity of Ringgold, and the hills and valleys were covered with camps, and rung merrily with the voices of many soldiers. It now became evident that the indomitable Sherman was assembling his whole force to make a crushing effort to drive back the threatening rebels under Jo. Johnston. The few days we remained at Ringgold our army was continually...", "...At that hour the Germans attacked our line from the Ypres-Poelcappelle road to within a short distance of the Menin highroad, it being evidently their intention while engaging us closely on the whole of this sector to break our front in the vicinity of the Ypres-Roulers Railway, to the north and to the south of which their strongest and most determined assaults were delivered. Under this pressure our front was penetrated at some points around Frezenberg, and at 4:30 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we made a counter-attack between the Zonnebeke road and the railway in order to recover the lost ground. Our offensive was conducted most gallantly, but was checked before long by the fire of machine guns.

EVERY POSSIBLE MEASURE THOUGHT OF Every possible measure of relief for the survivors that could be...", "...\"Where shall we look now for a leader?\" CHAPTER XIV The castle of Kuessnacht lay on the opposite side of the lake, a mighty mass of stone reared on a mightier crag rising sheer out of the waves, which boiled and foamed about its foot. Steep rocks of fantastic shape hemmed it in, and many were the vessels which perished on these, driven thither by the frequent storms that swept over the lake. Gessler and his men, Tell in their midst, bound and unarmed, embarked early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at Flueelen, which was the name of the harbour where the Governor's ship had been moored. Flueelen was about two miles from Kuessnacht. When they had arrived at the vessel they went on board, and Tell was placed at the bottom of the hold. It was pitch dark, and rats scampered over his body as he lay. The ropes were cast off, the sails filled, and the ship made her way across the lake, aided by a favouring breeze. A large number of the Swiss people had followed Tell...", "...had stepped out of the sheltered life, strong only in her untried honesty, to become a hunted, harried thing, juggling with honor and reputation, in her heart a half-formed fear that she might kill a man this night to gain her end? The elements were moulding her with irresistible hands. Roy's contact with the primitive had not roughened him more quickly than had hers. She met her appointment with Struve, and they rode away together, he talkative and elated, she silent and icy. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the cloud banks to the eastward assumed alarming proportions. They brought with them an early nightfall, and when they broke let forth a tempest which rivalled that of the previous night. During the first of it armed men came sifting into McNamara's office from the rear and were hidden throughout the building. Whenever he descried a peculiarly desperate ruffian the boss called him aside for private instruction and gave minute description of a wide-shouldered, erect,...", "...quivered as he looked at his mother. \"I told you!\" he said, running to the dresser for his cap. \"Take your pudding in your hand--and it's only five past one, so you were wrong--you haven't got your twopence,\" cried the mother in a breath. The boy came back, bitterly disappointed, for his twopence, then went off without a word. \"I want to go, I want to go,\" said Annie, beginning to cry. \"Well, and you shall go, whining, wizzening little stick!\" said the mother. And later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she trudged up the hill under the tall hedge with her child. The hay was gathered from the fields, and cattle were turned on to the eddish. It was warm, peaceful. Mrs. Morel did not like the wakes. There were two sets of horses, one going by steam, one pulled round by a pony; three organs were grinding, and there came odd cracks of pistol-shots, fearful screeching of the cocoanut man's rattle, shouts of the Aunt Sally man, screeches from the peep-show lady. The...", "...printed in sophomore red on big white placards, flamed from every available space in and about the campus the next morning. The nocturnal bill-posters had shown themselves no respecters of places, for the placards adorned not fences and walls alone, but were pasted on the granite steps of each recitation hall. All the forenoon groups of staid seniors, grinning juniors and sophomores, or vexed freshmen stood in front of the placards and read the inscriptions with varied emotions. But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a cheering mob of the \"infants\" marched through the college and town and tore down or effaced every poster they could find. But they didn't get as far from the campus as the athletic field, and so it was not until Neil and Paul and one or two other freshmen reported for practise at four o'clock that it was discovered that the high board fence surrounding the field was a mass of the objectionable signs from end to end. \"Oh, let them stay,\" said Neil. \"I think they're...", "...of Mrs. Orkeke's household for the dignified discomfort of my present quarters. They were also shared by Mena, whose good qualities had raised him above his fellow Chilians. Their number had been reduced to four, Arica having disappeared whilst hunting near Teckel: without doubt his quarrelsome disposition had occasioned his death at the hands of some one whom he had insulted or offended. The route followed led northwards through a valley on both sides of which we hunted, and arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at an encampment called Carge-kaik, or Four Hills. There was nothing remarkable in the scenery: the hill-sides on either hand were covered with scrub, and the summits presented masses of rocks, and in some places loose boulders, amongst which numerous armadillos were basking in the sun. They are easily captured, as they are very slow; but if they once get into their burrow it is difficult to extract them, owing to the tenacity with which they hold fast to the soil....", "...until he had mastered himself, then she said kindly: \"I don't wonder you feel as you do. You leave the matter to me, and I'll do my best to keep things in abeyance until we reach Hong-Kong. Once they are separated, the danger is practically over.\" It is doubtful, however, whether the combined efforts of the captain, Mrs. Weston, and even Percival himself could have kept things _in statu quo_ had a timely typhoon not arrived and taken things into its own hands. It was about four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that the sky darkened and the bright blue water turned to gray. The wind shifted and came on to blow dead ahead. \"What a queer light there is on everything!\" cried Mrs. Weston, who was dutifully stationed between Bobby and Percival, doing sentry duty. \"I wonder if it is going to blow up a storm.\" \"I hope so,\" said Bobby. \"I love for things to happen.\" Percival glanced despairingly at Mrs. Weston, who was beginning on a fresh ball of yarn. If she continued to sit...", "...and doing \"big things,\" that will live in history. But, as before remarked, the common soldier can only obey orders, and while some form the moving column, others necessarily have stationary duties. But at last the old 61st Illinois was on the wing,--and the Mississippi Central Railroad could \"go hang.\" The regiment at this time was part of Gen. Nathan Kimball's division of the 16th Corps, and the entire division left Tennessee to reinforce Grant at Vicksburg. We arrived at Memphis <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day we left Bolivar, the distance between the two places being only about 72 miles. The regiment bivouacked that night on a sandbar on the water front of Memphis, which said bar extended from the water's edge back to a high, steep sand-and-clay bank. And that, by the way, is the only night I have ever spent within the limits of the city of Memphis. While we were there on this occasion, I witnessed a pathetic incident, which is yet as fresh and vivid in my...", "...years of my life,\" Grey replied, and every word was a sob, for he was moved as he had never before been moved, even when he first heard that Bessie was dead. All thoughts of going on deck were given up for that day, and when the steward came to help him up the stairs, he helped him instead to his berth, where he lay with his eyes closed, though Lucy, who sat beside him, knew he was not asleep, for occasionally a tear gathered on his long lashes and dropped upon his cheek. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Lucy made her way again to the steerage quarters, for thoughts of the sick girl had haunted her continually, though she did not now believe her to be the Bessie whom Grey had loved and lost. But who was she, and who was the Neil of whom she had inadvertently spoken? and why was she so like the Bessie, Grey had described? \"Blue eyed, golden-haired, with a face like an angel,\" she repeated to herself, as she descended the stairs to the lower deck and walked to the...", "...and looked thoughtfully at his _vis-a-vis_. \"Stanhope's a queer fish,\" he said abstractedly; \"a queer fish.\" Then, rising, he added: \"I will send my report to-morrow.\" \"Very good.\" \"And I shall not follow Stanhope's example. Once I am fairly entered into the case, I shall send my reports regularly.\" \"I'm glad of that,\" said his Chief, rising and following him to the door. \"Under the circumstances, I'm glad of that.\" CHAPTER LII. THE VERDICT OF AN EXPERT. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day following that on which Carnegie the Expert had received his commission from the Chief of the detectives, he appeared again in the presence of that personage. He carried his \"documents\" in a small packet, which he laid upon the desk, and he turned upon the Chief a face as cheerful and as full of suppressed activity as usual. \"Well?\" queried the Chief, glancing down at the packet, \"have you done?\" \"Yes;\" beginning to open the packet with quick, nervous...", "...by the fire keeping the coffee hot and listening, when suddenly I heard a crackling of the bushes between me and the river and in a second or two Clem, laughing as over a joke, came to the fire with the water running off him in streams. While I was trying to get an explanation Steward also appeared in the same condition. At first they would not tell what had occurred but finally they confessed on condition that I would keep the matter a secret. They had made a long hard climb and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> had come to a place where Steward found it necessary to descend to the river in examining the strata. They intended to climb back, but when the work was done the sun had set and it was too late to venture up as they could not climb in the dark. Rather than stay there all night they made a raft of two little dead cedars and tying their shoes upon it, they waited for the moon to rise. This was very soon and they slipped into the current relying on the raft merely to keep...", "...Spottsylvania; Sedgwick was to his left and Burnside on our extreme left. Hancock was yet back at Todd's Tavern, but as soon as it was known that Early had left Hancock's front the latter was ordered up to Warren's right. He formed a line with three divisions on the hill overlooking the Po early in the afternoon, and was ordered to cross the Po and get on the enemy's flank. The fourth division of Hancock's corps, Mott commanding, was left at Todd's when the corps first came up; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> it was brought up and placed to the left of Sedgwick's--now Wright's--6th corps. In the morning General Sedgwick had been killed near the right of his intrenchments by rebel sharpshooters. His loss was a severe one to the Army of the Potomac and to the Nation. General H. G. Wright succeeded him in the command of his corps. Hancock was now, nine P.M. of the 9th of May, across the left flank of Lee's army, but separated from it, and also from the remainder of...", "...my eyes I yeard him smashin' through the trees. The puff and flame of the powder must ha' skeered him bad, but I didn't wait beyond a second to search for my gun, and I seed the stock one side of a tree and the barrel bent up a yard away. He had moved it away, and were waitin' for me to wake. Then I lit out for the water an' hid away. That was Saturday. On Sunday I took the back tracks, without a wepin or anythin', and blow me ef that bull didn't reg'lar hunt me.

I jes' managed to reach the first bough when, ker-blunk, he came up ag'inst it an' nearly shook me off. By gum! the way that bull went on was a caution. He let off steam through his nose, stamped his feet, dug his tusk in the ground, twisted his little tail, and butted that tree till its roots heaved up the ground. In his walk he wore down a circle as big as a cattle kraal, smashin' all the trees down, and trampling the...", "...see Gen. Wayne himself,\" Kingdom insisted. \"Even if I can do nothing else for John Jerome, perhaps I can obtain freedom for Fishing Bird, and he and I can do something.\" Still the party of petty officers, scouts, and soldiers with whom Kingdom talked shook their heads, and it was only after considerable urging that one of the men said he would try to arrange matters for Ree to see the commander. Kingdom had reached the encampment of Wayne's \"Legion\" at about mid-day. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when his new-found friend, a sergeant named Quayle, consented to see if Ree could not have a talk with Gen. Wayne himself. The delay seemed past all understanding to Kingdom, little acquainted with army customs and discipline. And when the sergeant returned, bringing a superior officer with him, who, after talking with the anxious lad, told him that the general would see him in the morning, Kingdom's patience was sorely tried indeed. He did, however, obtain an...", "...bays. This part was evidently old, but long brick wings were added of more modern construction. \"The county has bought it for a lunatic asylum, I hear from Jawkins,\" said the wit grimly. \"Where is the Duke of Richmond?\" asked Geoffrey. \"Still in Russia?\" \"Giving boxing lessons,\" said Dacre. The rest of the ride was made in silence. They went down through a valley naturally fertile. None of the large older houses seemed to be occupied, but were falling into waste. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they drew up at Chichester Cathedral, among the ruins of which they were to lunch. The grooms took the horses off to an inn in the little village near by, and Jawkins's man proceeded to unpack the hampers. For some reason, Miss Windsor avoided Geoffrey. The Duchess and Sir John sat silently beside one another; Ripon was left to Mrs. Carey. It was a pretty picnic; but the party did not seem to enjoy it very much. From the Chichester ruin the roof has quite...", "...had ordered, he saw that they were placed in exactly the right positions for effect. Being urged to stay for lunch, he stayed. And his conversation during the meal was so fluent, so aristocratic in flavor, and yet so friendly, that Serena became more and more taken with him. With the captain he was not quite as much at his ease. But he did his best to be agreeable, and Daniel, still vaguely suspicious, found nothing tangible upon which to base distrust. There was so much to be done <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that, acting upon a hint so delicate that it could scarcely be called a hint, Mrs. Dott urged him to send to the hotel for his bag and stay at their home overnight. He accepted and was even busier than he had been during the forenoon session. He was never so busy as to perform manual labor with his own hands--he never stooped to that extent--but he managed to convey the impression of being always ready and always helpful. To say that Mrs. Black and Mrs. Lake were,...", "...taken on September sixth; on the next day, September seventh, the citadel surrendered. Here, in lieu of the 42- centimeter, which was otherwise engaged for the moment, the attacking forces brought into play an Austrian battery of 30-centimeter guns. So far as I have been able to ascertain this was the only Austrian command which had any part in the western campaigns. The Austrian gunners shelled the fort until the German infantry had been massed in a forest to the northward. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the infantry charged across a succession of cleared fields and captured the outer slopes. With these in their possession it didn't take them very long to compel the surrender of Fort Boussois, especially as the defenders had already been terribly cut up by the artillery fire. The Austrians must have been first-rate marksmen. One of their shells fell squarely upon the rounded dome of a big armored turret which was sunk in the earth and chipped off the top of it as...", "...Redmond, \"for he is always a fund of entertainment in himself; I have thought of him many times this dull morning, and I hope that we shall find a letter from him awaiting us at Digby.\" If Amy agreed with her mother, she did not so express herself at this moment; yet if the truth were known, it must be said that more than once since their parting at Yarmouth she had regretted that she had not at least given Fritz a chance to join their party. When the carriages came to the door <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Amy recognized them as having formed part of the funeral procession; they were shabby, with hard seats, and the horses, as well as the vehicles, looked as if they had seen better days. It was arranged that Amy and Pierre should go in the small carriage, as Madame Bourque's husband assured them that the horse was perfectly safe for a lady to drive. \"Ah, he could not run away!\" \"I should think not,\" said Amy. \"If he manages to carry us even the three miles to Church...", "...from side to side. \"Ralph, my head bothers me--it aches so strangely.

A delirium had seized him, and kindly as he was tended by the nurses and his comrades, he never regained his senses. A few days of apparent suffering, and Bill Elliotts kindly heart ceased to beat. The uncouth, rugged, but brave soldier had passed on to the Great Beyond.

This, I was told, is the way they formerly were trained. As in a bull-fight, so here my sympathy was naturally with the animal, which managed to bite a dog severely in the side and shook another vigorously by the tail. Finally some young boys gave it a merciful death with spears. A woman blian died after an illness of five days, and the next forenoon a coffin was made from an old prahu. She had not been ill long, so the preparations for the funeral were brief. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> wailing was heard from the gallery, and a few minutes later the cort\u00e8ge emerged on its way to the river bank, taking a short cut over the slope between the trees, walking fast because they feared that if they lingered other people might become ill. There were only seven or eight members of the procession; most of whom acted as pall-bearers, and all were poor people. They deposited their burden on the bank, kneeling around it for a few minutes and crying mournfully.

The other members of the party had not done very much in the bad weather, one or two small excursions to spots in the neighbourhood excepted.

Our way lay round by Hrutafell by the side of the river Falakvisl, which runs in a deep gorge at the foot of the mountain. From this river we struck across rough lava, then moraine matter, and again lava right up to the river Svata. The rivers, as a rule, run along at the edges of the lava flows; there are some exceptions, however, and one instance,...", "...now, that the circumstances in which we were involved, justified the measure which I adopted.

For three days and nights, although the Fleet Surgeon tried everything to make him sleep, he did not stop shouting and knocking on the cabin bulkhead, and as his cabin was in the gun-room flat we couldn't get away from his shouting, and it got on our nerves most terribly, so much so that we were all beginning to feel jumpy ourselves.

Game here, too, made its appearance in greater plenty. Elk were frequently seen on the hills, and now and then an antelope bounded across our path, or a deer broke from the groves. The road <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> was over the upper prairies, several miles from the river, and we encamped at sunset on one of its small tributaries, where an abundance of prele (_equisetum_) afforded fine forage to our tired animals. We had traveled thirty-one miles. A heavy bank of black clouds in the west came on us in a storm between nine and ten, preceded by a violent wind. The rain fell in such torrents that it was difficult to breathe facing the wind; the thunder rolled incessantly, and the...", "...start from Cape Evans were completed, their heavy load when they set out on the following morning being distributed on two 9-foot sledges, 'This winter travel is a new and bold venture, but the right men have gone to attempt it.

On the morning of that day the wind blew furiously, but it moderated a little <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Atkinson and Gran, without Scott's knowledge, decided to start over the floe for the North and South Bay thermometers respectively. This happened at 5.30 P.M., and Gran had returned by 6.45, but not until later did Scott hear that he had only gone two or three hundred yards from the land, and that it had taken him nearly an hour to find his way back.

It stood open, and there was no sentry on duty. A few soldiers could be seen, loitering about in the street; but it was evident that, now the war was over and everything finally settled, it was considered that all occasion for vigilance was at an end. Upon making inquiries, they soon found a house where they could put up for the night. They had, as is the custom in India, brought their provisions with them, and after leaving their...", "...for me but to face these difficulties patiently, and relying on the faithful Friedrich Schmitt, but ignoring Minna, I began to take the necessary steps for making my post at Konigsberg secure. This, as well as the arduous part I took in the business of the theatre, kept me so busy and so much away from home, that I was not able to pay any particular attention to Minna's silence and reserve. On the morning of the 31st of May I took leave of Minna, expecting to be detained till late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> by rehearsals and business matters. With my entire approval she had for some time been accustomed to have her daughter Nathalie, who was supposed by every one to be her youngest sister, to stay with her. As I was about to wish them my usual quiet good-bye, the two women rushed after me to the door and embraced me passionately, Minna as well as her daughter bursting into tears. I was alarmed, and asked the meaning of this excitement, but could get no answer from them,...", "...to instruct me at home. Adelaide saw that it was in vain to argue the point any farther. But the foolish reasoning of Josephine made a great impression on Rosalind; so true it is, that \"evil communication corrupts good manners,\" and she was seized with an earnest desire to participate in the happiness of doing nothing. Next morning, Rosalind went to her lessons with great reluctance, and consequently did not perform them well. On the following day she was equally deficient; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Josephine went up stairs to take her nap, Rosalind, looking after her, exclaimed, \"Happy girl! How I envy her!\" \"Envy her!\" said Adelaide, \"of all the people I am acquainted with, I think Josephine Sherborough is the least to be envied.\" _Rosalind._ She is not troubled with lessons, and sewing, as we are.

Jack, leaning out, thought of other evenings, when those lights had shone in the beautiful Val d'Arno. He stopped there now for a few hours' rest, and the place seemed laden with memories which yet were younger than it was easy to believe. It was a warm night; even already the air was touched with sweet flowery scents, and all the carnival people were flashing about, making the place merry with their laughter. His journey began again early the next morning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he reached Rome. Who does not know that approach? As the train passed through the golden brown campagna the sun was setting; no words can describe the rich glow which tinged the mountains: too rich for lilac, too delicate and warm for purple, it seemed the very embodiment of colour, and where on the highest points the snow of winter yet rested, it was on fire with rosy lights; while Tiber, rolling sluggishly through the Sabine meadows, gave back the soft reflections...", "...his death in the great church which he had constructed at Aix-la-Chapelle.

Bessy was spending the evening at All Souls' Rectory: she and Mr. Hastings were active workers together in parish matters; and Cecil was dining at Ashlydyat. Mrs. Verrall had called <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and carried her off. Dessert was on the table, but Thomas had turned from it, and was sitting over the fire. Miss Godolphin sat opposite to him, nearer the table, her fingers busy with her knitting, on which fell the rays of the chandelier. They were discussing plans earnestly and gravely. \"No, Thomas, it would not do,\" she was saying. \"We must go. One of the partners always has resided here at the bank.

Here, too, was Henry Mellus, who came out with me before the mast in the Pilgrim, and left the brig to be agent's clerk on shore.

Then, perhaps--she told her poor, foolish, jealous little heart--then, perhaps, Sidney would love only herself. CHAPTER XVI. For a brief period <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the clouds of the morning promised to disperse. The wind shifted from the rain quarter, and the sun made a sickly attempt to shine. Patches of yellow light tantalized the sulky sides of the mountains. A presumptuous rainbow started to span the sky, but parted in the middle and soon disappeared in the settled gloom which quickly followed. When the sun first tried to break through the clouds, shortly after luncheon, Mrs. Sanderson proposed a walk. \"Come,\" she...", "...people were ordered to be ready on the morning of July 16, 1906, in the courtyard of the hotel (Illustration 16). The start should be delayed not a day longer; I had now waited long enough. It was evident that some hours would be required to get all in marching order for the first time. At eight o'clock the men from Poonch came with their mules, but only to tell me that they must have 5 rupees each for new clothes. The purchase of these articles of clothing took up four more hours, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the preparations had progressed so far that there was only the loading-up to see after. Some hours elapsed before the pack-saddles and loads had been adjusted. The mules were very excited, danced round in circles, and kicked so that the boxes flew about, and at last each animal had to be led by a man (Illustration 17). The hired horses were more sensible. Manuel on his steed presented rather a comical appearance: he had never mounted a horse in his life, and he looked...", "...Turkish transports lying at the wharves there. At Nagara there was a lighthouse that was an easy landmark to pick out, and not far distant white barracks and hospitals. Then, passing down towards the entrance, the huge citadel of the Straits, Kelid Bahr, blocked the view of the opposite shore and of the fortress Chanak, and yet lower down still, where the peninsula fell away, I could see across the narrow channel the white scarps of Dardanus and the town called Whitecliffs. These towns <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> looked like miniature cities on the side of a vivid, wonderful landscape; they were a mass of white domes and towers. The sun glinted on the windows of the houses, and a thousand scintillating lights darted like the fire of rifles from the dwellings. Blue, beyond, the hills round Troy stood back from the raging battle being fought on the point of the peninsula. An aeroplane swung out of the distance and flew up and down the Straits, its observer prying into the secrets...", "...us lay the trackless immeasurable desert, in awful silence. At length, after consultation, we determined to steer west and by north, by compass, the make of the land in that quarter indicating the existence of a river. We continued to march all day through a country untrodden before by an European foot. Save that a melancholy crow now and then flew croaking over head, or a kangaroo was seen to bound at a distance, the picture of solitude was complete and undisturbed. At four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we halted near a small pond of water, where we took up our residence for the night, lighted a fire, and prepared to cook our supper: that was, to broil over a couple of ramrods a few slices of salt pork, and a crow which we had shot. At daylight we renewed our peregrination; and in an hour after we found ourselves on the banks of a river, nearly as broad as the Thames at Putney, and apparently of great depth, the current running very slowly in a northerly direction....", "...you shall not make a fool of me: Had not De Segur fortunately for him--had the ingenuity to extricate us from the dilemma into which my confidence and dependence on you had brought me, I should have made a fine figure indeed on the first day of my emperorship.

Remembering the recent flattery of her courtiers, and comparing it with the unfeeling treatment of her husband, she found herself so much the more unfortunate, as the expressions of the former were regarded by her as praise due to her merit, while the unkindness of the latter was unavailingly resented as the undeserved oppression of a capricious despot. Business, or perhaps malice, made Napoleon forget to send her any dinner; and when, at...", "...affection are grateful after these fine people with whom I live at sword's points, though for the present turned downwards.

The psalms were the quickest thing in church music that Jan had ever heard; they went with such a swing that he found himself trying to sing for the first time in his life.

Then he found that he had lost the thread himself, that he could not pick it up again, that everything escaped him except a transfigured face and a voice both stern and tender. But these were flag and bugle to the soldier concealed...", "...here?\" \"He had applied for them.\" \"When did he disappear?\" \"I haven't seen him for two nights,\" she sobbed.

The young woman was plainly wild with anxiety. \"Oh, can't you help me find Nikola?\" she pleaded. \"I'll try my best,\" reassured Kennedy, taking down on a card her address and bowing her out. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before we had an opportunity to call at the Gaskell town house where the Rovignos were staying. The Count was not at home, but the Countess welcomed us and led us directly into a large library. \"I'd like to have you meet my father,\" she introduced. \"Father, this is Professor Kennedy, whom Alex and I have engaged to look into the burning of our house.\" Old Roger Gaskell received us, I thought, with a curious mixture of restraint and eagerness. \"I hope you'll...", "...in our escape, which was this, that my nag (or rather, Master Udal's), and my cloak were both gone a- hunting with the mayor. However, we could not both have ridden the one, or worn the other, and we might perchance run less risk without them than with them. As for the college cap and gown, my comrade nailed them with our keeper's two daggers on the outside of the door when we left, in token that here he bade farewell for ever to the life of a scholar. It was scarcely three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when we made good our escape. Before sundown, thanks to my comrade's knowledge of the country (which was all the more wonderful that he had been only two months at Oxford), we had fetched a wide circuit round the north of the city, and were safe on the Berkshire side of the river beyond Wightham, on the road to Abingdon. For four hours my comrade had paced at my side without a word, and I, finding nothing to say, had been silent too. When, however, all danger from...", "...scorched _cicale_ became silent, having, as the country people declared, returned to the earth whence they sprang. The heat had passed even _cicala_ pitch.

The _Constitution_ was sound and whole; the _Java_ had only her mainmast left and was full of yawning rents. _Old Ironsides_ had a new feather in her cap. Like the _Guerriere_, the _Java_ was hurt past help. It was impossible to take her home; so on the last day of 1812, the torch was put to her ragged timbers and the flames took hold. Quickly they made their way through the ruined ship. About three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they reached her magazine, and with a mighty roar the wreck of the British ship was torn into fragments. To the bottom went the hull. Only the broken masts and a few shattered timbers remained afloat. Such is war: a thing of ruin and desolation. Of that gallant ship, which two days before had been proudly afloat, only some smoke-stained fragments were left to tell that she had ever been on the seas, and death and wounds had come to many of her men.

Most of these twelve were arquebusiers; and besides the weight of the ridiculous little cannon, they had their ponderous flintlocks and their clumsy armor,--poor helps for scaling heights which the unencumbered athlete finds difficult.

On the following day I was to go back to Lady Ursula to receive my ruby ring. As I sat and worked by Hetty's side, I planned how I would take the little excursion in the morning, bring back the ring, and amuse my sister <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> by telling her the story of it.

Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Egremont took leave of his friends. Mr. Newthorpe went out into the rain, and at the last moment shook hands with him heartily. Annabel stood at the window and smiled farewell. The wheels splashed along the road; rain fell in torrents. Egremont presently looked back from the carriage window. The house was already out of view, and the summits of the circling hills were wreathed with cloud.

The object of this was to winnow out as much of the sand as possible. After picking out nearly all the pebbles, I placed about forty pounds' weight of the residue in the gunny bag and humped it down to the spring. Load after load I carried down. It was then too late to do any panning, so I stumbled down the mountain side in the gathering gloom. Next morning I recommenced my humping. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I panned out all I had carried down. I found nearly half a pennyweight of gold in the heel of the dish. This was a splendid prospect. It was evident that the ground was rich. On the following days I took a prospect from a different spot on the saddle, with a similar result. I should, perhaps, explain that the finding of \"rough\" gold in a new place is always an event of considerable significance. Fine gold, or, as it is called, \"color,\" does not count; it is to be found...", "...too carefully the rights of the peasants, for upon their conduct rests the reception which will be accorded to all others who follow in their footsteps. CHAPTER XI TA-LI FU On Friday, September 23, we were at Chou Chou and camped in a picturesque little temple on the outskirts of the town. As the last stage was only six hours we spent half the morning in taking moving pictures of the caravan and left for Ta-li at eleven-thirty after an early _tiffin_. About two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we reached Hsia-kuan, a large commercial town at the lower end of the lake. Its population largely consists of merchants and it is by all means the most important business place of interior Yuen-nan; Ta-li, eight miles away, is the residence and official city. At Hsia-kuan we called upon the salt commissioner, Mr. Lui, to whom Mr. Bode, the salt inspector at Yuen-nan Fu, had very kindly telegraphed money for my account, and after the usual tea and cigarettes we went...", "...from the pot? Well, every day I saw our mistress take a little golden beetle out of the black box and put it into the pot. One day she held it up before me, saying, 'Look, puss, there is the cause of all our happiness. Don't you wish it was yours?' Then she laughed and put it back into the box that stays in the cupboard.\" \"Is that true?\" questioned Blackfoot. \"Why didn't you say something about it before?\" \"You remember the day Mr. and Mrs. Chu were here, and how Mrs. Chu returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> after master and mistress had gone to the fair? I saw her, out of the tail of my eye, go to that very black box and take out the golden beetle. I thought it curious, but never dreamed she was a thief. Alas! I was wrong! She took the beetle, and if I am not mistaken, she and her husband are now enjoying the feasts that belong to us.\" \"Let's claw them,\" growled Blackfoot, gnashing his teeth. \"That would do no good,\" counselled the other, \"for they would be sure to...", "...men reminded me of the great land boom of Dakota in 1883, in which I took a part. There was something fine and free and primitive in it all. We cooked our supper on the boat's stove, furnishing our own food from the supplies we were taking in with us. The ride promised to be very fine. We made off down the narrow lake, which lies between two walls of high bleak mountains, but far in the distance more alluring ranges arose. There was no sign of mineral in the near-by peaks. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the wind became so high and the captain of our boat so timid, we were forced to lay by for the night and so swung around under a point, seeking shelter from the wind, which became each moment more furious. I made my bed down on the roof of the boat and went to sleep looking at the drifting clouds overhead. Once or twice during the night when I awoke I heard the howling blast sweeping by with increasing power. All the next day we loitered on Bennett Lake--the wind...", "...and I doubt my wife is to blame. About noon had news by Mr. Wood that Butler, our chief witness against Field, was sent by him to New England contrary to our desire, which made me mad almost; and so Sir J. Minnes, Sir W.

I wrote and sent an express to Walthamstow to Sir W. Pen, who is gone thither this morning, to tell him of it. However, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Wood sends us word that he has appointed another to go, who shall overtake the ship in the Downes.

In all respects an unwarlike scene, and one which would disappoint the searcher after sensation. Save for the lorries which bumped ceaselessly up and down the long straight road below, and the all-pervading khaki it might have been a scene at home before the war. The yellow fog had cleared away from Kemmel, and over the flat country the heat haze rose, shimmering and dancing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sun. In the field next to the camp an ancient Belgian was ploughing, his two big Walloon horses guided by a single cord, while from behind the farm there came the soft thud-thud of a football. And then it came. In a few seconds the air was filled with the thumping of Archie and the distant crackle of machine-guns. \"By Jove! there he is,\" cried the Tank. \"He's got him too.\" The officers halted and stared over the dead town of Poperinghe, where flash after...", "...666 saw the number of the hansom, booked it in his memory while he assisted in raising up an old gentleman who had been overturned, though not injured, in endeavouring to avoid it. During the lull--for there are lulls in the rush of London traffic, as in the storms of nature,--Giles transferred the number of that hansom to his note-book, thereby laying up a little treat for its driver in the shape of a little trial the next day terminating, probably, with a fine. Towards five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the strain of all this began to tell even on the powerful frame of Giles Scott, but no symptom did he show of fatigue, and so much reserve force did he possess that it is probable he would have exhibited as calm and unwearied a front if he had remained on duty for eighteen hours instead of eight. About that hour, also, there came an unusual glut to the traffic, in the form of a troop of the horse-guards. These magnificent creatures, resplendent in glittering steel,...", "...It has fallen somewhat into disrepute of late years with the rise of the comfort and efficiency standards. Nowhere else on the broad battlefields of Europe has it revived, to redeem the horror of war, so shiningly as in the New France. * * * * * Another aspect of French character which is both old and new is the quality of humorous \"sportsmanship\" the French have displayed. When Germany's crack aviator made a daily visit to Paris, dropping bombs, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> during the early weeks of the war, the Parisians took his arrival as a spectacle and thronged the boulevards to watch him and applaud. When at last he was shot through the head, the French press lamented his loss with genuine appreciation of his nerve and his skill. A young cavalry officer at the front told me this story: One of the younger officers of his regiment, to encourage his men, had offered rewards for German shoulder straps, that is, prisoners. Two simple...", "...ain't frivolous.\" \"Let's go to 'The Honeymoon'?\" suggested an amorous carl to his slip-slop Sal. \"Go 'long!\" she retorted with barn-yard bashfulness. \"Did you ever see 'The School for Scandal'?\" asked the smithy's good wife. \"Once,\" confessed the town official's faded consort, her worn face lighting dreamily. \"It was on our wedding trip to New York. Silas warn't so strict then.\" Amid chit-chat, so diverting, Saint-Prosper finished \"posting\" the town.

Pausing at a cross-road, he selected a tree for one of his remaining announcements.

As the traveler read the bill his expression became clouded, cheerless. Around him the fallen...", "...of sixty-three, and was buried near the Garden of Gethsemane. All that remains of the site of this small dwelling are some large stones, said to be the foundations. We then visited the Coelnaculum, or the room of the Last Supper. An ancient church, which is now converted into a mosque, is built on the site of the Last Supper room. It is a long hall with a groined roof, and some say that it is the actual site, built with other materials. We then visited the house of Caiaphas, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we sat in the English burial-ground on Mount Zion, talking and picking a flower here and there. Charles Tyrwhitt-Drake was our dear friend and travelling companion. He was a young man full of promise for a brilliant Eastern and scientific career.

When one of his domestics brought one of the brethren, and me, who had only just left him, this intelligence, I returned immediately with all speed, and found he had died in so very tranquil a manner, that without his feet and hands being in any respect discomposed, or his breathing increased, his senses, judgment and in some measure his voice, remaining entire to his very last gasp, he appeared more to resemble one in a state of sleep than death.... At two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> on Sunday, his body was carried to the common burying-place, called Plein Palais, without extraordinary pomp. His funeral, however, was attended by the members of the senate, the pastors, all the professors of the college, and a great portion of the citizens. The abundance of tears shed on this occasion afforded the strongest evidence of the sense which they entertained of their loss. According to his own directions, no hillock, no monument was erected to his...", "...the land.

I sent a boat out to discover the anchoring-place, which is called Cross-hill bay, while we kept running along the north-east and north side of the island, till we came to the north-west extremity of it, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> anchored in the bay we sought. The way to find this place at once, is to bring the largest and most conspicuous hill upon the island to bear S.E.; when the ship is in this position, the bay will be open, right in the middle, between two other hills, the westermost of which is called Cross-hill, and gives name to the bay.

I _could_ do it, theoretically, but in practice I knew I never would. I put the book down and went outside <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sunshine. The motel was run by a young married couple, and I watched the woman come out and put her baby in the playpen. She was laughing and talking to it; she looked happy; so did the baby. But _I_ wouldn't be. Not even if they let me. I couldn't live here and bring up a child--children?--on this primitive, almost barbaric, world. Never ever be able fully to communicate with anyone.

It was between three and four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day succeeding the night of my arrival in Paris, when I found myself standing at the door of the Hotel Mars, Champs Elysees. I had proved the Pension kept by Madame Denise to be everything that could be desired; and on my presentation of Raffaello Cellini's card of introduction, I had been welcomed by the maitresse de la maison with a cordial effusiveness that amounted almost to enthusiasm. \"Ce cher Cellini!\" the cheery and pleasant little woman had...", "...how venerable you looked in the moonlight, with your white hairs streaming!

He asked a coastguard man, whom he observed scanning the place with a glass, \"What it was?\" The man lowered his voice and said, \"Well, sir, it will be something coming ashore, by the way the folk are running.\" Mr. Fountain got a carriage, and, urging the driver to use speed, was hastily conveyed by the road to a part whence a few steps brought him down to the sea.

Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Griselda crept up to the ante-room, and sat down by the window. Outside it was nearly dark, and inside it was not much more cheerful--for the fire was nearly out, and no lamps were lighted; only the cuckoo clock went on tick-ticking briskly as usual. \"I hate winter,\" said Griselda, pressing her cold little face against the colder window-pane, \"I hate winter, and I hate lessons.

There were not enough visitors to go around; and more than one good housewife who had baked, boiled, and roasted all the day before was moved to righteous indignation at the sight of the good man of the house returning guestless from the meeting. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> entertainers and entertained gathered again at the meeting-house. Almost the entire country side was there,--old and young alike. The house was packed, for never before had that part of New England seen a man ordained to carry the gospel to the Indians. It occurred, too, in that dreary interval between the persecution of the Quakers and the persecution of the witches, and was therefore doubly welcome. When Cecil arrived, the throng made way reverently for him. Was he...", "...our barks. We also took possession of two new ships of about 400 tons burden each. Soon after this, the governor came on board one of the prizes, to treat for the ransom of the town and ships, but could not then agree, but promised to meet the captains again at seven in the evening, but did not keep his sword. This evening our boats took some canoes having silver on board. On the 24th in the morning, the governor came off again to treat, but no agreement could be made; and at four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we landed all our men in good order, when the Spaniards only fired one volley and then fled. Our men pursued them to where their cannon were placed, which they soon gained possession of, only one gunner, an Irishman, remaining by them till he was wounded in four places, of which he soon afterwards died. We marched through both towns in a compact body, driving the enemy before us, and then placed three guards in the three churches, setting fire to five or six houses...", "...the grass and feast their eyes upon the glories of the scene; but, feeling that we might all now with safety venture upon another light meal, Julius and I set off in search of what we might find, and soon returned with three fine coconuts. These I stripped of their outer husk with my knife; and a few minutes later we were all feasting upon the sweet, delicate fruit, after having shared the milk among us. Finally, through a careful and judicious system of feeding, by about four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we had contrived to allay our hunger and thirst and to recover enough strength to enable us to move about and accomplish short distances without undue fatigue. My next concern was to find some sort of refuge in which to pass the coming night. Of course, in the last resort it would be quite possible for us to return to the boat and sleep on board her as usual; but that idea had no charms for me. The under-deck quarters were very confined and altogether inadequate...", "...ship. He returned on board after nightfall, still more provoked and vexed. He had met with the greatest difficulty in his attempts to fill the places of his missing men. There were, as the reader has been told, very few whites on the island, and none of them were sailors. The blacks were very unwilling to engage, except upon exorbitant terms, and hardly one of those with whom he spoke appeared good for anything. He had at one time all but given up the matter in despair. But late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he was accosted by a dark-complexioned man, lean and sinewy as a bloodhound, who informed him that the vessel in which he traded between the South African ports and the West Indian Islands, had been driven on the Cape Verdes and totally wrecked. But the crew had escaped, he said, and were willing to engage with Captain Wilmore for the voyage to Calcutta. The captain hesitated. He had little doubt that the lost vessel had been a slaver, and he had an instinctive...", "...looking out in the murky light over the crumbling ruins of the old town, rose the battered wreck of the cathedral town and the spires of Cloth Hall. [Sidenote: German assaults on the east.] When Sunday dawned there came a short respite, and the firing for a time died down. The comparative lull enabled us to reorganize and consolidate our position on the new line we had taken up and to obtain some rest after the fatigue and strain of the night. It did not last long, however, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the climax of the battle was reached, for, under the cover of intense artillery fire, the Germans launched no less than five separate assaults against the east of the salient. To the north and northeast their attacks were not at first pressed so hard as on the south of the Menin road, where the fighting was especially fierce. In the latter direction masses of infantry were hurled on with absolute desperation and were beaten off with corresponding slaughter.

We can take only a short drive into the park, but you may see a few of the beautiful chateaus, which are the homes of the wealthy or aristocratic French people. You will not meet many equipages at this hour in the morning, but late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> there is a continuous stream of fine turnouts of all sorts. There are many, many places of interest in the Bois, but as we have all winter in which to visit them, we will content ourselves to-day with a brief visit.\" \"It begins to look,\" said Patty, \"as if even a whole winter would be all too short to see the beauties and glories of this wonderful Paris.\" \"Indeed, it would be too short to see everything of interest, but I can assure you, my child, that with an...", "...shanty and slept soundly, until about daybreak I was partly wakened by the feasters returning with discordant songs, though I promptly went to sleep again. I never heard exactly what happened in the wooden town that night, but there was wreckage in its streets the next morning, and when I opened my eyes the first thing I saw was our partner Johnston slumbering peacefully with his head among the fragments of his shattered banjo. CHAPTER XIX A GENEROUS OFFER It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the next day when Harry and I sat figuring in our shanty, while Johnston lay on a heap of cedar twigs sucking at his pipe and encouraging us languidly. \"I never could stand figures, and that's perhaps why I'm poor,\" he said. \"Go on, you are doing famously, and, though Ralph can't add up correctly to save his life, I'll take your word for it.\" He formed a characteristic picture of the free lance as he lay there, bronzed and blonde-bearded, with his massy limbs...", "...truly, for the violence of the gale decreased rapidly, and when at the end of an hour the pumps sucked, the crew gave a cheer, and tired out as they were, eagerly sprang aloft to repair damages and then spread more sail, Sarah and Susan de Boos hauling and pulling at the running gear from the deck below. They were both girls of splendid physique, and, in a way, sailors, and had Robertson allowed them to do so, would have gone aloft and handled the canvas with the men. By four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the little barque, with her wave-swept, bulwarkless decks, now drying under a bright sun, was running before a warm, good-hearted breeze, and the pumps were only attended to twice in every watch. Mrs. Lacy, Miss Weidermann, the De Boos girls, and the French priest were seated on the poop deck, on rugs and blankets spread out for them by Otway and the steward. Lacy, with Captain Burr, was pacing to and fro smoking his pipe, and laughing heartily at Sukie de Boos's...", "...tortuous mountain paths. Naturally, the nimblest, friskiest steers got in the front, and they were a sore trial to the Deacon, to restrain them to the line of march, and keep them from straying off and getting lost. Of course, a Deacon in the Baptist Church could not swear under any provocation, but the way he remarked on the conduct of some of the \"critters\" as \"dumbed,\" \"confounded,\" and \"tormented,\" had almost as vicious a ring as the profuse profanity of his fellow-herders. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the tired-out herd was halted in a creek bottom near Chattanooga. The patient animals lay down, and the weary, footsore Deacon, his clothes covered with burs, his hands and face seamed with bloody scratches, leaned on his frayed gad and looked around over the wilderness of tents, cabins, trains and interminable lines of breastworks and forts. \"Mr. Klegg,\" said the Herd-Boss, coming toward him, \"you've done your duty, and you've done it well. I don't know how I...", "...Laurence Thorndyke was lying in the best bedroom of Kent Farm, with Aunt Hester and Norine bending over him, and Uncle Joe scudding along on horseback for a doctor. All their efforts to bring him out of that fainting fit were vain. White and cold he lay; and so Norine Bourdon, with a great pity in her heart, looked first upon the face of Laurence Thorndyke. CHAPTER IV. THE LAWYER'S WARNING. Mr. Gilbert appeared in no hurry to revisit his friends at Kent Farm. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the next day before he came slowly along the quiet country road. He had passed the morning idly enough, staring from the hotel window, down at the peaceful street and the few straggling passers by. After his three o'clock dinner he had put on hat and overcoat, and leisurely taken his way over the familiar ground. It was a gray December afternoon, with a threatening of coming storm in the overcast sky. A few feathery flakes whirled already through the leaden air,...", "...others rode toward San Antonio. They slept that night in a pecan grove, and the next day continued their journey, meeting in the morning a Texan who informed them that Cos with a formidable force was in San Antonio. He also confirmed the information that the Texans were gathering from all points for the attack upon this, the greatest Mexican fortress in all Texas. Mr. Austin was commander-in-chief of the forces, but he wished to yield the place to Houston who would not take it. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they saw horsemen and rode toward them boldly. The group was sixty or eighty in number and they stopped for the smaller body to approach. Ned's keen eyes recognized them first, and he uttered a cry of joy. \"There's Mr. Bowie,\" he said, \"and there are Smith and Karnes, too! They are all on their way to San Antonio.\" He took off his hat and waved it joyously. Smith and Karnes did the same and Bowie smiled gravely as the boy rode up. \"Well, Ned,\" he said, \"we meet...", "...at the town, from the West and North. The position of the First Corps was then becoming perilous in the extreme, but it was improved a little before noon by the arrival upon the field of two Divisions of the Eleventh Corps (Gen Howard), these Divisions commanded respectively by Generals Schurz and Barlow, who by order posted their commands to the right of the First Corps, with their right retired, forming an angle with the line of the First Corps. Between three and four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the enemy, now in overwhelming force, resumed the battle, with spirit. The portion of the Eleventh Corps making but feeble opposition to the advancing enemy, soon began to fall back. Back in disorganized masses they fled into the town, hotly pursued, and in lanes, in barns, in yards and cellars, throwing away their arms, they sought to hide like rabbits, and were there captured, unresisting, by hundreds. The First Corps, deprived of this support, if support it...", "...called any other woman Mrs. Nash Caromel. Her uncle, Tinkle, of Inkberrow, called about the transfer of some of his funded property, and she was with him. I respect that young woman, Squire Todhetley.\" \"Ay, to be sure. So do I. Well, now, you will let me drive you back this afternoon, and you'll take dinner with me, and we'll go to Caromel's Farm afterwards. We never venture there before night; that Miss Gwinny Nave makes her appearance sometimes in the daytime.\" \"It must be late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> then,\" said the lawyer, rather crossly--for he did not enter into the business with a good grace yet. \"All the same to me,\" acquiesced the pater, pleased at having got his consent on any terms. And when the Squire drove in that evening just at the dinner-hour and brought Lawyer Crow with him, we wondered what was agate. Old Jacobson, who had called in, and been invited to stay by the mater, was as curious as anything over it, and asked the Squire aside, what he was...", "...it up in their later years without visible effect upon their health or mental strength. As to alcohol, I could not stand to drink brandy. Sometimes I drink a glass, but only as an exception. I find it much more convenient for me, and a good help to work, to take now and then a bottle of hock or champagne; but, as a rule, I drink half a bottle of claret at dinner, and a pint of beer at supper. I generally write in the morning from nine to half-past one, when I dine; and from five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to nine, when I take supper, but I could not bear to drink either wine or beer while at work.

During that time the men in the shed rarely speak to each other, but bend down to the labour in silence. After breakfast the tone improves a little, and continues to do so till dinner-time, when the tempers of the men will have become about normal; they are restored to their natural humour and disposition. When they return after dinner a still greater improvement is discernible, and by five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they are not like the same beings. In the evening, after tea, greater good-fellowship than ever prevails, and if a man meets his mate in the town he is quite cordial. By the next morning, however, he is metamorphosed again; the old conditions obtain, and so on day after day and month after month.

In the great rising under Paoli, the Corsicans would have achieved their independence, had not Genoa ceded the island to the crown of France. [176] Boswell, writing to Temple on May 14 of this year, says:--'I am really the _great man_ now. I have had David Hume in the forenoon, and Mr. Johnson <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day, visiting me. Sir J.

I spent the following day with Abde Pasha, who was an ardent sportsman, and entertained me with hawking. The Arab and Kurdish chiefs, who were in his camp, were summoned at dawn to accompany him. We formed altogether a very gay and goodly company. Bustards, hares, gazelles, francolins, and several wild animals abounded in the jungle and the plains, and before we returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> scarcely a horseman was without some trophy of the chase dangling from his saddle. The hawk most valued by Eastern sportsmen is the _Shaheen_, a variety of the northern peregrine falcon, and esteemed the most noble of the race. Although the smallest in size, it is celebrated for its courage and daring, and is constantly the theme of Persian verse. Those from the Gebel Shammar, in Nedjd, are the most prized, but being only brought by occasional pilgrims from Mecca,...", "...buildings and residences in Dayton, two miles each way from the center of the town, were hundreds of persons whom it was impossible to approach. Hundreds of fires which it was impossible to fight were burning. The rescue boats were unable to get farther from the shore than the throw line would permit. They could not live in the current. At midnight residents of Dayton watching the course of the flames from across the wide stretch of flood waters believed the fire got its new start <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in the store of the Patterson Tool and Supply Company, on Third Street, just east of Jefferson, whence it ate its way west, apparently aided by escaping gas and exploding chemicals in two wholesale drug establishments.

He had just passed his final examinations at the Gymnasium. He passed them splendidly, Herr Kreisphysikus. They even excused him from a part of his oral examinations. The whole city spoke of it; and when Herr Professor Lebeck came <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to buy cloth for a pair of trousers, he said to me: 'You may be proud of your son, Herr Eichelkatz; he does credit to you and to our Gymnasium. It's been a long time since we've had so gifted and industrious a pupil.' Lebeck's red nose glistened as though he had come directly from Heimann to me.

If the hairs of our head are all numbered, why not also the shoes of our feet?\" I therefore asked Him that we might recover this lost golosh.

Dr Brydon was covered with cuts and contusions, and was utterly exhausted.

The surgeon insisted upon an immediate interment near the scene of combat; but the gentleman who had officiated as second for the deceased expressed his determination to carry the unfortunate man's body back to his home and family, and the earliest train on the following day was appointed as the time for their departure. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Edna cautiously opened the door of the room which she had hitherto avoided, and with her apron full of lilies, while poppies and sprigs of rosemary, approached the coffin, and looked at the rigid sleeper.

She drew strength from Louis, and was borne into her room feeling, she said, very comfortable. I wanted to stay with her through the night, but she said: \"No, the baby needs you; so does Louis; I know how he feels; my night will be peaceful and my rest sweet; Aunt Hildy will rest beside me.\" \"Yes, yes, I'll stay, and we shall both rest well,\" said Aunt Hildy. In the morning she was weak, but we dressed her, and after eating a little she felt better, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> seemed very comfortable and happy. We had our supper at a little after five o'clock, and at six o'clock, as she had wished, all were in her room. \"Louis, roll my chair into the centre of the room, and let me face the west, for I love to see day's glory die.

The last was utterly impossible, as we had on board the whole miscellaneous collection made on our journey, with no such thing as a memorandum of the items. But by the active kindness of our late consul, Mr. Calhoun, and the courtesy of his excellency the governor, a special order was procured for transferring the whole without inspection from one vessel to the other. The next day was occupied in the details of this business, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we joined in a paseo, the style and show of which, for the moment, made us think slightingly of the simple exhibition at Merida; and after dark, by the light of a single candle, with heads uncovered, we stood before the marble slab enclosing the bones of Columbus. On the fourth we embarked on board the Ann Louisa. She was full of passengers, principally Spaniards escaping from the convulsions of Mexico, but Captain Clifford contrived to give us accommodations much...", "...to our leader that this would be a good place to make a stand, for if the Indians followed us we had the advantage in position. \"No,\" said he, \"we will proceed on to New Mexico.\" I was astonished at his answer, well knowing--though but slightly skilled in geography--that New Mexico must be many hundreds of miles farther south. However, I was not captain and we proceeded. Keeping the return track, we found ourselves, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the following day, about sixty miles from the scene of the murder. The assault had been made, as we afterward learned, by three young Indians, who were ambitious to distinguish themselves in the minds of their tribe by the massacre of an American party. We were still descending the banks of the Green River, which is the main branch of the Colorado, when, about the time mentioned above, I discovered...", "...we proceeded to skin the snake, which was no easy task under the fierce sun now baking our backs. Great flocks of _urubus_, or vultures, had smelled the carcass and were circling above our heads waiting for their share of the spoils. Each man had his section to work on, using a wooden club and his machete. The snake had been laid on its belly and it was split open, following the spinal column throughout its length, the ventral part being far too hard and unyielding. About two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we had the work finished and the carcass was thrown into the river, where it was instantly set upon by the vigilant _piranhas_ and alligators. Standing in front of this immense skin I could not withhold my elation. \"Men,\" I said, \"here am I on this the 29th day of July, 1910, standing before a snake-skin the size of which is wonderful.

Now California, of all places, is a region to tarry in. It is too huge, too complicated, too strange to be done in a flying visit, although a flying visit is well worth having. The clear atmosphere makes you imagine you could take an easy stroll over to the mountains, but a day would not suffice to reach them. You think you have exhausted some place or other, but you find that you have only skimmed over the surface. We left Los Angeles with regret <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of our third day there. We were sorry to leave our pretty garden anchorage, where we had for a near neighbor the distinguished Madam Melba, travelling on a concert tour in her private car. The diva had quite a suite in attendance. The only music that we heard from its sacred interior was from her colored _chef_, who, while his mistress was on the concert stage, made the garden, where we were wandering about in the moonlight, vocal with her piano and his by no means...", "...88\u00b0 29' on December 9.

We reckoned that we should be at the Pole on December 14. On the afternoon of that day we had brilliant weather -- a light wind from the south-east with a temperature of -10\u00b0 F. The sledges were going very well. The day passed without any occurrence worth mentioning, and at three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we halted, as according to our reckoning we had reached our goal. We all assembled about the Norwegian flag -- a handsome silken flag -- which we took and planted all together, and gave the immense plateau on which the Pole is situated the name of \"King Haakon VII.'s Plateau.\" It was a vast plain of the same character in every direction, mile after mile. During the afternoon we traversed the neighbourhood of the camp, and on the following day, as the weather was...", "...roasting and sputtering over a camp-fire! Yes, it was decreed that Jeanette should die! but when and where this terrible tragedy was to take place, was not yet determined upon. At their first halting-place, of course; but where was that to be? for, after having resolved upon the death of Jeanette, they travelled on for miles without arriving at any place where it would be possible to halt for the night! No water appeared, and without water they could not with safety encamp. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they had entered upon a strange tract, over which the road of the buffaloes led them. It was a part of the prairie--a series of low hills composed of pure gypsum. These extended around them, as far as our travellers could see, presenting on all sides a picture of alabaster whiteness. Neither plant, nor tree, nor any sign of vegetable life relieved the monotonous uniformity of the landscape. Turn to what side they might, their eyes were met by the lime-like surface...", "...and Lepine. Riel's emissaries had been at work for months, and as the time was now ripe for a rising he had called them together to decide upon some definite course of action. The weather was comparatively mild, and the Indians sat around on the snow that before many days was to disappear before the sudden spring thaw. Their red, white, and grey blankets against the dull-hued tepees [Footnote: Wigwams.] and the white wintry landscape, gave colour and relief to the scene. Two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and the sun shone brightly down as he always does in these latitudes. Riel knew exactly how long it would continue to shine, for had not the almanac told him and all the world--with the exception of the ignorant half-breeds and Indians whom he was addressing--that there was to be an eclipse that day. The arch rebel knew how strongly dramatic effect appealed to his audience, so he was prepared to indulge them to the full in this respect, and turn the matter to...", "...were some who would never walk, would never stand upright again, who had nothing before them but the grim life of a helpless cripple. There were others who could hardly hope to see the morrow's sun rise, and others again grey-faced with pain and with white-knuckled hands clenched to the stretcher-edges. But all, slightly wounded, or 'serious,' or 'dangerous,' seemed to have forgotten their own bitter lot, to have no thought but to bear back the good word that 'we're winning.' Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the weary doctors sensed a slackening in the flowing tide of casualties. They were still coming in, being attended to and passed out in a steady stream, but somehow there seemed less rush, less urgency, less haste on the part of the bearers to be back for a fresh load. And--ominous sign--there were many more of the bearers themselves coming back as casualties. The reason for these things took little finding. The fighting line was now well advanced, and every yard...", "...truth is sometimes depressing, and not the thing one wishes forever to have dinned into one's ears. \"And I know just as well as I know my own name, Margery, that now, after he's acted this way, he'll be coming back trying to make friends with you. You needn't tell me! I know him! But listen here, Margery, don't have a thing to do with him! Don't ever speak to him again, and pretend you don't even see him. He's not worth it--honestly he's not!\" When Margery parted from them later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Janet made her solemnly promise that henceforward she would consider Willie Jones as dirt beneath her feet. It was neither the time nor the place for Margery to ask herself whether she really wished to make such a promise, for, in the presence of so fiery an apostle of female rights, her private inclinations simply shriveled to fine ashes and blew away. \"Of course,\" murmured Margery meekly, \"of course I'll never speak to him again.\" \"That's right!\" Janet declared....", "...be relieved of them, and then deal with them just as they might think fit. When the mob was once outside the walls, they might be refused re-admittance, and put down with a strong hand. The Roman garrison, who, powerless to quell the tumult in the narrow and winding streets and multiplied alleys of the city, had been the authors of the manoeuvre, now took on themselves the stern completion of it, and determined to do so in the sternest way. Not a single head of all those who poured out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> should return at night. It was not to be supposed that the soldiers had any tenderness for the Christians, but they abominated and despised the rabble of the town. They were indignant at their rising, thought it a personal insult to themselves, and resolved they should never do so again. The gates were commonly in the custody of the city guard, but the Porta Septimiana, by which the mob passed out, was on this occasion claimed by the Romans. It was most suitably...", "...long enough to take off her gloves and tie the strings of her long white apron a little tighter about her trim waist; then she went to work again. \"No, I suppose I don't understand,\" Miss Deborah acknowledged; \"but never mind, we can talk here, only it is a little damp.

Friday is for cleaning up and putting things away, because Saturday one is always busy getting ready for Sunday.\" Miss Ruth demurred. \"I should rather have it on a Friday.\" \"Well, you don't know anything about the housekeeping part of it,\" said Miss Deborah, promptly. \"And I don't believe William Denner would want to come then; you know he is quite superstitious about Friday.

In the meantime groups of men dragged great stones laid upon a sort of hand sledge to the machine, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> it began to cast its missiles against the wall. Against these Walter could do little. He had no sacks, which, filled with earth, he might have lowered to cover the part of the walls assailed, and beyond annoying those working the machines by flights of arrows shot high in the air, so as to descend point downwards among them, he could do nothing. The wall crumbled rapidly beneath the blows of the great stones, and Walter saw that by the following morning a breach...", "...they are,\" said Margaret, in the same bantering tone. \"That sounds like good Mr. Lyon.

In the morning there was a drive with the ponies through town, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in the carriage by the sea, with a couple of receptions, the five o'clock tea, with its chatter, and in the evening a dinner party for Margaret. One day sufficed to launch her, and there-after Carmen had only admiration for the unflagging spirit which Margaret displayed. \"If you were only unmarried,\" she said, \"what larks we could have!\" Margaret looked grave at this, but only for a moment, for she well knew that she could not please her husband better than by enjoying...", "...thing in the world, that he should say a mass for her to _St. Secaire_; she was convinced that, this saint, unknown to martyrology, had the power of withering up (_secher_) and killing troublesome individuals, to accommodate those who invoked his aid.\"[27] [27] \"This woman,\" naively adds the writer, \"irritated at the refusal of the priest, showed that she could dispense with saintly help in the matter altogether: she killed her husband herself, with a gun.\" We take another walk <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> through the streets of the town, and afterward compare international notes once more with our cordial English clergyman.

An effectual disguise was imperative, and for this purpose I had purchased in another neighborhood a false beard which I had no difficulty in slipping on, unobserved, in a quiet street. Thus protected, with my overcoat drawn up to my ears, and my hat shading my eyes, I proceeded to the house in which she resided. I had to wait some time before she...", "...you can learn to sew and cook and take care of yourself, and not much harm done for her to fret about, but for _mercy's_ sake don't you go touching your hair.\" \"Well, it _is_ a bother,\" said Rosanna, \"but we will let it alone for awhile. Now you must come and wake me early, Minnie, and bring your sewing so you can sit here and tell me when I don't do the right thing.

It was said to be an English ship from Sunderland and, so far as could be ascertained, had seven men on board. In spite of strenuous efforts the pilots were unable to row around the mole, and the launching of a boat from the beach was out of the question, as the surf was too heavy. That sounded sad enough. But Johanna, who brought the news, had...", "...of cheerfulness under hardships. You will be placed in the order of the day with the thanks of your marshal for the spirit you have shown.

Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they were again engaged. The long columns ahead were delayed by crossing a narrow bridge over a river, and for two hours the rear-guard had to stand firm against constant attacks by the Russians. At one time a heavy column of Russian infantry moved down upon them, but Ney, riding up to the grenadiers, said: \"I give you the post of honour, comrades. Drive back that column.\" The colonel gave the order to charge, and the regiment rushed forward with such ardour to...", "...in the compound. The teacher who had hiked in from El Salvador, unconscious that his canvas leggings were transposed, was engaged in a deep game of solitaire.

After an hour or two of rest he would again be in the saddle for two days. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we started on constabulary ponies for Balingasag--a ride of thirty miles through quagmires, over swollen streams and mountain trails. Our ponies were the unaccepted present from a quack who thus had tried to buy his way out of the calaboose, where he was \"doing time\" for trying to pass himself off as a prophet.

So they swept on to their final goal, which was at Rose House and the cemetery beyond Pheasant Farm. These men had some terrible hours to face. By ill-luck their left flank was utterly exposed, and hostile aeroplanes, flying very low, saw this and flew back with the news. The enemy was already developing a series of counter-attacks by his \"Stosstruppen,\" or storm troops, of the 234th Division, which from three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> till seven o'clock that evening made repeated thrusts against the Highlanders' front, and the heaviest weight of two and a half battalions was sent forward against this flank. It was preceded by the heaviest German barrage ever seen by these Scots, who have had many experiences of barrage-fire.

These allies were fresh from a Parliament in Dublin, where the Statute of Kilkenny had been, according to custom, solemnly re-enacted as the only hope of the English interest, and they naturally drew the sword in maintenance of their palladium. Within six miles of Callan, in \"McMurrogh's country,\" they encountered that chieftain and his clansmen. In the early part of the day the Irish are stated to have had the advantage, but some Methian captains coming up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> turned the tide in favour of the English. According to the chronicles of the Pale, they won a second victory before nightfall at the town of Callan, over O'Carroll of Ely, who was marching to the aid of McMurrogh.

Next morning the cavalry moved out, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the whole force started, the cavalry thrown out ahead. A few shots were exchanged with parties of the enemy, but there was no serious fighting. The march was slow, for the ground was thickly covered with bushes, through which the troops with the ambulance and commissariat camels moved but slowly.

The bridge of boats at Bridgeport was frail, and, though used day and night, our passage was slow; and the road thence to Chattanooga was dreadfully cut up and encumbered with the wagons of the other troops stationed along the road. I reached General Hooker's headquarters during a rain, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 20th, and met General Grant's orders for the general attack on the next day. It was simply impossible for me to fulfill my part in time; only one division (General John E. Smith's) was in position. General Ewing was still at Trenton, and the other two were toiling along the terrible road from Shellmound to Chattanooga. No troops ever were or could be in better condition than mine, or who labored harder to fulfill their part. On a proper representation,...", "...around, out of range of the Black Fort and the works on the detached hills to the north-west of the city, to the Saltillo road. With this road in our possession, the enemy would be cut off from receiving further supplies, if not from all communication with the interior. General Worth, with his division somewhat reinforced, was given the task of gaining possession of the Saltillo road, and of carrying the detached works outside the city, in that quarter. He started on his march early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 20th. The divisions under Generals Butler and Twiggs were drawn up to threaten the east and north sides of the city and the works on those fronts, in support of the movement under General Worth. Worth's was regarded as the main attack on Monterey, and all other operations were in support of it. His march this day was uninterrupted; but the enemy was seen to reinforce heavily about the Bishop's Palace and the other outside fortifications on their left.

From Copiapo northward the longitudinal railroad to Iquique runs over a great arid desert winding its way across sandy plateaus hemmed in by barren mountains. The southern part of this desolation is named the Atacama Desert and here on the high mountainsides are seen the shafts and settlements of the gold and copper mines. Dulcinea is the first large mine reached. San Pedro is reached <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and later on Pueblo Hundido, the junction for Chanaral, and the headquarters of the Andes Copper Company. The next morning the train arrives at Catalina, the junction for Taltal and now enters the nitrate country. The same day it stops at Aguas Blancas, the junction for Antofagasta, Chuquicamata, the newly opened copper mining town of the Guggenheim interests, and Bolivia. The railroad from Catalina northward goes through the center of the nitrate country and has...", "...\"Rake's Progress.\" This series was published in 1735, and the church was then in a ruinous condition. It was subsequently pulled down and rebuilt (1741) in the form in which it now stands, with the exception of some slight alterations. In a curious diary in the Harleian MSS. collection it is stated that the Rev. Randolph Ford, curate of Marylebone between 1711 and 1724, on one Sunday \"married six couples, then read the whole of the prayers and preached; after that churched six women; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> read prayers and preached; christened thirty-two children, six at home, the rest at the font; buried thirteen corpses, read the distinct service over each of them separately--and all this done by nine o'clock at night.\" The only ancient charity connected with the church is a bread bequest left by Thomas Verley in 1692. He left L50, the interest to be spent in bread, twelve penny loaves to be given to the poor every Sunday. This ceremony is still observed, but the...", "...they were very glad to let off steam by killing a few hundred of them. But their hearts were not in the fight, in the sense of clear and profound conviction of the righteousness of the war. However, war is war, and they were soldiers, and \"orders is orders,\" as Tommy Atkins says. So let us turn to an honester, if grimmer, side of the picture. The first battle of the war began about 8:30 o'clock on the night of February 4th, and lasted all through that night and until about 5 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the next day. Our casualties numbered about 250 killed and wounded. The insurgent loss was estimated at 3000. \"Those of the insurgents will never be known,\" says General Otis. [196] \"We buried 700 of them.\" [197] There was fighting pretty much all around Manila, for the insurgents had the city almost hemmed in. An arc of a circle, broken in places possibly, but several miles long, drawn about the city, would probably suggest the general idea of the enemy's lines....", "...the absorbed and anxious house.

He wandered about, growing more and more unhappy, wondering if he had been made to fling himself into the face of fate for no reason, and sure that he could not meet his father without Phoebe's support. He could not even face her relations. It was very different from the day of triumph he had looked for; but, as Phoebe had wisely divined, this disappointment, and all the attending circumstances, did not do him any harm. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Northcote called. He too had acted on the information given by Betsy, and had gone to Cotsdean, who made him vaguely aware that Tozer had some share in the business in which Mr. May was involved, and who, on being asked whether it could be set right by money, grew radiant and declared that nothing could be easier. But when Northcote saw Tozer, there ensued a puzzling game at cross purposes, for Tozer had no notion that Mr. May had anything to do with the business,...", "...any different from other boys, as you will find.\" But in spite of these ominous words Andy made arrangements to leave Arden on Monday morning. He looked forward eagerly to his new life in New York. CHAPTER XIII. ANDY LEAVES HOME. Conrad was not slow in learning of Mr. Gale's departure from the hotel. The intelligence pleased him, for, as he supposed, it threw Andy out of employment. He sought an early opportunity of speaking to him on the subject. At five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the mail came in at the post office. Among those who congregated there at the time were Conrad and Andy. \"So you've lost your place?\" began Conrad, abruptly. \"What do you mean?\" asked Andy. \"Mr. Gale has left town, hasn't he?\" \"Yes.\" \"Where has he gone?\" \"To Pennsylvania, to stay with an uncle who is very sick.\" \"Do you think he will come back to Arden?\" \"I don't know, but I think it is doubtful.\" \"I suppose, then, you will go back to work on the...", "...smile since their troubles, she said.

She will be glad to see you, Mr Maxwell.\" \"She will be glad to see us all,\" said Clifton. CHAPTER SIX. A VISIT TO YTHAN BRAE. It was a great deal later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> than it ought to have been for the first visit of the minister, and the chances were he would have been told so in any other house in the parish. But Mrs Fleming welcomed him warmly, and all the more warmly, she intimated, that he came in such good company. The lateness of the hour made this difference in the order of events: they had their tea first, and their visit afterward; a very good arrangement, for their tramp through the fields and woods had made them...", "...of Broughton, sometime Secretary to Prince Charles Edward, 1740-1747_, p. 168.

Paddy at first was vexed, and showed it. \"Don't be an idiot,\" quoth Gwen. \"Why, it stands to reason it's pleasanter to have an escort for a long, cold, dark journey like that, and Lawrence is splendid to travel with. He just looks after you all the time and doesn't bother to talk. I shall come and fetch you in the brougham <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and go to Euston, and see you both off myself.\" She did so, and Paddy's good aunt was immensely impressed by the magnificence of the livery and horses of the equipage, that drew up in the dingy Shepherd's Bush street that December afternoon, outside the doctor's highly coloured front door. Gwen herself she only saw dimly through the drawing-room curtains, inside the brougham, but even that glimpse so impressed her that for several days the church guilds and things...", "...plots, or whatever you call them, and if some one of these gentlemen of elegant leisure--not one of whom so far has offered his services--cannot manage to escort you to your father's house, Ruth, I will take you myself.

As to Miss Felicia--she had already dismissed the young man from her mind. When it did arrive there was a slight flutter of interest, but...", "...After a state dinner at the Lieutenant-Governor's residence a Reception was held at the Parliament Buildings. The following day was a very quiet one. Her Royal Highness called on Mrs. Dunsmuir, wife of the Prime Minister, to express sympathy over a terrible disaster which had occurred at the Extension Mines and, after luncheon, the Duke and Duchess visited the Royal Jubilee Hospital. During the day the latter was presented by the miners of Atlin with a bracelet of gold nuggets. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> farewells were made and the voyage back to Vancouver commenced. From Vancouver they departed in the morning, the Duchess going to Banff where she stayed for a couple of days and the Duke going on to Poplar Point, Manitoba, forty miles from Winnipeg, where he enjoyed a couple of days' shooting with Senator Kirchhoffer. Winnipeg was reached on October 8th. They were cordially welcomed again and a visit was paid to Oglivie's Mill--said to be the largest in the Empire--and...", "...19th, the squadron had hewed its way by sundown to within eight hundred yards of Rolling Fork. They rested that night, and the morning of the 20th again started to work through the willows, but the lithe trees resisted all their efforts to push through, and had either to be pulled up one by one or cut off under water, both tedious processes. Meanwhile Ferguson, having collected 800 men and six pieces of artillery, attacked Murphy's little body of men, who had to be recalled. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Featherstone's brigade, with a section of artillery, arrived from Vicksburg to reinforce the enemy, and toward sundown opened a sharp fire upon the gunboats from a distance. Though this was easily silenced by the vessels, the difficulty of throwing out working parties in the presence of the enemy's force was apparent.

In the distance, Silver Brook was gleaming amidst the meadows. They sat down on one of the benches and watched the groups of players pass. Mr. Spence produced his cigarette case, and presented it to her playfully. \"A little quiet whiff,\" he suggested. \"There's not much chance over at the convent,\" and she gathered that it was thus he was pleased to designate Silverdale.

At eleven o'clock they spoiled their appetites for lunch with tea or bouillon to the music of a band of second-cabin stewards; at one, a single blast of the bugle called them to lunch, where they glutted themselves to the torpor from which they afterwards drowsed in their berths or chairs. They did the same things <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that they had done in the forenoon; and at four o'clock the deck-stewards came round with their cups and saucers, and their plates of sandwiches, again to the music of the band. There were two bugle-calls for dinner, and after dinner some went early to bed, and some sat up late and had grills and toast. At twelve the lights were put out in the saloons and the smoking-rooms. There were various smells which stored themselves up in the consciousness to remain lastingly...", "...of spiritual ecstasy, and the continuous, not to say unscrupulous, use they make of physical means to create spiritual abandon. They master the soul by manipulating the body.

This is inculcated with instructions which serve to make it detailed, intense, almost scientific. The pupil is ordered to examine himself twice a day, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and in the evening, and to make clear to himself every sin and failure that has marked his day's life. He is taught to enter them all, day by day, in a register, which will show him and his confessor his moral condition with arithmetical accuracy.

There the Turks, after a plucky night attack, came to grief on our wire entanglements. Another attempt to advance from the southeast was forced back by an advance of the Indian troops. The attack, during which it was necessary to advance on a narrow front over ground often marshy with recent inundations against our strong position, never had a chance. Indeed, the enemy was only engaged with our outpost line. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 3d there was sniping from the east bank between Tussum and Serapeum and a man was killed in the tops of a British battleship. Next morning the sniping was renewed, and the Indian troops, moving out to search the ground, found several hundred of the enemy in the hollow previously mentioned. During the fighting some of the enemy, either by accident or design, held up their hands, while others fired on the Punjabis, who were advancing to take the surrender, and...", "...where they would enter the river proper again. Nothing occurred to disturb their slumbers. They awoke before sun-up, and despite the chilliness of the atmosphere, took a plunge in the cool waters of the river. By seven-thirty they were on their way again, and paddling across the few intervening miles, they entered the Soulanges Canal. Here, of course, the water was smooth and still, and they moved along at a good rate, though the current somewhat retarded their progress. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they arrived at Coteau's Landing, where they decided to spend another night. This spot is one of the most interesting on the St. Lawrence. Stretching out before them was Lake St. Francis, over which, by utilizing Clark and Grand Islands, one of our large railway systems has erected a bridge, almost at the head of Coteau Rapids. It is a magnificent piece of railway construction, and brought forth many admiring comments from the boys. The next day's journey took them...", "...he would be a very good companion for Begum. \"What name shall we give him?\" said Swinton. \"Why, as my baboon is by title a princess, I think we can not create him less than a prince.

They had intended to have started earlier, but they found it impossible to collect the Hottentots, who were taking their farewells of their wives and their liquor-shops. As it was, most of them were in a state of intoxication, and it was considered advisable to get them out of the town as soon as possible. Late in the evening they arrived at Hermann's Kraal, a small military fort, where they remained for the night to give the...", "...must take our way through Tochty woods. Mrs. Pitillo took the minister into her hands, and compelled him to accompany her to Muirtown, where she had him at her will for some time, so that she equipped the kitchen (fully), a dining-room (fairly), a spare bedroom (amply), Mr. Saunderson's own bedroom (miserably), and secured a table and two chairs for the study. This success turned her head. Full of motherly forethought, and having a keen remembrance that probationers always retired <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at Mains to think over the evening's address, and left an impress of the human form on the bed when they came down to tea, Mrs. Pitillo suggested that a sofa would be an admirable addition to the study. As soon as this piece of furniture, of a size suitable for his six feet, was pointed out to the minister, he took fright, and became quite unmanageable. He would not have such an article in his study on any account, partly because it would only feed a tendency to...", "...The prickle of it against her skin was as pleasing to her as the rasp of his hair shirt to the saintly hermit.

No one looked like a detective. Loree felt secure, but not calm. Her feverish desire was to be alone with her twinkling treasure once more, and she wasted no time in getting back to her room. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she dressed hurriedly in a delightful frock of transparent blue muslin the colour of asphodels, and prepared for her drive with Quelch. When she glanced into the mirror just before leaving, she saw that, like Bathsheba, she was fair to look upon. But it was a new and glittering beauty that she had. Her cheek glowed; her eyes burned. Pat Temple would hardly have known his wife. Quelch's eyes told her even more than the mirror. As she came down the main stairway,...", "...again. At first he went to the hotel in Quebec where he had made his headquarters. There was no mail for him nor any word of Gale. He went down to the street and found the car and chauffeur he had hired until his shoulder should be well enough for him to drive himself. He directed the man to drive north. He had no specific destination, he proposed to merely drive through the northern roads again in the hopes of meeting someone or finding something that would lead to Gale. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they came to a small French village where they stopped for the luncheon they had missed. The chauffeur had much more of an appetite than Brent and while he waited for the man Brent decided to explore the little village.

It had been a very hot day. A visiting team of polo players from the western district of Victoria had battled hard <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> against the Adelaide team. The good game of polo in those days was in its infancy in Australia. A few enthusiasts in Adelaide and some in the wonderfully rich western district of Victoria, the De Littles, Manifolds, Blacks and others who owned thousands of acres of as good country as there is in Australia, kept the game going. An inter-colonial match was arranged.

Accordingly, he went to town after breakfast, armed with a letter from his wife to Mr. Brereton, Mrs. Crawford's lawyer. He came back early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> somewhat disappointed: it would take a day to complete the business. \"After all,\" he thought, \"I must not grumble about the delay. The direct transfer of the money will be better for me than the deed of gift.

At eleven in the evening of July 3 he whispered to Mr. Trist, the husband of one of his granddaughters, who sat by him: \"This is the fourth?\" Not bearing to disappoint him, Mr. Trist remained silent; and Mr. Jefferson feebly asked a second time: \"This is the fourth?\" Mr. Trist nodded assent. \"Ah!\" he breathed, and sank into a slumber from which he never awoke; but his end did not come till half past twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of Independence Day. On the same day, at Quincy, died John Adams, his last words being, \"Thomas Jefferson still lives!\" The double coincidence made a strong impression upon the imagination of the American people. \"When it became known,\" says Mr. Parton, \"that the author of the Declaration and its most powerful defender had both breathed their last on the Fourth of July, the fiftieth since they had set it apart from the roll of common days, it seemed as if Heaven had...", "...Hagerstown's well known business men is Mr. Walter E. Pattison, a former Pittsburgher. We sent him a grape-vine telegram of our advent in town and on coming down from breakfast in the morning he hailed us with a motorcar and an invitation for a drive through Greater Hagerstown. We accepted with alacrity, remembering the tedious hours of the previous day, and made no objection when the chauffeur cut up didoes with the Maryland speed limit. Mr. Pattison accompanied us to Williamsport <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to see \"Sometub\" and to join a little reunion with Col. George W. McCardell, the veteran editor of the Williamsport _Leader_. Editor McCardell had been looking for me for eleven years and we were somewhat in doubt as to the outcome of the interview.

The assault, made through heavy rain that transformed the battle field into a morass, was a complete success, the British winning back lost ground on a front of 300 yards, which Prince Rupprecht had captured in a dashing attack a few hours before. At every point in this sector the British succeeded in driving out the enemy and completely reestablished their former lines. In the morning and again <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of August 2, 1917, persistent and violent efforts were made by the Germans to win back lost territory to the east of Ypres. In spite of heavy losses they continued to attack at short intervals British positions from the Ypres-Roulers railway to St. Julien. Every assault was shattered by the British artillery barrage or the concentrated rifle fire of the British infantry. Although the constant falling rain made observation difficult the British aviators continued...", "...nerves. Henry hardly thought that she would rear him. He didn't rub that in, he was much too tender. He replied to her agonized questioning that, yes, it might be possible, with infinite precaution and incessant care.

It was with a pang, piercing her fatigue, that she gave him to the nurse to watch for the two hours <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when she slept. For she had bad nights with him because of the screaming. Brodrick had had bad nights, too. It had got on his nerves, and his digestion suffered.

With discreet intervals for refreshment, marching and music continued till 2 a.m., at which time sleep and a blessed silence fell on Jijona. Undeterred by but four hours' rest, punctually at six the cacophony of brass began again. By midday crusaders and bandsmen, having exchanged helmets and caps, were dancing jotas down the principal streets. But a short siesta revived them for the principal work of the day: the entry of the Moors. At about four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the performers gathered at the picturesque southern entrance of the village, thus symbolizing the direction from which the Moors had come. Then group by group, with blunderbusses banging off into the air, the Christians retreated slowly up the street, going backwards. Last of all the Christians went the Contrabandistas, and last of the Contrabandistas the Captain, dressed in a wonderful ancient costume of velvet, embroidered with gold, silver and silk, and a blanket...", "...we came into the valley, which is almost entirely covered with an Artemisioid odoriferous plant; no verdure was visible, even on the snowy ranges. We encamped close under a ridge about two and a half miles to the north of the summit of the pass. _21st_.--Halted: there being some water collected in attempts to form a nullah from the last rain, it is quite brownish and opaque, but deposits no sediment, and makes good tea, although disagreeable to drink in any other form. I walked out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> into a valley to the west, close to our encampment, and thence ascended a hill 600 feet high at least. This valley like the one in which we are encamped is covered entirely by an Artemisioid, a very fragrant plant, each shrub of which is distinct; mixed with it are tulips, several small Cruciferae, and a Fritillarioides. The same Artemisioid is also the chief plant on all the hills: it is mixed, but in small quantities with Cerasus pygmaeus, Equisetoid, Caragana,...", "...feathers! Here's wrathy contempt and the Pomps of the Flesh! How d'you call _them_?' 'Turkeys! Turkeys!' the children shouted, as the old gobbler raved and flamed against Hal's plum-coloured hose. 'Save Your Magnificence!' he said. 'I've drafted two good new things to-day.' And he doffed his cap to the bubbling bird. Then they walked through the grass to the knoll where Little Lindens stands. The old farm-house, weather-tiled to the ground, took almost the colour of a blood-ruby <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> light. The pigeons pecked at the mortar in the chimney-stacks; the bees that had lived under the tiles since it was built filled the hot August air with their booming; and the smell of the box-tree by the dairy-window mixed with the smell of earth after rain, bread after baking, and a tickle of wood-smoke. The farmer's wife came to the door, baby on arm, shaded her brows against the sun, stooped to pluck a sprig of rosemary, and turned down the orchard. The old...", "...TEA_ There is a fallacy among certain tea-fanciers that the origin of five-o'clock tea was due to hygienic demand. These students of the stomach contend that as a tonic and gentle stimulant, when not taken with meat, it is not to be equalled. With meat or any but light food it is considered harmful. Taken between luncheon and dinner it drives away fatigue and acts as a tonic. This is good if true, but it is only a theory, after all. Our theory is that five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> is the ladies' leisure hour, and that the taking of tea at that time is an escape from _ennui_. _TEA IN LADIES' NOVELS_ What would women novelists do without tea in their books? The novelists of the rougher sex write of \"over the coffee and cigars\"; or, \"around the gay and festive board\"; or, \"over a bottle of old port\"; or, \"another bottle of dry and sparkling champagne was cracked\"; or, \"and the succulent welsh rarebits were washed down with royal mugs of...", "...or rather the peak we climbed, a sugar-loaf of a mountain with almost perpendicular slopes near its top, crowned by a cluster of enormous boulders. From its crest one can see all over that part of the State. Half-way up we stopped at a small tavern, inquired the way to the top, borrowed two small blankets of the landlord, and bought some cold meat and bread and a few teaspoonfuls of tea. These we put in a haversack, and leaving my heavy painting-trap we continued on about three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to climb the peak. The only things we carried, outside of the provisions and blankets, were my pocket sketch-book and the Flobert pistol. It was the worst I have ever done in all my mountain climbing. Sometimes we edged along a precipice and sometimes we pulled ourselves up a cliff almost perpendicular. There was no doubt about the path--that was plainly marked by sign-boards and blazed trees and the wear of many feet, and then again it was perfectly plain that it was...", "...people whom I asked him to see.\" \"Oh!

When Dr. Arnold met her late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day, at little Johnnie's side, his surprise and chagrin found vent, first in a series of oaths, then, scowling at her like some thunder-cloud with the electricity expended, he said-- \"Do you consider me a stark idiot, or a shallow quack?\" \"Neither, sir, I assure you.\" \"Then, if I know anything about my business, I wrote you the truth this morning, and you treat my advice with cool contempt.

Mr. Kirke passed between those islets, and followed an opening to the S.E., for upwards of eight leagues. On his return, he reported that he had found a fine channel, of which the principal entrance was the opening of Sarmiento's 'Canal San Andres.' \"On the 12th, in full anticipation of making some interesting discovery, we sailed into the 'Canal San Andres,' anchoring <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in Expectation Bay, where we remained until the 15th. During that time, Mr. Kirke was employed examining the different openings, and tracing this supposed channel farther. At his return, he said that he had found a termination to every opening, even to that in which we then were, which he had previously thought to be a channel. Like the rest, it extended only to the base of the snowy Cordillera, and then was suddenly closed by immense glaciers. \"This information...", "...any intention of allowing Judith to make the trip under such circumstances, but he knew that for the present he could only bide his time.

Lost Chief was very proud of Judith's invitation and deeply interested in her preparations for the contest. Every day, now, she put Sioux and Whoop-la through their paces. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when she was working the animals in the corral, it seldom happened that one of Lost Chief's riders was not perched on the buck fence, watching her and criticizing her and always assuring her, with the cowman's pessimism toward the outer world, that she had no chance of winning a prize. Douglas watched the preparations with deep interest, but said nothing further against the trip. He usually joined the audience on the buck fence and smoked as he watched the really...", "...on the other things; I think I shall make an excellent cook of you one of these days.' \"'You can make anything of me, because you are such a darling teacher.' \"'I couldn't make a flatterer of you: nature has taken the job off my hands.' \"'I wish nature had furnished me with some strong language so I could tell my Lottie how dearly I love her.' \"'Look at you now! you are dropping the water in that bowl!' \"'Oh, I ask pardon--I didn't see it.' \"We delayed dinner until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in order to afford Harry and Viola an opportunity to come to an understanding; and we had reason to believe that what we so much desired had taken place. Lottie and I brought the dinner in, and when it was ready she managed to seat Viola and Harry on the same side of the table, and she and I sat at the other. \"'Now, Viola,' said Lottie, 'I have made you some of your favorite soup; I know you will like it, and I am sure it will do you good, and shall be glad if you...", "...the skirmishers and lines of battle were in about the same position they had taken up the evening before. Soon after daybreak it became evident that the conflict was to be renewed, and a little later the enemy resumed the offensive by an attack along my left front, especially on Walker's brigade. His attempt was ineffectual, however, and so easily repulsed as to demonstrate that the desperate character of his assaults the day before had nearly exhausted his strength. About 3 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he made another feeble charge on my front, but our fire from the barricades and rifle-pits soon demoralized his advancing lines, which fell back in some confusion, thus enabling us to pick up about a hundred prisoners.

The ball was opened by \"A\" Company, which <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of that day sent the usual daily patrol into Burjaliye, covering it with Lewis guns and flank patrols and suffering no casualties, but getting the recognised rise out of the Turks, whose enthusiastic rifle-fire gave life to the proceedings. On withdrawing from the enclosure, however, the company, instead of returning to camp, halted as soon as they were out of sight of the Turks, and lay up in a convenient hollow till dusk. The true cunning of this daily manoeuvre was...", "...at the rate of one mark to one franc, twenty-five centimes.

While we were going across one of the broad stretches of lawn, an officer on horseback passed us, accompanied by a mounted orderly. To our surprise the orderly drew his revolver and began waving it at us, shouting at the same time that if that ------------ dog came any nearer, he would shoot him down. The officer paid no attention, but rode on ahead. I started after them on foot, but they began to trot and left me in the...", "...and that's why it's so dark. It may be up over the top of the tree, and we may have been asleep here for a week, for all we know.\" Then they all gathered around to look at the snow, and went to the window and got some more, and tried to tell whether it was day or night, and Mr. Crow and Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum ran up-stairs to their rooms, and called back that it was day, for the snow hadn't come quite up to the tops of their windows. And it was day, sure enough, and quite late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at that, but they couldn't tell just what day it was, or whether they had slept one night, or two nights, or even longer. Well, of course the first thing was to get something to eat and a big fire going, and even Mr. 'Possum scrambled around and helped carry wood, so he could get warm quicker. They still had a good deal to eat in the Hollow Tree, and they were not much worried. Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon remembered another time they were snowed in, when Mr. Crow had...", "...are names of their god.

The greatest demonstration of all occurs on the last of the ten days. At sunrise the crowds of former days gather around the mosques to start again on the marches. On this day there are also fresh recruits. In front of the mosque is a band of 50 to 100 men and boys of 13 to 40 years of age. They are bareheaded, and uniformed with a white shirt over the other clothing that reaches to the feet.

She had never seen him before in her life and could not understand why her movements should interest him. \"The riddle is too involved for me,\" she told herself. \"I guess one mystery at a time is enough to worry about.\" It was still fairly early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and Penny did not wish to waste the day. She decided to make a bold move and call upon Mrs. Dillon. Yet she dreaded the interview. Taking a bus, she soon arrived at the society woman's home. When she rang the doorbell, the maid who answered, recognized her immediately. Her glance was not friendly. \"Is Mrs. Dillon in?\" Penny inquired. \"Yes, but I'm not sure she'll see you,\" the maid answered shortly. \"When I told her you were here the other day to see the...", "...life, brought up without the love of father, mother, sister or brother, in a home where noise and cheerfulness were outlawed.

We rode rapidly during the day, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> emerged from the _yucca_ forest at the foot of an _outlier_ of the Sierra before us, and came among the fields of flowers we had seen in the morning, which consisted principally of the rich orange-colored California poppy, mingled with other flowers of brighter tints.

He slept till morning, and when he awoke, immediately asked for something to eat. He would not even look at the bear's grease; but they cooked twenty eggs for him. He ate them voraciously, also a big loaf of bread, and drank about four quarts of beer; then he demanded that they call Zych, because he felt jovial. Zbyszko sent one of the Turks, given to him by Zawisza, after Zych who mounted a horse and came <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the young people were ready to go to the Odstajny lake to catch a beaver. At first there was plenty of laughter and singing, while they drank mead; but afterward the old _wlodykas_ began to talk about the children, each praising his own. \"What a man Zbyszko is!\" said Macko; \"there is no other like him in the world. He is brave and as agile as a wild-cat.

They made a fast march of twenty-three miles, and at two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sighted Bryant's. The firing had ceased. Captain Caldwell had laid another trap. Every Indian had sunk into forest or weeds or brush, to wait for the expected reinforcements. The garrison saw nothing at which to shoot, and half believed, themselves, that the siege was done. With a cheer the horsemen galloped up the dusty road, and into the lane between the trees and the cornfield. The men on foot took a short cut through the corn itself, to flank the cavalry...", "...It was the public boast of the disbanded militia that they would only go a short distance from the town and then after the Governor left for Nauvoo they would return and kill the prophet. When this fact was stated to the Governor by Dan Jones, one of the Elders of the Church, who heard the boasts, Governor Ford replied, that Jones was over anxious for the safety of his friends. The events of that day proved that the boasts of the prophet's enemies were not idle.

The arduous undertaking had been made easy, and a mighty army in the space of half-a-day laid in the dust. It seemed incredible. Babar remaining behind while he despatched parties of pursuit, rode, somewhat sad-eyed, over the battle-field. Here had been a fine stand! Five or six thousand dead bodies piled one upon another. Well! those had been brave men, dying for some cause, some point of honour. It was not until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that the cause, the point of honour, was made apparent. Ibrahim, their King's dead body was found in their midst. One Tahir found it, cut off the head, and brought it into the Headquarters' tent. \"Slave! Why didst do that? He was at least King to those poor souls. Take it back,\" said Babar sternly, then went on with his work.

I urged them to spread the story among their friends and get as many of them as possible to threaten to withdraw their trade. I started this campaign about three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and kept it up till after business hours. It bore fruit. Some of the women, I found out afterwards, went further than I had suggested and called on the wives of the firm.

Three more assaults followed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and evening. In the last of these some Germans got into the village, but they were at last driven out.

About four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Cornwallis formed the line of battle and began the attack: for some time the Americans sustained it with intrepidity, but at length gave way.

The Director had given his consent and had expressed his pleasure, so the Hancocks and the Mortons and Dorothy set out in high spirits. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they returned laden with their spoils. Early goldenrod and asters filled their arms, feathery green boughs waved over their heads, and long vines of clematis trailed behind them. The Ethels were not such good walkers as the others.

It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day on which the Scraggs had made their appearance. With a presentiment of trouble, Mrs. Darlington went down to the parlor. \"Madam,\" said Mr. Ring, as soon as she entered, speaking in a firm voice, \"I find that my wife has been grossly insulted by a fellow whose family you have taken into your house.

Tartarin hated all these people. Their gaity redoubled his misery. At last, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the third day, there was some unusual activity on board the ship, which roused our hero from his torpor. The bell in the bows rang out... the heavy boots of the sailors could be heard running on the deck... \"Engine ahead!... engine astern!.\" Shouted the hoarse voice of Captain Barbassou. Then \"Stop engine!\" The engine stopped, there was a little tremor and then nothing. The ferry lay rocking gently from side to side, like a balloon in the air. This strange silence...", "...The parliament, in the meantime, took care to strengthen Sir George Ayscue's fleet, so that it increased to thirty-eight sail; of which only two were large ships, and the rest frigates and fire-ships. With these he put to sea in search of the Dutch, took many rich prizes, and at last met with De Ruyter, who, with a fleet equal to his own, was convoying home between fifty and sixty merchantmen. This was on August 16th, 1652, and as our admiral was cruising off Plymouth. It was about one <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the fleets came in sight. De Ruyter took twenty of the merchant ships into his line of battle, and was then very ready to engage. The fight began about four, when the English admiral, with nine others, charged through the Dutch fleet, and having thus gained the weather-gauge, attacked them again, and continued fighting till night parted them; the rest of Sir George's fleet having very little to do in the action. The rear admiral, Peck, lost his leg, and soon...", "...in my boat, on February 26, from Gondokoro for Khartoum. Our hearts were much too full to say more than a short \"God bless you!\" They had won their victory; my work lay all before me. _II.--Perils of Darkest Africa_ My plan was to follow a party of traders known by the name of \"Turks,\" and led by an Arab named Ibrahim, which was going to the Latooka country to trade for ivory and slaves, trusting to Providence, good fortune, and the virtue of presents. That party set out early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of March 26, 1863. I had secured some rather unwilling men as drivers and porters, and was accompanied by two trusty followers, Richarn and a boy Saat, both of whom had been brought up in the Austrian mission in Khartoum. We had neither guide nor interpreter; but when the moon rose, knowing that the route lay on the east side of the mountain of Belignan, I led the way on my horse Filfil, Mrs. Baker riding by my side on my old Abyssinian hunter, Tetel, and the British...", "...small, fled at the approach of man. The experience of some of my friends in their acquaintance with American alligators has been of a more serious nature. It is well to exercise care about camping at night close to the water infested with large saurians, as one of these strong fellows could easily seize a sleeping man by the leg and draw him into the river. They do not seem to fear a recumbent or bowed figure, but, like most wild animals, flee before the _upright_ form of man. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I passed an island, made by a \"cut-off\" through a bend of the river, and, according to previous directions, counted fourteen bends or reaches in the river which was to guide me to Stewart's Ferry, the owner of which lived back in the woods, his cabin not being discernible from the river. Near this spot, which is occasionally visited by lumbermen and piny-woods settlers, I drew my canoe on to a sandy beach one rod in length.

We will have the wedding tour five years hence, when we come to celebrate our wooden wedding. Then you will be rich, perhaps.\" The grand ceremony which legalized and ratified all these arrangements took place at five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in the little church of St. Joseph. The city being yet small enough to feel a decided interest in the private affairs of any noted citizen, a crowd of uninvited spectators collected to witness the marriage of the popular young captain with the widow of the lamented Union General.

On one occasion the point of a \"cow catcher\" entered his neck and he was pushed by the engine a considerable distance. Even this did not terminate his charmed life, but several ugly scars remained as mementos of the adventure. Like others, he was taken prisoner by Brown and confined in the armory yard. About 3 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of Monday when the alarm had spread a long way and people had crowded in from the surrounding country, armed with every species of weapon they could lay hands on, John managed to escape by climbing the armory wall. When he was seen getting over, the country people to whom he was unknown supposed that he was one of Brown's men, and score of them blazed away at him with their guns. A shower of bullets whistled 'round him and his clothes, never in the best of repair, were...", "...experiences in healing, but always in an incidental way. [Illustration: JOHN ALEXANDER DOWIE] Charles G. Finney (1792-1875) had at least one experience as a healer. During revival services at Antwerp, N. Y., in 1824, two insane women were cured, but Finney was directly concerned in the restoration of only one of them. Of this he gives an account in his memoirs. \"There were two very striking cases of instantaneous recovery from insanity during this revival. As I went into meeting <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of one Sabbath, I saw several ladies sitting in a pew, with a woman dressed in black who seemed to be in great distress of mind; and they were partly holding her, and preventing her from going out. As I came in, one of the ladies came to me and told me she was an insane woman.... I said a few words to her; but she replied that she must go; that she could not hear any praying, or preaching, or singing; that hell was her portion, and she could not endure anything that...", "...Tincture _Blatta orientalis_ IX, one drop doses, six times daily, was given.

Mr. G., aged forty, healthy constitution, had an asthmatic fit on the 4th of August, 1890, preceded by a violent attack of cold, from which he frequently used to suffer. He had this severe cold in the morning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he began to experience a great difficulty of breathing and slight oppression and lightness of the chest--this, by 9 P.M., developed into a regular fit of asthma. I was sent for. On my arrival, at 10 P.M., I found he was sitting before a pile of pillows with elbows supported on them, and struggling for breath. There was also a great tightness in the chest, occasional cough, and inability to speak. I at once put him under _Blatta orientalis_ IX trit., one grain every...", "...way along those luscious topaz and amethyst clusters had been disturbing, but my conscience had held firm and I had passed them by. Sometimes I said: \"There are tons of those grapes; a few bunches would never be missed.\" But Narcissa and the others said it would be stealing; besides, there were houses in plain view. But there is a limit to all things. In a level, sheltered place below Bagnols we passed a vineyard shut in by trees, with no house in sight. And what a vineyard! Ripening <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sun, clustered such gold and purple bunches as were once warmed by the light of Eden. I looked casually in different directions and slowed down. Not a sign of life anywhere. I brought the car to a stop. I said, \"This thing has gone far enough.\" Conscience dozed. The protests of the others fell on heedless ears. I firmly crossed the irrigating ditch which runs along all those French roads, stepped among the laden vines, picked one of those lucent, yellow bunches and...", "...what could have brought this social and half-domesticated bird so far into these wilds. In La Grande Brulure, a hermit thrush perched upon a dry tree in a swampy place and sang most divinely. We paused to listen to his clear, silvery strain poured out without stint upon that unlistening solitude. I was half persuaded I had heard him before on first entering the woods. We nooned again at No Man's Inn on the banks of a trout lake, and fared well and had no reckoning to pay. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we saw a lonely pedestrian laboring up a hill far ahead of us. When he heard us coming he leaned his back against the bank, and was lighting his pipe as we passed. He was an old man, an Irishman, and looked tired. He had come from the farther end of the road, fifty miles distant, and had thirty yet before him to reach town. He looked the dismay he evidently felt when, in answer to his inquiry, we told him it was yet ten miles to the first house, La Chance's. But there...", "...as summary punishment was called. Fifty good, sharp strokes across the bare back with strong beechen sticks made Farmer Mervale wish he had been less fond of joking and illegally imprisoning a girl. Martha told how she had seen the monk, and had called to him through the open window, telling him how she had been served, and also asking him to let the Mountain Boys know of her detention. How well the eccentric monk had fulfilled his mission we have seen. It was rather late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the strong fort at Crown Point was reached.

I shall be under the necessity of taking the...", "...farther we came to a fine large water-hole, surrounded by Polygonums and young water-grass, and, at two miles farther, to another, and in about the same distance to a third. Recent camps of the natives were on each of them, and a beaten path led from one to the other. One of these holes was crossed by a weir made of sticks for catching fish. Bones of large fish, turtle shells, and heaps of muscles, were strewed round the fire places. The whole day was bright and very hot; the wind <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> from E.S.E. The latitude of our last camp was 21 degrees 31 minutes 16 seconds, being about eighteen miles W.N.W. from the lake. Mr. Roper and Brown rode about seven miles down the river, and found that it again formed a large regular bed well supplied with water; and that the country was of a more open character. They came suddenly upon two women cooking mussels, who ran off, leaving their dinners to their unwelcome visitors, who quickly dispatched the agreeable...", "...home of a friend of theirs, whose father was very rich. Toyo whispered, \"Oh, Lotus Blossom, I believe he's bringing us an invitation to Chrysanthemum's party. You know she is going to have one on her birthday.\" Sure enough, the man came up to the children, and, making a low bow, presented them with two daintily folded papers and then departed. They hastened to open them, and found, with delight, that they were really and truly asked to their friend's party. It was to be at three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the following Thursday. Lotus Blossom ran to her mother, just as her American cousins might do, and cried, \"Oh, mamma, my precious, honourable mother, what shall I wear? See this; do look at my invitation.\" It was a rare thing indeed to see the child so excited. Her mother smiled, and answered, \"My dear little pearl of a Lotus Blossom, I have almost finished embroidering your new silk garment. It shall be finished, and you shall have a new yellow crape kerchief to...", "...of your Little Southern Blossoms, CORA STRONG. DEAR PANSY: I have been very much interested in reading the little letters from different children, and I thought I would write too. May I tell you something about myself? I have had spinal disease for years, and am obliged to lie in bed all the time. I am in a hospital where are many children; those who are able to be up, go to school in the mornings, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the teacher comes up stairs to give little lessons to those who are in bed. The children have books, toys, games, and hobby horses. The girls like to play \"hospital,\" with their dollies, and have two or three boys for doctors. The dolls are treated as though they really felt sick; and the young doctors pretend to give them ether, before they perform their surgical operations! It is quite funny to see how the very little boys and girls will imitate doctors and...", "...sort of sewing. At another little sewing-table, immediately opposite to her, was a red-cheeked damsel with a frightful mop of light hair and a figure which had all the possibilities of stoutness before it. She was a sort of governess, and was supposed to be English, though they had only her word for it. She was reading a book. On the silk ottoman behind lay the already-mentioned Clementina, who ought to have confessed to the sin of yawning. She was a spinster already far advanced <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of life, and had cinder-coloured ringlets around her temples and a little bit of beard on her chin. She was no blood relation of the family but, as an ancient companion to a former mistress of the house, had long eaten the bread of charity under that roof. She was now engaged upon some eye-tormenting, fine fancy work which could not have afforded the poor creature very much amusement. The old gentleman on the sofa used to divert himself the whole day by assembling...", "...to get back to the cottage,\" wailed Nancy. \"Ye couldn't git there ter-day, fer this is Sunday, and we don't hev but two trains that stop here Sundays.

It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Mrs. Ferris called Nancy to listen to what she had to say. \"I kin talk ter ye now,\" she said, \"an' first I'll ask ye ef ye remember the old house in Merrivale where ye used ter live before Mis' Dainty give ye a home?\" \"I guess I _do_,\" said Nancy. \"Wal, 'twa'n't much of er livin' ye had, an' the woman what took keer of ye was only yer _stepmother_.

These most excellent people were the first, as they were the warmest, friends I ever made in the island; and when, late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the eighth day of our visit, Courtenay and I, with Pompey again for our pilot, mounted to return to Kingston, we received a very warm and evidently sincere invitation from the whole family to make their house our home whenever opportunity would afford. We slept at our hotel that night, and, bright and early next morning, made our way to Port Royal, where almost the first object which met our view was our new ship, the _Foam_, at anchor close under the stern of the...", "...went out on the lawn. Nothing was asked, and nothing told, that day. In truth there appeared to be no need. For it seems as though Love were not always invisible, nor the twang of his bow so faint as to elude the ear. With joyous blood his glad wounds are red, and who will may tell the sufferers. Sympathy too lends insight; your fellow-sufferer knows your plight first. There were fellow-sufferers on the lawn that day--to whom, as to all good lovers, here's Godspeed.

Everyone eat heartily of it; and it was so well liked that no part was wasted. Friday 14.

The sea by this time was quite calm, thus greatly facilitating our labour; but, from our not having had any food for two days, all hands were very weak, and it took them a much longer time to free the ship of all her rope hamper and cordage than they would have achieved the task in if they had possessed their proper strength. It was, therefore, quite late on <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the rigging on the port side was all detached, although Jake had recovered the axe at noon, and we had set to work immediately afterwards. This, however, was only a preliminary to the real labour that lay before us--that of cutting away the masts, a much more serious matter. The ship, it must be recollected, was lying completely over on her starboard side, with all her spars extended horizontally flat along the surface of the sea, which washed up to the...", "...been the Turkish VIIIth Army Headquarters, and the 4th Australian Light Horse Brigade was in touch with the corps cavalry of XXIst Corps at Beit Hanun, while the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade had taken prisoners and two of the troublesome Austrian 5.9 howitzers.

The 60th were in the centre, sandwiched between the Anzacs and Australian Mounted Division, and their allotted task was to clear the country between Sheria and Huj, a distance of ten miles. The country was a series of billowy downs with valleys seldom more than 1000 yards wide, and every yard of the way was opposed by infantry and artillery. Considering the opposition the progress was good. The...", "...gave no sign of displeasure, but inwardly he resented it. Of course these folks had heard of what had happened up at the prison, and no doubt among themselves would be commenting upon the tragedy and gossiping about it. Well, any man was liable to make a slip once; nobody was perfect. It would never happen again; he was sure of that much. All day he mooned about, a brooding, uneasy figure, speaking to scarcely any one at all, but followed wherever he went by curious eyes. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before it occurred to him that he had eaten nothing all day, and that he had failed to deposit the money he had earned that morning. It would be too late now to get into the bank; the bank, which opened early, closed at three o'clock. To-morrow would do as well. Although he had no zest for food despite his fast, he figured maybe it was the long abstinence which was filling his head with such flighty notions, so he entered a small, smelly lunch-room near the railroad...", "...at the head of the valley wonderfully clear and clothed with a fresh mantle of white. Instead of crossing over the river by the bridge, at Choebu, we kept straight on down the valley till we came to Choedzong, where were the first barley fields and cultivation.

We had to change our transport in this village and get fresh animals, so that it was not till three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that we got started again. In Tibet they have a system of stages, and animals from one village are taken, as a rule, for one stage only. As each stage usually ends at the next village, and as villages are frequent, this is a most awkward and inconvenient arrangement--as it necessitates three or four changes a day. In order to avoid these constant changes, we used to persuade the villagers by promises of extra baksheesh, especially where we had a large number of...", "...hair cut!\" Looking at him cursorily one thought that his hair was coarse and bristly, but it was very fine and when he put his hand through it, it remained standing in all directions which often looked comical.

It was to Mrs. Nevill Tyson's eternal credit that she made no claims. Clearly, when a tie can be broken to-morrow, there is no urgent necessity for breaking it to-day. So <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Stanistreet called again at Ridgmount Gardens. Whether or no Mrs. Nevill Tyson ignored the possibility of passion, she had the largest ideas of the scope and significance of friendship. She made no claims, but she exacted from Louis a multitude of small services for which he was held to be sufficiently repaid in smiles. Whether she knew it or not, she had grown dependent on him. She had always shown an affecting confidence in the integrity of masculine judgment, and...", "...experiences awaiting them. CHAPTER XX TILTING FOR THE SILVER SPURS Their journey led the young horsemen across the plains, over low-lying ranges, across broad, barren table-lands and down through the bottom lands until the wide sweep of the Rio Grande River at last lay before them. After the weeks of arid landscape the sight of water, and so much of it, brought a loud cheer from the Pony Rider Boys. The next thing was to find a fording place. This they did late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day, and their further journey took them to the little desert town of Puraje. They camped on the outskirts of the village. \"Here's where we get a real bath. Who's going in swimming with me?\" asked Tad. \"I am,\" shouted all the boys at once. The Professor and Kris Kringle concluded that they, too, would take a dip, and a merry hour was spent in a protected cove of the big river, where the boys proved themselves as much at home as they were in the...", "...Now Mrs Garlick well knew what Maria had to do. \"I'm going to change the curtains, mum.\" \"Well, you needn't,\" said Mrs Garlick. \"It's made such a difference up here, there being so much less smoke, that upon my word the curtains will do another three months quite well!\" \"Well, mum, I never did!\" observed Maria, meaning that so shocking a proposal was unprecedented in her experience. Yet she was thirty-five. \"Quite well!\" said Mrs Garlick, gaily. Maria said no more. But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Mrs Garlick, hearing sounds in the drawing-room, went into the drawing-room and discovered Maria balanced on a pair of steps and unhooking lace curtains. \"Maria,\" said she, \"what are you doing?\" Maria answered as busy workers usually do answer unnecessary questions from idlers. \"I should ha' thought you could see, mum,\" she said tartly, insolently, inexcusably. One curtain was already down. \"Put that curtain back,\" Mrs Garlick commanded. \"I shall put no...", "...supplies for our brigade, one company from each regiment being detailed for that purpose. They left Siboney early the next morning and reached us just as we were preparing to resume the march again. Our next camping place was on a plateau near where had once been a sizeable plantation and which was only a short distance from Las Guasimas. Here we remained two days taking life easy before we again took up the march. On the 27th we reached Sevilla and there remained until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of June 30th. During our stay in Sevilla occurred another food shortage and also the great tobacco famine. Rations were hard to get and so were medicines. There was so much feeling over the delinquency in getting our supplies up to us that a meeting of the company commanders was held and a committee appointed to wait upon Col. Clark to see if something could not be done. The outcome of all the talk was the loan of some of the horses of the field and staff to a detail...", "...dare say 'tis a wild, foolish, dangerous thing; but I do it, nevertheless! As for my reasons, they are the strongest. First, I wish to do it. Second, you've all opposed my doing it. So there's an end of the matter!\" It was, of course, a woman that spoke,--moreover, a young one. And she added: \"Drat the wind! Can't we ride faster? 'Twill be dark before we reach the manor-house. Get along, Cato!\" She was one of three on horseback, who went northward on the Albany post-road late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of a gray, chill, blowy day in November, in the war-scourged year 1778. Beside the girl rode a young gentleman, wrapped in a dark cloak. The third horse, which plodded a short distance in the rear, carried a small negro youth and two large portmanteaus. The three riders made a group that was, as far as could be seen from their view-point, alone on the highway. There were reasons why such a group, on that road at that time, was an unusual sight,--reasons familiar to...", "...and white as the blossoms of spring, and a mass of shining, golden hair.

Robert did not make his appearance next morning, and his absence seemed to give fresh ground for the expectation that Lady Darcy would drive over with him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and pay a call at the vicarage. Mrs Asplin gathered what branches of russet leaves still remained in the garden and placed them in bowls in the drawing-room, with a few precious chrysanthemums peeping out here and there; laid out her very best tea-cloth and d'oyleys, and sent the girls upstairs to change their well-worn school dresses for something fresher and smarter. \"And you, Peggy dear--you will put on your pretty red, of course!\" she said, standing still, with...", "...of humanity which we instinctively call by the high name of soul; and, whether he storms into the souls of others or glides into them, his hot invectives equally with his soft persuasions mark him as a man; a man, too, of might; a man whose force is blended with his insight, and who can win or woo his way into hostile or recipient minds by innate strength or delicacy of nature.\" In 1885 the poet's birthday was again quietly celebrated at Oak Knoll, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Mr. Whittier's portrait was unveiled before a large audience in the Town Hall of Haverhill. In September, 1885, occurred a most interesting festival--the reunion of the graduates of the old Haverhill Academy, for whom the poet cherished to the end of his life an earnest and outspoken affection. It was here that Whittier got all the scholastic education he ever had outside of the district school; the reunion was thoroughly enjoyed therefore by him, although it was in...", "...should never be undertaken by a small party. The best and safest course is to send for some Arab or Bedouin chiefs, either at Jerusalem or Bethlehem, and to make a contract with them for protection. In consideration of a certain tribute, these chiefs accompany you in person, with some of their tribe, to your place of destination and back again. The Counts paid the two chiefs three hundred piastres, with the travelling expenses for themselves and their twelve men. At three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 7th of June our cavalcade started. The caravan consisted of the four counts, Mr. Bartlett, a certain Baron Wrede, two doctors, and myself, besides five or six servants, and the two chiefs with the body-guard of twelve Arabs. All were strongly armed with guns, pistols, swords, and lances, and we really looked as though we sallied forth with the intention of having a sharp skirmish. Our way lay through the Via Dolorosa, and through St. Stephen's Gate, past the...", "...the people assembled for meeting at the usual hour of worship, and among them came also the mobbers; viz.: Simonds Ryder, a Campbellite preacher and leader of the mob; one McClentic, who had his hands in my hair; one Streeter, son of a Campbellite minister; and Felatiah Allen, Esq., who gave the mob a barrel of whiskey to raise their spirits. Besides these named, there were many others in the mob.

She asked him what he wanted of it; and...", "...units, and the longed-for luxuries of food and drink and news. All through the morning detachments of every size and every conceivable composition kept filing past--some with officers, most with none--some hobbling and silent, others whistling and in step--but all with one accord most thoroughly persuaded (such are the fallacies of a retreat) that they were the last and only survivors of their respective commands. Many, after a brief halt, had marched all night, and up to one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they were still coming in. A brief rest, some bread and coffee, and they were off once more, their troubles almost forgotten in the pleasure of rejoining their regiments and recovering their friends. The general Retreat, which the battle of Le Cateau had so dangerously interrupted, resumed once more its normal tenor. Of the behaviour of the men during this trying period it is difficult to speak with moderation. They had passed through an ordeal, both physical and...", "...of the Big Dipper are straight overhead, and point downward at the Pole Star, and if we could see them twelve hours later, or at nine in the morning, we should find them opposite, below the Pole Star, and pointing up at it. On June 1, they would arrive overhead two hours earlier, or at seven in the evening, and by nine o'clock would be west of overhead, while at seven and nine in the morning they would be opposite, or halfway around. On August 1 their halfway places would be at three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and three in the morning. So, figuring each month, and knowing where the \"Pointers\" are at nine, or at midnight, or at three in the morning, the Scout can read, for several nights running without appreciable change, what time it is. And on the plains the old trappers were accustomed to look up out of their buffalo-robes and say, \"By the Pointers it is midnight.\" The Big Dipper swings on such a wide circle that sometimes it drops into the hills or into mist. The...", "...several songs, and had found him a humane and righteous man. Within half an hour I was in his house and explaining my invention to his wife, he being absent. I aroused her interest so much that she seemed thoroughly eager to have me hurry back with a little press model, in order to show them both the working of the process. The entire behavior of the woman was so open and artless that I dismissed my first thought, \"I might be cheated out of my invention,\" and hurried to Herr Gleissner <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with my simple apparatus. My printing succeeded absolutely. Gleissner marveled at the swiftness and beauty of the impressions, and, knowing my penniless condition, he offered of his own free will to pay for a small printery. My mother had given me a press already. It was the ordinary copper-plate press with two cylinders. True, it was very roughly made, being a house carpenter's work, but it had cost only six gulden. However, one could make very pretty impressions...", "...However if you fail I will study it up and see what it will do.

THE KILLSBURY WOMEN ARREST THEMSELVES. On the fifteenth of July Schwarmer came as he was expected to do; for besides being a blunt man, he was known to be one who rarely broke his promise. He arrived on the morning train and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> while he was sitting in his beautiful office with the Golden Rule President on one side of him and Lawyer Rattlinger on the other, the door opened suddenly and disclosed a very pretty sight--namely a procession of ladies tastefully hatted and gowned. The ribbons which were fastened daintily on their shoulders fluttered like wings in the strong breeze caused by the opening of the door. He had been informed that a delegation of ladies would do themselves the honor of...", "...for women to dare to go so far that some of the best of its members will leave a well-regulated church.

If they come the rest will.\" * * * * * Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Mrs. Graves put on her bonnet, and, with a sigh, tied the strings under her withered chin. In the very moment when the congregation had at last become reconciled to the privileges extended to its female members, another church war was to be fought. But the little woman dared not refuse her husband's command, so she climbed the long hill toward the south and timidly rang the bell marked \"Hall.\" Her husband would have been there and gone, for the afternoon was well...", "...felt it in his bones that if any accident did happen it would be in that quarter.

Indeed, they had hard work making him break away, when Jack tooted his conch shell as the signal for a start. Matomkin Inlet proved as easy as the others. \"Now for the terror!\" remarked George, as later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they approached the spot where Watchapreague lay. Ahead they could see the whitecaps marking the fierce cross currents that have given this half-mile wide inlet its bad name. Many a wreck of shore boats has taken place here, and lives been lost. \"We might as well get over now, as in the morning, for the tide is as good as it will ever be.

It was looking very beautiful, very inviting, on the arrival of our travellers late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of a warm, bright October day. The woods and the trees that bordered the avenue were in the height of their autumn glory, the gardens gay with many flowers of the most varied and brilliant hues, and the lengthening shadows slept on a still green and velvety lawn.

In its turn the mining company belonged to the officials of the railroad. The manager of the mine had a brother who was division superintendent. It was the mine manager who had stood by the door of the mine when Cracked McGregor went to his death. He lived in a city some thirty miles away, and went there in the evening on the train. With him went the clerks and even the stenographers from the offices of the mine. After five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> no white collars were to be seen upon the streets of Coal Creek. In the town men lived like brutes. Dumb with toil they drank greedily in the saloon on Main Street and went home to beat their wives. Among them a constant low muttering went on. They felt the injustice of their lot but could not voice it logically and when they thought of the men who owned the mine they swore dumbly, using vile oaths even in their thoughts. Occasionally a strike broke out and Barney...", "...did not reply. She was up again by this time, and busying herself as usual with the preparations of Evelyn's evening attire, and before her sister left her, a promise had been extracted that the girl would not sit up till Evelyn's reappearance that night. The next day passed without event of any moment. It seemed long and wearisome to Philippa, for in her increased terror of discovery she almost exaggerated her precautions, and scarcely ventured to leave her own room. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she was sitting by the open window of her sister's apartment, which looked out on the front of the house, when the sound of wheels caught her attention, and glancing out she saw a dog-cart coming round from the stables. It was hidden from view for a few minutes as it stood under the large porch, but the sound of voices and laughter reached her ears, telling their own tale, as she distinguished, \"good-bye, old fellow,\" \"too bad of you,\" and the like. And in another...", "...he would go away. Then, growing a little more collected, she considered the second point. Though Hall and Farquhar had cast considerable doubt upon his ability to help, there was just a possibility that Hunter might hold out a hand, and she would stoop to beg for any favor that might be shown her lover. This latter decision, however, she prudently determined to keep from Thorne in the meanwhile. By and by she walked quietly back to the house and busied herself as usual, though late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she asked Mrs. Farquhar for a horse and the buggy. Her employer did not trouble her with any questions as to why she wanted them, though she favored her with a glance of unobtrusive but very keen scrutiny, and soon after supper the hired man brought the buggy to the door. Then Alison came out from her room, where she had spent some time carefully comparing the two or three dresses she had clung to when she had parted with the rest in Winnipeg, one after another. She...", "...made good his word to stop the next train, which proved to be a local, and there was not so much grumbling by the train crew as there would have been had the train been a limited one. The horseback ride that day was a hard one, but all were used to the saddle, and Sheriff Ford, himself a \"rough-rider,\" was interested in the riding of the three Overlanders. By this time he had grown to understand Stacy Brown better, and his laughter at the boy's sallies was loud and appreciative. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the delayed party rode into Gardner where a warm welcome awaited them from the Overland girls, who had already arranged for a posse to go out to look for the missing ones. The authorities were keenly interested in the information that Sheriff Ford and the three Overland men had to offer, and declared their intention of starting out in an effort to round up the gang. That evening there was a genuine reunion of the Overlanders at which their further plans were...", "...chief. \"You can get down, now, Antrim.\" He drew the pistol from Red King's mane, where it had been concealed during Antrim's talk with his men, and sheathed it.

The company corral was empty; and again, as on the day before Kane Lawler had visited him, Gary Warden stood at one of the windows of his office smiling. Warden was almost satisfied. Only one disturbing thought persistently recurred; Lawler had got his cattle through to Red Rock.

The Sermon was afterwards published by Knox, in order, as he says, \"to let such as Satan hes not altogether blinded, see upon how small occasions great offence is now conceived.\" Immediately John Knox was commanded...", "...and gradually it dawned upon us that our troops, instead of advancing, had retired. Fortunately, the enemy had retired at the same time in the opposite direction. Otherwise I should now be somewhere in captivity. We passed through the village of Robelmont where, on the previous day, we had seen our Infantry in occupation. We encountered one of the inhabitants and asked him what had become of our soldiers. He looked very happy and assured me that the Germans had departed.

The steamer did not proceed at any great pace, as it was towing behind it one of the heavy convict barges, and although the passage is ordinarily performed in a day and a half, it took them nearly a day longer to accomplish, and it was not until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the third day that Tobolsk came in sight. Through his port-hole Godfrey obtained a good view of the town, containing nearly 30,000 inhabitants, with large government buildings, and a great many houses built of stone. It is built in a very unhealthy position, the country round being exceedingly low and marshy. After passing Tobolsk they entered the Obi, one of the largest rivers in Asia. The next morning the steamer again started for her sixteen-hundred-mile journey...", "...expected to meet him in our dogs' home looking for a greyhound to go coursing with on Primrose Hill,--and here he was standing up on his hind legs, and making an application to the court which my lord was never in his life known to grant. It was the night before the Derby, and we always took care to have a full list of cases for that Wednesday, for _fear_ the public should think we went to the Derby and left the work to look after itself. We generally had about a dozen in pretty early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of Tuesday, so that the suitors and witnesses, solicitors and all others whom it concerned, might know where they were, and that _they_ could not go to the Derby the following day. What a scene it was as soon as this list was published! I used to sit and watch the various applicants sidle into their seats with the most sheepish faces for men I ever saw. In came the first gentleman, flustered with excitement. \"Would your lordship allow me to make an...", "...coming. \"Oh, not many--about half a dozen--mostly ladies down for the wedding.\" George at first swore warmly; then he began to appreciate the affair as a joke. Mrs. Saxton hoped they wouldn't want her to provide them pots, for she hadn't two cups that matched, nor had any of her spoons the least pretence to silver. The children were hugely excited, and wanted a holiday from school, which Emily at once vetoed firmly, thereby causing family dissension. As we went round the field <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> turning the hay, we were thinking apart, and did not talk. Every now and then--and at every corner--we stopped to look down towards the wood, to see if they were coming. \"Here they are!\" George exclaimed suddenly, having spied the movement of white in the dark wood. We stood still and watched. Two girls, heliotrope and white, a man with two girls, pale green and white, and a man with a girl last. \"Can you tell who they are?\" I asked. \"That's Marie Tempest, that...", "...the water, for the captain had made careful inquiries about the best fishing grounds, and the mishaps of Locker were so numerous and so provocative of queer remarks from himself, that the captain and Olive sometimes forgot to pull up their fish, so preengaged were they in laughing. The sky was bright, the water smooth, and even Mr. Locker caught fish, although it might have been thought that he did everything possible to prevent himself doing so. When their boat ran up the beach late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the captain and Olive were still laughing, and Mr. Locker was as sober as a soda-water fountain from which spouts such intermittent sparkle. Dear as was the toll-gate, this was a fine change from that quiet home. The next morning, upon the sand, Claude Locker approached Olive. \"Would you like to decline my addresses for the second time?\" he abruptly asked. \"Of course not\" she exclaimed. \"Well, then,\" said he, extending his hand, \"good-by!\" \"What are you...", "...line somewhere between Flatbush and Brockland; all the men were ordered out though it rained prodigiously; it was found, after some time, that it was a false alarm.

The very heavy rain, with intermixed thunder, continued for some hours till towards evening. In the night the battling on Long Island continued, and likewise, _Thursday 29th_; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> such heavy rain fell again as can hardly be remembered; nevertheless the operations on Long Island went on more or less; and behold, in the night, the Americans thought it advisable to retreat, and leave Long Island to the King's troops.

Good-bye, Laura.\" \"Good-bye,\" she said. And without taking her hand he left her. She watched his tall figure making its way quickly down through the rough ground to the wood where, ultimately, he would find a path which would lead him to his mother's house. * * * * * It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day. From where she was sitting, under a great cedar tree, Mrs. Tropenell at last saw her son Oliver and Godfrey Pavely come out of Freshley Manor. Though the glory and warmth of the summer were now over, Mrs. Tropenell still spent many hours of each day in her garden. She had always been an out-of-door woman from the days when she was an eager, impetuous, high-spirited girl, till now, when youth had gone, though something of the eager impetuosity of...", "...the day the _Mary Somerville_ was taken back to Deal. No more vivid picture of the perils through which the lifeboatmen passed could be desired than that of the bruised and battered lifeboat, as she lay high and dry in the boathouse that afternoon.

At daybreak next morning a tug was seen endeavouring to take the abandoned ship in tow, and about four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she was brought into Ramsgate harbour.

Arriving off Sandgate, the vessel became quite unmanageable, and it was decided to lie-to and wait until the fury of the storm had passed. Two anchors were accordingly let go, but these, even with...", "...faces to the Queen's Hotel on the water front. There I found Arthur Ruhl and James H. Hare, who had just come over from England. The hotel overlooked the River Scheldt, forming a wide crescent on the city's north, and was within fifty yards of one of the longest pontoon bridges constructed in modern warfare. Here was a sight to come again and rend the memory. The crowds were endeavoring to get away over one of the two avenues of escape still open. I estimated that between five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and the following dawn three hundred thousand persons must have passed through the city's gates. They were the people of Antwerp itself, swelled by exiles from Alost, Aerschot, Malines, Termonde, and other cities to the south and west.

But it required incessant eating of these to satisfy the appetite, and even then, hunger, in a short time, asserted its former sway. The morning following this discovery was so foggy that it was impossible to make a start before seven o'clock.

It was, therefore, with unfeigned delight that, late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the twenty-first of July, they discovered the placid waters of Itasca just ahead of them. Launching their canoes, they soon reached Schoolcraft Island, after a pull of about two miles, and prepared to make this point their headquarters.

I am tired to death,\" she murmured. \"The heat was killing; and the whole business interminably...", "...part of it away. And then I remembered Amos, and thought it my duty to take what steps I could to see that that dread man should never solve the riddle of the Red Fish, though it was unlikely he would find the place without the aid of my fragment of the map. The sight of all that gold had, as it were, unnerved me--filled me with a kind of weariness of life. I cannot say exactly how it was, but I know that I had lost, on a sudden, all my energy and enthusiasm; and it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before I bestirred myself and got to work.

We made some experiments, and found the stuff was superior to emery dust. It cut deeper and quicker, and only about half as much was required to do the work. We made up our minds we would keep what came on board, as it was better than the emery dust and much cheaper, so we gathered it up. \"That night there were more of the...", "...a silent barn.

As soon as a sufficient crowd had collected at the picnic grounds, they were to walk in procession with him down to the grove, and just at their entry into the woods to burst into song and march in twos up to the platform, waving their banners and singing of the glory of Canada. After this they were to be given the freedom of the woods until such time as the performance should commence. The idea had been Mr. Egerton's and had...", "...is Peleton coming this way, and Maubranne with him.\" \"And neither of them is your particular friend. Shall I see you to-morrow evening if the truce lasts as long?\" \"That depends on the Cardinal. If he doesn't require me I will be on the Pont Neuf at six, but don't stay after that time,\" and I walked off quickly, leaving Raoul to enter the courtyard of the palace a little before Peleton and the baron. The next day Mazarin was invisible to every one except his secretary, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a note bearing his seal was brought to me in my room. Opening it hastily, I read the contents with a feeling of disappointment, as they did away altogether with any chance of a pleasant evening with Raoul. \"You will attend me, well armed and cloaked, at seven o'clock this evening.\" \"What is in the wind now?\" I muttered. \"It seems that we have to go outside the Palace at all events. Perhaps the adventure has something to do with my discovery at Martin's house....", "...corn, maize, minerals, wood, cotton, water for machinery; every valuable and important produce, all requiring their more immediate attention. We had a pleasant ride home, and when we got back amongst the lanes leading to the village, stopped every moment to admire and wonder at the rare and beautiful blossoms on the trees; and pulled branches of flowers off them, more delicate and lovely than the rarest exotics in an English hothouse. This morning, the weather was damp and rainy, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we took a long walk, and visited several Indian cottages, all clean, and the walls hung with fresh mats, the floors covered with the same; and all with their kitchen utensils of baked earth, neatly hung on the wall, from the largest size in use, to little dishes and _jarritos_ in miniature, which are only placed there for ornament. We also went to purchase _gicaras_, and to see the operation of making and painting them, which is very curious. The flowers are not...", "...he asked Williamson. \"Certainly,\" said Williamson, producing a well-made gun-metal case, which he immediately returned to his pocket. \"I think I used the last there, but I have a box somewhere.\" He handed Whitney an ordinary card box containing pine matches. \"Thank you.\" As Whitney returned the box he noticed that Andrew was watching them. Then he glanced quickly at Elsie, but she was quietly knitting, with her eyes on the stitches. A few minutes afterward a servant brought <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> edition of a Glasgow newspaper. Staffer glanced at the front page and then sat down near one of the lamps. There was a certain deliberation in his movements that Whitney noticed, though he admitted that he might not have done so had not the matchbox incident roused him to suspicious vigilance. He thought Staffer was waiting for something, and in a moment or two Williamson left Dick and turned toward him. Then Staffer folded back the newspaper. \"The A. & P. liner...", "...said Mr. Havisham, \"that Lord Fauntleroy's impressions of you will depend entirely upon yourself. And if you will pardon the liberty I take in making the suggestion, I think you will succeed better with him if you take the precaution not to speak slightingly of his mother.\" \"Pooh, pooh!\" said the Earl. \"The youngster is only seven years old!\" \"He has spent those seven years at his mother's side,\" returned Mr. Havisham; \"and she has all his affection.\" V It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the carriage containing little Lord Fauntleroy and Mr. Havisham drove up the long avenue which led to the castle. The Earl had given orders that his grandson should arrive in time to dine with him; and for some reason best known to himself, he had also ordered that the child should be sent alone into the room in which he intended to receive him. As the carriage rolled up the avenue, Lord Fauntleroy sat leaning comfortably against the luxurious cushions, and...", "...my notice have not escaped Fanny's; she has found out even that he wears a wig, and that he paints his face. This poor little child is going to be invaluable to me. If all goes well with us we must take care of her. Indeed, I have promised as much. Now let me tell you what else I have done, and what has occurred. In the note you sent back by Fanny this morning, you express anxiety concerning me with reference to Richard Manx. Well, my dear, I intend to take great care of myself, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I went out shopping accompanied by Fanny. I paid a visit, being a woman, to a milliner and dressmaker, and bought some clothes. For myself? No, for Fanny, and with them a waterproof to cover her dress completely, from top to toe. Then I made my way to a wig shop in Bow Street, and bought a wig. For myself? No--again for Fanny. And, after that, where do you think I went? To a gunsmith, of all places in the world. There I bought a revolver--the tiniest, dearest little...", "...non-commissioned officers and men, 2,099 camels, and forty horses, paraded for inspection on the rising ground south of Korti, preparatory to the march across the Bayuda Desert. The baggage-camels were arranged in columns, with from twenty to thirty marching abreast, and with fifty yards interval between each troop. The Guards in front and the Mounted Infantry in the rear were in close companies ready to dismount and form square at a moment's notice. Wolseley inspected the whole, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the cavalry scouts, under Major (afterwards Sir Herbert) Kitchener with some Arab guides, moved off in front. A little later the great column got in motion, striking straight off across the undulating and pebbly plain towards the distant horizon. It was a strange sight to see the camels, with their necks stretching out like ostriches and their long legs, moving off in military array, until the rising dust first blended desert, men, and camels in one uniform grey...", "...\"no could miss.\" \"It seems a pity to lose such a quantity of meat,\" Tom remarked. \"The Indians seldom carry off more than the hindquarters of a deer, never if they think there is a chance of getting more soon. There is a lot more flesh on the hindquarters than there is on the rest of the stag. But that they are wasteful, the red-skins are, can't be denied. Even when they have got plenty of meat they will shoot a buffalo any day just for the sake of his tongue.\" It was still early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they passed under the shadow of the buttes, and, two miles farther, came upon a small lake, the water from which ran north. Here they unsaddled the horses and prepared to camp. CHAPTER V IN DANGER There were no bushes that would serve their purpose near the lake; they therefore formed their camp on the leeward side of a large boulder. The greatest care was observed in gathering the fuel, and it burned with a clear flame without giving out the...", "...I won't say no.\" \"A year? But in a year I may be dead.\" \"You come to me,\" said Rose, \"if you're dyin'.\" \"And you'll have me then?\" he said savagely. \"Yes. I'll 'ave you then.\" But, though all night Tanqueray by turns raged and languished, it was Rose who, in the morning, looked about to die. Not that he saw her. He never saw her all that day. And at evening he listened in vain for her call at the gate, her salutation to the night: \"Min--Min--Minny! Puss--Puss--Puss!\" For <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Rose left the house, attended by her uncle, who carried by its cord her little trunk. In her going forth she wore a clean white linen gown. She wore, not the Hat, nor yet the sad thing that Tanqueray had sat on, but a little black bonnet, close as a cap, with a black velvet bow in the front, and black velvet strings tied beneath her chin. It was the dress she had worn when she was nurse in a gentleman's family. V Late in the evening of that day,...", "...within him. He could not laugh with Keok and Nawadlook, or give the old tundra call to Amuk Toolik and his people, who would be riotous in their happiness at his return. They loved him. He knew that. Their love had been a part of his life, and the knowledge that his response to this love would be at best a poor and broken thing filled him with dread. A strange sickness crept through his blood; it grew in his head, so that when noon came, he did not trouble himself to eat. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when he saw far ahead of him the clump of cottonwoods near the warm springs, very near his home. Often he had come to these old cottonwoods, an oasis of timber lost in the great tundras, and he had built himself a little camp among them. He loved the place. It had seemed to him that now and then he must visit the forlorn trees to give them cheer and comradeship. His father's name was carved in the bole of the greatest of them all, and under it the date and day when the...", "...got up at six and, after a bathe from Shark Point, walked all round Samson and refreshed his soul by gazing upon the Outer Islands. Breakfast over, he took a pipe in the farmyard with Justinian and Peter, who continually talked of shipwrecks and of things washed ashore. During this interval Armorel made the puddings and the cakes. When she had accomplished this delicate and responsible duty, she came out, prepared for the day. They took their dinner-basket with them, and sallied forth: <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they returned: in the evening, at seven o'clock, the table was pushed back: the old serving people came in; the fire was stirred into animation; Armorel played the old-fashioned tunes; and the ancient lady rallied, and sat up, and talked, her mind in the past. All the days alike, yet each one differing from its neighbours. There is no monotony, though place and people remain exactly the same, when there is the semblance of variety. For, besides the discovery of so many...", "...going over the ledge ahead, but the rest of us had no time to jump, and a moment later the bottom fell out of our track and we felt ourselves dropping through space. It was a fall of only fifteen feet, but in the night it seemed a hundred. Fortunately we landed on soft snow and no harm was done, but we had a good shaking up. The storm grew in force with the coming of daylight. Forging on through the driving snow we reached the ocean ice early in the forenoon and at four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the shelter of an Eskimo hut. The storm was so severe the next morning our Eskimos said to venture out in it would probably mean to get lost, but before noon the wind so far abated that we started. The snow fell thickly all day, the wind began to rise again, and a little after four o'clock the real force of the gale struck us in one continued, terrific sweep, and the snow blew so thick that we nearly smothered. The temperature was thirty degrees below zero. We...", "...resolve was taken, she would not falter. If she reasoned with her conscience it was thus: \"The plan is not mine--I could not help it. These men are false and desperate; I can guide but not defeat them. When it is done--oh, how my heart beats; its chains are falling off. His petty sins shall bind me here no longer.\" CHAPTER VII. ARRIVAL OF THE GUEST. It was Saturday evening; the moon rose upon a scene which utterly changed the whole aspect of the ranche. Since early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the road from the mines had been filled with men, who poured down into the valley to seek relaxation after their week's successful toil, and relieve themselves, perhaps, of every ounce of the yellow dust which they had labored so hard to gain. About the tents and cabins were grouped scores of men from every nation of the civilized world. Long tables had been set out in the open air, covered with such food as the owners of the huts could procure; barrels of liquor...", "...from the text, 'and Pharoh said unto Jacob, how old art thou?' It was full of humility and self-reproach. I saw Mr. Walker, Bishop Johns, Bishop Atkinson, etc. I have not been able to attend any other services, and presume the session will not be prolonged. I suppose it may be considered a small attendance. Should Custis arrive during my absence, I will leave word for him to take my room at the Spotswood till my return. Smith [His brother, S. S. Lee, C. S. N.] is well and enjoys a ride <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with Mrs. Stannard. The charming women, you know, always find him out. Give much love to Cousin Anna, Nannie, and dear daughters. When Rob leaves the University take him with you. \"Truly and affectionately, R. E.

My brother, Custis, had joined my father in Richmond, the girls had gone to Fauquier county, to visit relatives, and my mother to Ravensworth, about ten miles from Arlington towards...", "...enemy twice in such a blunder.\" He swept with his field-glass the masses of the enemy before him, then seized the arm of Marshal Ney. \"You see the Russians and the town of Friedland,\" he said. \"March straight forward; seize the town; take the bridges, whatever it may cost. Do not trouble yourself with what is taking place around you. Leave that to me and the army.\" The troops were coming in rapidly, and marching to the places assigned them. The hours moved on. It was half-past five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the cannon sounded the signal of the coming fray. [=The Assault of the Indomitable Ney=] Meanwhile Ney's march upon Friedland had begun. A terrible fire from the Russians swept his ranks as he advanced. Aided by cavalry and artillery, he reached a stream defended by the Russian Imperial Guard. Before those picked troops the French recoiled in temporary disorder; but the division of General Dupont, marching briskly up, broke the Russian guard, and the pursuing...", "...of Versailles, was extremely scandalised to see this temple of prudery thus profaned. Its goddess and he formerly would have been less shocked. The Czar and his people were not accustomed to restraint. The expenses of this Prince amounted to six hundred crowns a day, though he had much diminished his table since the commencement. On Sunday, the 30th of May, he set out with Bellegarde, and many relays, to dine at Petit Bourg, with D'Antin, who received him there, and took him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to see Fontainebleau, where he slept, and the morrow there was a stag-hunt, at which the Comte de Toulouse did the honours. Fontainebleau did not much please the Czar, and the hunt did not please him at all; for he nearly fell off his horse, not being accustomed to this exercise, and finding it too violent. When he returned to Petit Bourg, the appearance of his carriage showed that he had eaten and drunk a good deal in it. On Friday, the 11th of June, he went from...", "...reporters call \"sensation in court.\" What! Had it come to this, that one of the chief institutions of the land--a very pillar of the crown and government--namely, _jury-packing_, was to be reflected upon from the bench itself. Monstrous! The charge, though mild in language, was pretty sharp on the \"criminality\" of such conduct as was _imputed_ to the accused, yet certainly left some margin to the jury for the exercise of their opinion upon \"the law and the facts.\" At two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the jury retired to consider their verdict, and as the judges at the same moment withdrew to their chamber, the pent-up feelings of the crowded audience instantly found vent in loud Babel-like expressions and interchange of comments on the charge, and conjectures as to the result. \"Waiting for the verdict\" is a scene that has often been described and painted. Everyone of course concluded that half-an-hour would in any case elapse before the anxiously watched jury-room...", "...mishap which had befallen the boat, and asked if he might take Missy out to see her. \"To be sure! to be sure!\" said Captain January. \"That'll be a nice trip for ye, Honeysuckle. Put on your bunnit and go with Bob. He'll take good care of ye, Bob will.\" And so, by what seemed the merest chance, that lovely afternoon, little Star went with Bob Peet, in his old black boat, to see the steamer _Huntress_ aground on a sand-bank off the main shore. The sea lay all shining and dimpling <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> light, and not a cloud was to be seen overhead. Here and there a white gull was slowly waving his wings through the clear air, and little fish came popping their heads out of the water, just for the pleasure of popping them back again. Star dipped her hands in the blue crystal below, and sang little snatches of song, being light of heart and without a care in the world. They were no nursery songs that she sang, for she considered herself to have outgrown the very few...", "...had been put to some inconvenience in giving them an audience, being busily engaged at the time in pressing business. The petition, however, was of importance, and would receive their consideration at a convenient time.(736) (M355) On Friday the 10th the Commons were pressed for an answer, but they again put the matter off on the plea of pressure of business. The next day the deputation again waited on the House, attended by the city members of parliament, and about four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> received a message from the Commons that the City's petition was not to be forwarded to the king, and that \"in convenient time\" they would send and inform the Common Council of their further pleasure. Accordingly two of the city's members, Sir Thomas Soame and Samuel Vassall, appeared before the council on the 15th, when Vassall declared that he had been commanded by the House to make an explanation. In order to avoid mistakes he would read the message he was to...", "...Suddenly the stillness is broken by tinkling bells, the oxen; and immediately there is a tramp of rushing hoofs. Three men on horseback gallop through the entrance, and on their heels the cattle; the riders turn sharply round, a door is swung to behind them, and the oxen, with the bulls in their midst, pound through the ring. * * * The doors are opened two hours before the performance. Through the morning the multitude has trooped to the Plaza San Fernando to buy tickets, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> all Seville wends its way towards the ring. The road is thronged with people, they walk in dense crowds, pushing one another to get out of the way of broken-down shays that roll along filled with enthusiasts. The drivers crack their whips, shouting: '_Un real, un real a los Toros!_'{a} The sun beats down and the sky is intensely blue. It is very hot, already people are blowing and panting, boys sell fans at a halfpenny each. '_Abanicos a perra chica!_'{b} When you...", "...spaces, up and down steps, and into a court where cypresses grew. We set up our beds in a verandah, and woke to see leaves against the morning sky. We explored the vast temple and its monuments--iron vessels of the Tang age, a great tablet of the Sungs, trees said to date from before the Christian era, stones inscribed with drawings of these by the Emperor Chien Lung, hall after hall, court after court, ruinous, overgrown, and the great crumbling walls and gates and towers. Then <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we began the ascent of Tai Shan, the most sacred mountain in China, the most frequented, perhaps, in the world. There, according to tradition, legendary emperors worshipped God. Confucius climbed it six centuries before Christ, and sighed, we are told, to find his native State so small. The great Chin-Shih-Huang was there in the third century B.C. Chien Lung in the eighteenth century covered it with inscriptions. And millions of humble pilgrims for thirty centuries at...", "...am,\" said the girl, thanking her father with a kiss, and smiling at her mother so wistfully that the good woman could not refuse. \"You may have anything you like out of the blue chest. There's a lot of things there that the moths got at after Grandma died, and I couldn't bear to throw or give 'em away. Trim up your room as you like, and mind you don't forget your part of the bargain,\" answered Mrs. Grant, seeing profit in the plan. \"I won't; I'll work all the morning to-morrow, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I'll get ready to show you what I call a nice, pretty room,\" answered Merry, looking so pleased it seemed as if another flower had blossomed in the large bare kitchen. She kept her word, and the very stormy afternoon when Jill got into trouble, Merry was working busily at her little bower. In the blue chest she found a variety of treasures, and ignoring the moth holes, used them to the best advantage, trying to imitate the simple comfort with a touch of elegance...", "...the best thing for her would be plenty of exercise. That forenoon she insisted on carrying Hazel's pack, and did more real work on the trail than any other girl of the party. They were above the timber line, though there was little timber below it, the side of the mountain having been fire-swept long before that. The only green to be seen immediately about them were the blue-berry bushes and similar mountain vegetation that flourished in the crevices of the rocks. It was early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they emerged on the summit of the mountain and gazed off over its gray top, that, flanked by other domes of the Sandwich range, reminded one of the past ages and the fascinating legends of the Sokokis. The summit was rough and rugged, though devoid of big boulders such as are usually to be found in similar locations. \"You are now three thousand five hundred feet in the air,\" announced the guide, rather proudly. \"Ith that what maketh Buthter tho uppithh thith...", "...full clang, and in the next trial Bayard very nearly had his arm broken, but he won from his opponent a little casque adorned with plumes. Then came Bellabre and a formidable Scottish captain, named David Fergus, who was greatly renowned for his strength and skill. When the first day's contest was over, there was joyous feasting and dancing in Ayre until midnight, and the next morning all the knights went to mass, after which they dined together in good fellowship, and at two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they repaired to the arena to complete the trial. And at evening, when they had all done their part in the sport, and the air was filled with shouting and merry talking, the trumpets were sounded to command silence, and to Bayard was awarded the honour of decreeing the prizes. The young knight protested that he was not worthy of so great an honour, and was about to withdraw, but the people present insisted that he should adjudge them, and no other, because he had fought...", "...I tell you he was unexpected? He has an uncomfortable trick,\" complained Miss Elliot, \"just when everything is smooth and lovely, of suddenly leveling those gray-blue eyes of his at you, like two pistols. 'Throw up your hands and tell me what you really mean!' One doesn't always want to tell what one really means.\" \"Bet you have to with him, sooner or later,\" returned her friend. This conversation took place at the Vanes' _al fresco_ tea, to which Hal came for a few minutes, late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of his father's visit with McQuiggan, mainly in the hope of seeing Esme Elliot. Within five minutes after his arrival, Worthington society was frowning, or smiling, according as it was masculine or feminine, at their backs, as they strolled away toward the garden. Miss Esme was feeling a bit petulant, perhaps because of Kathie Pierce's final taunt. \"I think you aren't living up to our partnership,\" she accused. \"Is it a partnership, where one party is absolute...", "...thirsty,\" she commented wisely. Watering them was hard, tiresome work, for one big tub in the center of the yard evidently served the whole barn. When she had pumped that full--and how her arms ached!--she led the horses out, and after them, the cows. She was afraid to let either horses or cows have all they wanted, and jerking them back to their stalls before they had finished was not easy. She carried pailful after pailful of water to the pigs and the chickens and it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before she had the satisfaction of knowing that every animal, if not content, was much more comfortable than before her arrival. \"Now I think I've earned something to eat!\" she confided to Clover, when, hot and tired and flushed with the heat, she had filled the last chicken yard pan. \"And I'm going up to the house and help myself from the pantry. I'm 'most sure the kitchen door is unlocked; no one around here ever locks the back door.\" She was very hungry by this...", "...of the others, and the unpleasant situation in which they were placed, by remaining a clog upon Captain Drawlock, who would not quit his ship until he had surrendered up his charge. By inquiry of the dubashes, Captain Drawlock found out that an old Colonel Revel was residing at his Bungalo, about two miles distant from the fort, and supposing him not to be aware of the arrival of his grand-nieces, he despatched Newton Forster to acquaint him with the circumstance. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Newton arrived at the residence of the colonel, when he perceived immediately that every thing was on the establishment of an old Indian nabob. A double set of palanquin-bearers were stretched under the verandas; syces were fanning the horses with their chowries; tailors and various craftsmen were at work in the shade, while a herd of consumers, butlers, and other Indian domestics, were loitering about, or very busy doing nothing. It will be necessary, before...", "...rest of that long, hazy, dreamy, wonder day, in the morning of which our hearts had been poured so full, we all of us spent with father, as he was to leave us the next morning. Against the remonstrance of his maternal parent, the worthless Jefferson had been chosen to go along in the place of his father Dabney. The young negro's brisk packings filled the house with a joy note that was delightful and Mammy admonished him on subjects moral every time he came near the kitchen. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I left father down in the garden with young Nickols, to whom he was confiding the care of some very choice hollyhock seeds that would need gathering in the next few weeks. \"Your father got them from England,\" the judge said gravely, as he showed the small paddies how to roll out the thin seed without crushing them. \"Have I got any father but the Lady?\" asked the youngster with all seriousness, as he beamed up in my direction. Suddenly Martha turned and went...", "...that little girl. She could go twice the pace!\" Blanca's answer, deferred for a few seconds, was: \"Hilary perhaps knows.\" \"Do you dislike her coming here?\" asked Hilary. \"Not particularly. Why?\" \"I thought from your tone you did.\" \"I don't dislike her coming here for that purpose.\" \"Does she come for any other?\" Cecilia, dropping her quick glance to her fork, said just a little hastily: \"Father is extraordinary, of course.\" But the next three days Hilary was out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the little model came. This, then, was the other reason, on the morning of the first of May, which made him not averse to go and visit Mrs. Hughs in Hound Street, Kensington.

Nearly all their doors were open, and on the doorsteps babes and children were...", "...I slyly opened the package, took out the \"goobers,\" and replaced them with paper and saw-dust.

There was another incident which happened during one of the hottest summers in Richmond, when the mercury ranged from ninety-five to ninety-eight degrees in the shade; the clerks in the store took it by turns <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to go down into the basement, where it was cool and dark, and stretch themselves out on a pile of goods for a quiet nap, as there was nothing much doing up stairs. So one afternoon I went down there for my turn to sleep and fixed myself very comfortably; was soon sleeping as sweetly as an infant, when down came Weisiger, on mischief bent, took away my gaiters that I had removed from my feet and filled them up with paper, stuffed and rammed in hard, after which he...", "...with it. It is always best to follow the local customs with regard to dress and it is absurd for one man to appear at a formal morning affair in the cutaway coat when he knows that all of the other gentlemen present will be in their simple business suits. For formal afternoon affairs the cutaway is worn while for dinner in the evening full dress is prescribed as it is for any formal entertainment which takes place after six o'clock. To informal garden parties and other similar affairs <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> during the summer, flannels may be worn. There are special sporting outfits designed for the man who golfs, plays tennis, rides or motors and the best guide to all of these is a reliable haberdasher. It is his business to keep up with the details of dress and since these are constantly in process of change it is obviously impossible for a book of etiquette to lay down precise rules as to what should be worn. If a man is to escort a woman he should adapt his...", "...been the regular meeting, it is possible that Jacob might have sat in his corner as usual, supposing himself to be attending to the words of Deacon Scott and old Mr Wainwright, and all the rest of them, and through habit and the associations of time and place, he might have fallen into old trains of thought which did not always exclude a glance over the business of the day, or a glance toward the business of to-morrow; and so the unwonted stir of fears and feeling which had moved him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> might have been set at rest, and the cloud of care and pain dissolved for the time. But Mr Maxwell had the word, and still moved and troubled, Jacob could not but listen with the rest. It was not the minister's usual way to give one of his elaborate written discourses on such an occasion as the present. There might be a difference of opinion among the people now and then, as to whether he gave them something better, or something not so good. But to-night the...", "...I have not yet made that visit to the salmon-fishers at Sunburst. Unfortunately, on the days when I called on Miss Devlin, my time was limited. But now I have a thirst for adventure, and time hangs heavy. Will you perform your old office of escort, and join a party, which we can make up here, to go there to-morrow?\" I had little love for Mrs. Falchion, but I consented, because it seemed to me the chance had come for an effective talk with her; and I suggested that we should go late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the next day, and remain till night and see the Indians, the half-breeds, and white fishermen working by torch-light on the river. The proposition was accepted with delight. Then the conversation turned upon the feud that existed between Viking and Sunburst, the river-drivers and the fishers. During the last few days, owing to the fact that there were a great many idle river-men about, the river-driving for the season being done, there had been more than one...", "...to know.

I arrived there early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> safe and sound, and greatly benefited by the trip. Like the beatings received by Brusa, the experience was delightful when it was over.

No traveler who desires...", "...One of my appropriations was a very long linen coat, with a huge collar, enormous cuffs, and large flaps over the pockets, a relic of former days. This, and a large Confederate hat, I donned as we returned with our captured goods, and my appearance was the source of much amusement to the boys and wonderment to others. Until this attire was discarded I passed for a citizen prisoner, and many questioning remarks of an amusing character were overheard as I walked to and fro. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we were marched about three miles out in the country, and there we camped for the night, being well fed for the first time, but it being the first opportunity of the rebels to feed us well. Our meal was of ash cakes, made of dough rolled in leaves and baked in the ashes of the fires by the negroes. This was the first food given to the negroes with us, and, during the march, I saw a colored woman walking painfully along with a child in her arms and two small ones...", "...is very wonderful; in the foreground of the huge picture, the forest of mountain tops, while westward in the distance is the fabled and saint-blessed Mare Brendanicum of the old writers, where the fiords embroider the coast line. Descents from Mangerton may be made due south from the eastern angle along the Oubeg to Kilgarvan, five miles east from Kenmare; by the \"Horse's Glen,\" from Lough Garagary, across the moor to the commencement of the bridle-path. Neither way is recommended <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> or without a guide. The best route to Carntuol is from the entrance to the Gap of Dunloe. There is a beaten track by the side of the waterway of the mountain stream, called \"Giddagh,\" the bed of which is filled with glacial moraines, leading into a romantic valley, the Hag's Glen, which is shut in by the Reeks and Knocknabinaneen. The dark tarn in the Glen, as well as every object of prominence, has been seized upon by the imaginative peasants, and associated in some...", "...me a curtsey like a peasant woman in a play--\"and they took my key from me, and the policeman opens the door, and he and me go upstairs and into all the rooms, and when we come to this one----\" She was getting so excited as to be hardly intelligible. Stopping herself with a jerk, she fumbled nervously with her apron, while I asked myself how she could have been at work in this house the day before without my knowing it. Suddenly I remembered that I was ill in the morning and busy <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at the Orphan Asylum, and somewhat relieved at finding so excellent an excuse for my ignorance, I looked up to see if the detective had noticed anything odd in this woman's behavior. Presumably he had, but having more experience than myself with the susceptibility of ignorant persons in the presence of danger and distress, he attached less importance to it than I did, for which I was secretly glad, without exactly knowing my reasons for being so. \"You will be wanted...", "...the fisherman, who had brought her and the Widow Constance's Barbara up the river in his boat, would be going back with the tide. She was not loath to leave: the green meadow, the gaudy Maypole, and the music were good, but the silence on the river, the shadow of the brooding forest, the darting of the fish hawk, were better. In the meadow the boys' race and the rustic dance were soon over. The dinner at the Jaquelin house to its guests lasted longer, but it too was hurried; for <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Mr. Harrison's mare Nelly was to run against Major Burwell's Fearnaught, and the stakes were heavy. Not all of the company went from the banquet back to the meadow, where the humbler folk, having eaten their dinner of bread and meat and ale, were whiling away with sports of their own the hour before the race. Colonel Byrd had business at Williamsburgh, and must reach his lodgings there an hour before sunset. His four black horses brought to the door the great...", "...a broad and tolerant smile. At present, ambition consumes me. I was ambitious before I was breeched. I can remember wondering as a child if I were a young Macaulay or Ruskin and secretly deciding that I was. My infant mind even was bitter with those who insisted on regarding me as a normal child and not as a prodigy. Since then I have struggled with this canker for many a day, and as success fails to arrive it becomes more gnawing. _October_ 24. In the morning a Town Council and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a Rural Council. With this abominable trash in my notebook waiting to be written up and turned into \"copy,\" and with the dream pictures of a quiet studious life in Cromwell Road not yet faded from my mind, where can I turn for consolation? That I have done my best? That's only a mother's saying to her child. Perhaps after all it is a narrow life--this diving and delving among charming little secrets, plying diligently scalpel and microscope and then weaving the...", "...on both sides, trench raids, and counterattacks, which resulted in some successes for the Allied troops, marked the following days. On October 21, 1916, the Germans lost heavily in an attempt to recover Sailly-Saillisel from the French. Three regiments of the Second Bavarian Division recently arrived in this sector were shattered one after the other by French curtain and machine-gun fire. South of the Somme a brilliant little success was achieved by the French north of Chaulnes. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the French infantry after a heavy bombardment of the enemy lines pushed forward and gained a foothold in the Bois Etoile which was held by troops of Saxony. The Chaulnes garrison attempted to come to the support of the Saxons, but were driven back by the destructive fire from French batteries. Generals Marchand and Ste. Clair Deville, who were wounded in fighting in the Somme region, continued to hold their commands and to direct the action of the French troops under...", "...the sky. \"She's wonderful mad because she didn't get us,\" remarked Dan. \"My! But weren't we lucky to drift in last night!\" said Paul, shuddering at the scene. \"'Tweren't luck,\" corrected Dan. \"Th' Lord were sendin' us in ahead o' th' blow. Dad says 'tain't luck, but th' Lord, as helps folks out o' bad places.\" After an unsatisfactory breakfast of beans, Dan shouldered his rifle, cautioned Paul not to go out of sight of the tent, and started out to explore and hunt. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he returned with a big gray goose and a rabbit. Paul, who was in the tent, sprang up when Dan pulled back the flap and looked in. \"Oh, but I'm glad to see you, Dan!\" he exclaimed. \"I never was so dead lonesome in my life!\" \"'Tis a bit lonesome bidin' alone in camp,\" admitted Dan, \"but see now what I'm gettin',\" and he dropped his game at Paul's feet. \"A goose and a rabbit!

Mirza, always cheerful and hard-working, though always slow, and Johannes did their best, but it is very hard on servants who are up before five not to bring them in till sunset, when their work is scarcely over till near midnight, and has to be done in the dark. The next day there were a succession of dust storms and half a gale from noon to sunset, but my tent stood it well, and the following day this was repeated. These strong winds usually prevail <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at this season. _Urmi, October 8._--A march over low and much-ploughed hills, an easy descent and a ford brought us down upon the plain of Urmi, the \"Paradise of Persia,\" and to the pleasant and friendly hamlet of Turkman, where I spent the night and made the half-march into Urmi yesterday morning. This plain is truly \"Paradise\" as seen from the hill above it, nor can I say that its charm disappears on more intimate acquaintance. Far from it! I have travelled now...", "...not!\" returned Berenice. Ten hours later Lucien awoke to meet Coralie's eyes. She had watched by him as he slept; he knew it, poet that he was. It was almost noon, but she still wore the delicate dress, abominably stained, which she meant to lay up as a relic. Lucien understood all the self-sacrifice and delicacy of love, fain of its reward. He looked into Coralie's eyes. In a moment she had flung off her clothing and slipped like a serpent to Lucien's side. At five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Lucien was still sleeping, cradled in this voluptuous paradise. He had caught glimpses of Coralie's chamber, an exquisite creation of luxury, a world of rose-color and white. He had admired Florine's apartments, but this surpassed them in its dainty refinement. Coralie had already risen; for if she was to play her part as the Andalusian, she must be at the theatre by seven o'clock. Yet she had returned to gaze at the unconscious poet, lulled to sleep in bliss; she...", "...Meanwhile, General Hampton, who had conjectured that I would try to get the train across the James by the pontoon-bridge at Deep Bottom, began concentrating all his troops except Lomax's brigade, which was to confront the head of my column on the river road, in the vicinity of Nance's Shop. This was discovered by Gregg at an early hour, and divining this purpose he had prepared to meet it by constructing hasty cover for his men before receiving my instructions. About 4 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Hampton got his force in hand, and with Fitzhugh Lee's division assailed the whole front of Gregg's line, and his left flank with Chambliss's and Geary's brigades. For two hours he continued to attack, but made little impression on Gregg--gain at one point being counterbalanced by failure at another. Because of the evident strength of Hampton, Gregg had placed all his troops in line of battle from the first, and on discovery of the enemy's superior numbers sent...", "...in the name of her husband, of all as she chose. At the same time he sent the key back, that it might be at hand if any documents were wanted. That was his trump card. With the feeling that his secret was near discovery he hastened to lead up to it, and possibly that very thing might prevent its revelation. He left orders to his agents that all letters concerning his affairs were to be directed to his wife. He was going away for a long time, but he did not say where to. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he started in a hired carriage. He hoped his track would be lost, and did not take his own horses. A couple of days ago he had been superstitious, and awaited signs from Heaven, from the elements, to show him the way. Now he noticed them no longer. He was determined to return to the island. But the sky and the elements tried to frighten him by evil omens, and even to detain him by force. Toward evening, when the long lines of poplars on the Danube shore were already in...", "...it again--I shall escape from Caspak.\" He was not looking at her face as he answered her, and so he did not see the shadow of sorrow that crossed her countenance. When he raised his eyes again, she was smiling. \"What you wish, I wish,\" said the girl. Southward along the coast they made their way following the beach, where the walking was best, but always keeping close enough to trees to insure sanctuary from the beasts and reptiles that so often menaced them. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the girl suddenly seized Bradley's arm and pointed straight ahead along the shore. \"What is that?\" she whispered. \"What strange reptile is it?\" Bradley looked in the direction her slim forefinger indicated. He rubbed his eyes and looked again, and then he seized her wrist and drew her quickly behind a clump of bushes. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"It is the most frightful reptile that the waters of the world have ever known,\" he replied. \"It is a German...", "...order should spring on to his lips without thinking; a certain sign should get itself made, so to speak, without reflection. But all unconscious alertness had abandoned me. I had to make an effort of will to recall myself back (from the cabin) to the conditions of the moment. I felt that I was appearing an irresolute commander to those people who were watching me more or less critically. And, besides, there were the scares. On the second day out, for instance, coming off the deck <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> (I had straw slippers on my bare feet) I stopped at the open pantry door and spoke to the steward. He was doing something there with his back to me. At the sound of my voice he nearly jumped out of his skin, as the saying is, and incidentally broke a cup. \"What on earth's the matter with you?\" I asked, astonished. He was extremely confused. \"Beg your pardon, sir. I made sure you were in your cabin.\" \"You see I wasn't.\" \"No, sir. I could have sworn I had heard...", "...you. If you will but sit half an hour in the room with Barbara, she herself will take you for her cousin, and there will be no further necessity for lying. That is why such things often succeed better in this class than in a higher one: education they have none, but they possess the proper capacity for belief. Only lose not courage yourself, and in that solitude there do not become a timid hare's foot. All may yet be well.\" With these and similar conversations they, at length, arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at the village in the centre of the mountains. The houses lay dispersed midway, or above the declivity of the mountain; each had a garden and shrubbery attached to it, and the church situated on the highest point, looked down on the lowly cottages. The little dwellings after which the travellers were obliged to inquire, stood at the extremity of the village, immediately over a rapidly flowing brook, a kitchen-garden was in front and a few chesnut, ash, and...", "...into the darkness and then had an inspiration. So staunch and well-kept was the brig that the deck seams were tight and no light filtered through. Joe left his hiding-place and groped along to where he thought the main hatch ought to be. Gazing upward he saw a gleam like a silvered line between the coaming and the edge of the canvas cover which was battened with iron bars. This persuaded him that the day had not yet faded, and he concluded that he had heard the bell strike either <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> watch or the second dog watch of early evening. This he imparted to Jack, after prodding him awake. They mulled it over and agreed that Captain Bonnet must have found the _Revenge_ unready to weigh anchor or he would have engaged the brig ere this. Perhaps there was not breeze enough for either vessel to move. Another hour of this stressful tedium and they heard a sound of sharp significance. It was the lap-lap of water against the vessel's side. No more than the...", "...old Lindau and the colonel, didn't they have a good time? I don't suppose they ever had a chance before to give their theories quite so much air. Oh, my! how they did ride over us! I'm just going down to see Beaton about the cover of the Christmas number. I think we ought to try it in three or four colors, if we are going to observe the day at all.\" He was off before March could pull himself together to ask what Dryfoos wanted at the office at that hour of the morning; he always came <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> on his way up-town. The fact of his presence renewed the sinister misgivings with which March had parted from him the night before, but Fulkerson's cheerfulness seemed to gainsay them; afterward March did not know whether to attribute this mood to the slipperiness that he was aware of at times in Fulkerson, or to a cynical amusement he might have felt at leaving him alone to the old man, who mounted to his room shortly after March had reached it. A sort of dumb...", "...after the others. We had not covered half the distance to the pool, however, when the light up there suddenly went out, and a minute later we heard the sound of galloping hoofs, muffled by the thin carpet of snow, going off in the direction of Sulphide. Our visitor, whoever he was, had departed. \"Well, come on, anyhow,\" said my father. \"Let us see what he was doing.\" As the thermometer was then standing at three degrees below zero, we knew that the sheet of clear water we had left <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> should have been solidly frozen over again by this time. What was our surprise, therefore, to find that such was not the case: there was only a thin film of ice; it was but just beginning to form. \"That is easily explained,\" remarked my father. \"The ice did form, but some one has chopped it out and thrown it to one side there. See?\" \"Yes,\" replied Joe, \"and then he took the ice-hook, which I know I left standing upright against the rocks, and poked up the ground...", "...He was thinking of bishoprics, and benefices, of smiling monarchs, patronizing prime ministers, and a \"much indebted muse.\" Of anything between these and eternal bliss he was but rarely and moderately conscious. Often, indeed, he sinks very much below even the bishopric, and seems to have no notion of earthly pleasure but such as breathes gaslight and the fumes of wine. His picture of life is precisely such as you would expect from a man who has risen from his bed at two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with a headache and a dim remembrance that he has added to his \"debts of honor:\" \"What wretched repetition cloys us here! What periodic potions for the sick, Distemper'd bodies, and distemper'd minds?\" And then he flies off to his usual antithesis: \"In an eternity what scenes shall strike! Adventures thicken, novelties surprise!\" \"Earth\" means lords and levees, duchesses and Dalilahs, South-Sea dreams, and illegal percentage; and the only...", "...she said; \"but only when we doubted of each other's love did we learn how valueless life was to us without it. Oh, Bernhard, how wretched we have been!\" \"And how blest we are once more,--each living in the other's heart!\" \"Oh, why is our child not with us?\" Thea cried. He kissed the tears from her eyes. \"He has been our guardian angel, my darling,\" he said. \"He has reunited us; for who can say how long we should have been estranged from each other without this sorrow?\" Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of this day Thea carried a bunch of white roses to the little chapel; Bernhard was with her, and as they entered he took one of the fragrant rosebuds from her hand and laid it on Lothar's coffin. \"_Requiescat in pace_,\" he whispered softly. Hand in hand they stood before their child's coffin, one in their sorrow, one in their love. The last rays of the setting sun streamed through the stained glass of the window and played upon the wreaths and palm branches, and...", "...around, out of range of the Black Fort and the works on the detached hills to the north-west of the city, to the Saltillo road. With this road in our possession, the enemy would be cut off from receiving further supplies, if not from all communication with the interior. General Worth, with his division somewhat reinforced, was given the task of gaining possession of the Saltillo road, and of carrying the detached works outside the city, in that quarter. He started on his march early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 20th. The divisions under Generals Butler and Twiggs were drawn up to threaten the east and north sides of the city and the works on those fronts, in support of the movement under General Worth. Worth's was regarded as the main attack on Monterey, and all other operations were in support of it. His march this day was uninterrupted; but the enemy was seen to reinforce heavily about the Bishop's Palace and the other outside fortifications on their left.

So it would, she owned with another sigh; and yet it seemed impossible. \"There, ma'am,\" said the driver, rising from his seat and facing round, while he pointed with his whip towards Quebec, \"that's what we call the Silver City.\" They looked back with him at the city, whose thousands of tinned roofs, rising one above the other from the water's edge to the citadel, were all a splendor of argent light <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sun. It was indeed as if some magic had clothed that huge rock, base and steepy flank and crest, with a silver city. They gazed upon the marvel with cries of joy that satisfied the driver's utmost pride in it, and Isabel said, \"To live there, there in that Silver City, in perpetual sojourn! To be always going to go on a morrow that never came! To be forever within one day of the end of a wedding journey that never ended!\" From far down the river by which they rode...", "...dedication in other ways than by material construction and costly furnishings.

The finishing touches to the interior of the building {159} were made late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of April 5th, and in the evening of that day, the Temple was thrown open to general inspection. Not only were members of the Church admitted; many honorable men and women who had never affiliated with the Church were invited to the number of over one thousand, and they passed through the Temple from basement to top. In view of the current belief that the Temples of the Latter-day Saints are never open to the gaze of non-members, this fact is of significant...", "...Normington, James Newbould and Samuel Johnson. Johnson afterwards promised obedience, and was released from the attachment, which was granted by the Court of Queen's Bench.

About 2 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the Guardians came out of the Devonshire yard in a conveyance, which, contrary to expectations, proceed along North-street. It was originally the intention of the driver to go to Bingley station, but fearing he would not have time for the journey, he pulled up at Keighley station. Here both platforms were besieged with demonstrative crowds. The train was missed, and the crowd unyoked the horses from the conveyance. A number of mechanics seized the shafts, and wheeled...", "...eaten all over as I was by mosquitoes and _piums_, while bees innumerable had settled on my face and arms. The latitude was 9 deg. 40'.4 S.; the longitude 58 deg. 34' W. The bees had a most peculiar pungent odour, which they seemed to leave on one's skin when they had walked on it. We kept our heads wrapped up in towels; but even then we suffered a great deal.

Fighting had been going on in that vicinity for some time before we arrived. Were ordered to throw up temporary breast-works, which was quickly accomplished. Early in the morning of the 21st, heavy artillery firing was heard on our right. The 6th and 8th Corps were engaged in a heavy battle that day, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> our Division was moved to the right of the 6th Corps and in front of Charlestown. In this engagement the loss was heavy on both sides. General Sheridan then drew his forces back to the rear of the defences of Harper's Ferry, at Halltown, the 19th Corps covering the movement. Our Regiment was put on picket duty behind Bolliver Heights, and a constant picket firing was kept up on both sides. On the 24th, our Regiment, with the 22d Iowa and 11th Indiana, under...", "...with a piano. A fine room for sound. The garden is beautiful. _Wednesday, March_ 31_st_.

They were Eton masters taking exercise. I didn't go to any picture galleries, but I walked about the streets and went into the Duomo, an ugly building inside. I got back for luncheon. Housman said that they must leave cards <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and take a drive in the Cascine. They went out in a carriage and pair. I went for a walk to the Boboli Gardens. At dinner Housman said they had met several friends, and he is giving a dinner-party on Sunday. _Thursday, April_ 1_st_. The Housmans took me to luncheon with a banker called Baron Strong. What the explanation of this title is I do not know. They live in the modern part of the town. He was a genial host, portly, with long white whiskers. His wife, the...", "...actions did not speak loud enough for me. Nothing but the words from her own dear lips, saying, \"Jasper, I love you,\" could convince me, unworthy as I was, that I could be aught to her. All the same I determined to go to her, I determined to see her, for my heart ached in my hunger to be near her, and my eyes would not be satisfied until they again feasted on her beauty. It was early in July when I landed in Falmouth Harbour. I think it was on the first of the month. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when I set foot on solid earth, but I did not stay in the town.

The tangled paths of the forest, and the narrow defiles of the mountains admit of no other. Even when passing a plain, our cavalcade was strung out for a quarter of a mile. The atajo followed in charge of the arrieros. For the first day of our march we kept on without nooning. There was neither grass nor water on the route; and a halt under the hot sun would not have refreshed us. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a dark line became visible, stretching across the plain. As we drew nearer, a green wall rose before us, and we distinguished the groves of cotton-wood. The hunters knew it to be the timber on the Paloma. We were soon passing under the shade of its quivering canopy, and reaching the banks of a clear stream, we halted for the night. Our camp was formed without either tents or lodges. Those used on the Del Norte had been left behind in \"cache.\" An expedition like...", "...kind of homes she may have been in before she came to you?

She gave up her place, and with a month's wages in her pocket went to the city. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when her train reached the station. Nellie alighted, bewildered and lonely. She had the address of an employment agency, furnished her by an acquaintance. Nellie slept that night, or rather tossed sleepless in the agency lodging house, on a dirty bed occupied by two women besides herself. In all her life she had never been inside such a filthy room, or heard such frightful conversation. Therefore next morning she gladly paid her exorbitant bill of one dollar and...", "...and teacher. We hope it may be done, then we would not have to travel any longer only in cases of need. Every one who has to travel ruins his health if he has to do it for a long time.

Accordingly, on the first evening after my arrival at Borden Tower, I was initiated into the mysteries of poker and Prussian bank, and on subsequent occasions I either joined them or looked on. The result in the main was pretty much as I had expected. De Cartienne won always when the stakes were very large, and Lord Silchester when they were scarcely worth having. The earlier part of the day was by far the pleasanter to me. In the morning we worked with Dr. Randall; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we always walked or rode--in either case, a visit to the \"Rose and Crown\" was an invariable part of the programme--and in the evening, after dinner, we were supposed to read until ten o'clock, although the manner in which we really spent that portion of the day was far less profitable. I had intended paying a special visit to Miss Milly Hart on my own account; but either by accident or design--at the time I was not sure which--de Cartienne always seemed to frustrate...", "...my dear noble enemy of the previous morning.

Then <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> or evening there is a long parade from the church through the main streets and back to the church again, with the figure of the saint standing on a flower-draped platform which is carried on the shoulders of young men. [Illustration] Choirs sing, candles and incense burn, and all the people stand in reverence along the route. A bullfight is usually a feature of a saint's day too, with the whole town going to the Plaza de Toros to watch. The paseo will be...", "...was the most faultless piece of road in the mountains, and the driver said he would \"let his team out.\" He did, and if the Pacific express trains whiz through there now any faster than we did then in the stage-coach, I envy the passengers the exhilaration of it. We fairly seemed to pick up our wheels and fly--and the mail matter was lifted up free from everything and held in solution! I am not given to exaggeration, and when I say a thing I mean it. However, time presses. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we arrived on the summit of Big Mountain, fifteen miles from Salt Lake City, when all the world was glorified with the setting sun, and the most stupendous panorama of mountain peaks yet encountered burst on our sight. We looked out upon this sublime spectacle from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow! Even the overland stage-driver stopped his horses and gazed! Half an hour or an hour later, we changed horses, and took supper with a Mormon \"Destroying Angel.\"...", "...\"Here goes, then,\" said King, and he swung himself up into the lower branches, keeping sharp watch lest his quarry elude him, and slip down the other side. But once fairly up in the tree, he found the whole five there awaiting him, and as they all dropped quickly to the ground, and ran for \"home\" he had to jump and follow, to get there first himself. The jolly game of Hide-and-Seek lasted the rest of the morning, and then the little guests went home, promising to come back <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and bring their contributions to the treasury of the \"Jinks Club.\" The afternoon meeting found the Maynards in spandy-clean clothes, sitting on the side veranda. \"Mother says we're not to romp this afternoon,\" explained Marjorie. \"She says we may swing, or play in the hammock, or on the lawn, but we can't go to the orchard.\" \"All right,\" said good-natured Dick; \"and, say, I've been thinking over our club, and I think we ought to be more like a real club. Why not...", "...mangroves, broken here and there by bayous, whose shallow bottoms were lush with rank vegetation. \"We get him there,\" said Raymon, pointing to one of these bayous. \"When sun going down. Plenty of manatee in dat place.\" Donalblane was impatient to begin the hunt right away; but Raymon knew his business better, and so they sought a landing in one of the cool, dark recesses of the mangrove forest, and, after eating their lunch, lay down for the inevitable siesta. It was well on <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before Raymon pronounced it time to get to work, and, thrilling with eagerness, Donalblane took his place in the stern of the canoe, his musket ready for a quick shot, while Raymon crouched in the bow, holding a harpoon to which was attached a long, thin rope. Noiselessly the expert paddlers sent the canoe over the bosom of the bayou, turning this way and that, in accordance with whispered directions from Raymon, whose keen eyes searched the still waters in front....", "...not a rupee of vast treasure, not a gem of the hoard of a century, had been saved from their hands. Within an hour they found their condition changed from being little better than that of a routed mob, to the possessors of an impregnable stronghold, a splendid armament of modern guns, a new force of ten thousand well drilled troops, stores and munitions of war in abundance. More than this the people of Gwalior received them, not as conquerors, but as champions of their race. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the Rani of Jhansi rode into Gwalior on the right hand of the Rao Sahib. Thousands of people came forth to meet her, shouting her name in a frenzy of joy. As she approached the gates, a salute of artillery burst from the fortress, high above their heads. She gazed upward to behold her banner replacing Sindhia's on the loftiest pinnacle. It was the result of Prasad's first order, on taking possession of the fortress in the name of the Rani of Jhansi, as well as that of...", "...was the pity and the trouble of it; he was able, however, to drop his problem at the door very much as if it had been the copper piece that he deposited, on the threshold, in the receptacle of the inveterate blind beggar. He trod the long dim nave, sat in the splendid choir, paused before the cluttered chapels of the east end, and the mighty monument laid upon him its spell. He might have been a student under the charm of a museum--which was exactly what, in a foreign town, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of life, he would have liked to be free to be. This form of sacrifice did at any rate for the occasion as well as another; it made him quite sufficiently understand how, within the precinct, for the real refugee, the things of the world could fall into abeyance. That was the cowardice, probably--to dodge them, to beg the question, not to deal with it in the hard outer light; but his own oblivions were too brief, too vain, to hurt any one but himself, and he had a...", "...it people there just out of curiosity?

Kneller never painted in a more masterly manner. 11th July, 1689. I dined at Lord Clarendon's, it being his lady's wedding day, when about three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> there was an unusual and violent storm of thunder, rain, and wind; many boats on the Thames were overwhelmed, and such was the impetuosity of the wind as to carry up the waves in pillars and spouts most dreadful to behold, rooting up trees and ruining some houses. The Countess of Sunderland afterward told me that it extended as far as Althorpe at the very time, which is seventy miles from London. It did no harm at Deptford, but at Greenwich it did much mischief....", "...chest and roaring with pain.

We were indignant and loudly expressed our determination not to enter these cars and travel like cattle. The officers who, no doubt, overheard us, must have been of the same opinion, for we were not ordered into the cars but stacked arms and waited about three hours until a number of cars with hard...", "...Carnieres, agree perfectly with the details of the combat in which the Gauls were defeated.

Caesar must have arrived on the territory of the Nervii, towards Cambrai, _the morning of the third day_, counting from his departure from Amiens, after marching ninety kilometres. He immediately sends the Gaulish horseman to Cicero. This horseman has to perform eighty kilometres. He can only take eight to nine hours, and arrive at the camp <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the third day. He throws his javelin, which remains where it was fixed _the third_ and _the fourth day_. The _fifth_ day it was discovered, and the smoke of the fires is then seen. Caesar, then, arrived on the fifth day (reckoning thirty kilometres for a day's march) at Binche, twenty kilometres from Charleroi.

He wanted to be in the open air and walk. Passing before the door of the cellar, he smiled. Nevertheless, he made sure of the strength of the hook fastening the door.

He had to struggle against the overpowering drowsiness that settled on him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at his office. His heavy, aching head nodded in spite of himself, but he abruptly brought it up, as soon as he heard the step of one of his chiefs. This struggle, these shocks completed wearing out his limbs, while causing him intolerable anxiety.

Each man's share of this consisted of one-third of a biscuit, one-third of an ounce of butter and a drink made of a spoonful of glaxo-and-sugar and one of absolute alcohol, mixed in a mug of lukewarm water. We could not afford oil enough to do much more than thaw the water, but the alcohol warmed us splendidly, enabling us to get a good rest. After an hour's spell we started again, luckily seeing just enough of the sun to check the course. The wind grew stronger <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and several times dense fog-banks drove down on us. Meeting one steep rise, we sidled round it for what seemed hours, but my chief memory of that afternoon was of the clouds of the northern horizon.

Artemisia still covers the plain, but _Purshia tridentata_ makes its appearance here on the hill-sides and on bottoms of the creeks--quite a tree in size, larger than the artemisia. We crossed several hollows with a little water in them, and improved grass; and, turning off from the road <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in search of water, traveled about three miles up the bed of a willow creek, towards the mountain, and found a good encampment, with wood and grass, and little ponds of water in the bed of the creek; which must be of more importance at other seasons, as we found there several old fixtures for fishing. There were many holes on the creek prairie, which had been made by the Diggers in search of roots. Wind increased to a violent gale from the N.W., with a temperature...", "...no let up.

The woodcutters returned late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and began carting their logs up the incline where they were dumped on the mud at the end of the corduroy to solidify the foundation of the extended roadway. The tree trunks were heavy and the men so weak that it took eight or ten of them to carry a single log.

Yet water will change even these blasted wastes, and, at the one or two stations where artesian wells have been successfully sunk, we saw high-grown trees and verdant gardens.

No cactus or even yucca here, and after climbing and crossing a long, dry ridge, we found ourselves descending into flat, sandy reaches, that bore even no shrubs or plants whatsoever, save a dead and somber sedgy grass in sparse, feeble bunches, and while the land looked wet we saw no water. Then far to the southeast glimmered a silver streak, so faint that it seemed no...", "...and the next day, we remained in camp, but spent a good deal of time roaming over the town, and buying bread and whatever else we could find to eat. Although the first day was Sunday, the Canteen people found out that the worthy shopkeepers of Pretoria were not averse to turning an honest penny, and were mostly inside their shops, like spiders in their webs, waiting for business--but only, of course, through the back door. The Canteen laid in a good stock, although at famine prices, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the District Commissioner ordered the shops to be opened, so that the troops could buy what they wanted.

In the middle of each table was a big yellow pumpkin, hollowed out and filled with woodbine. In one corner of the barn, behind a pile of...", "...prince looking for ye, or me name's not Biddy Maloney.\" Dinah tried to smile, but her heart was heavy.

It was only her dancing that drew him, and he would never have another opportunity of enjoying that.

Some teasing sprite had set a waltz refrain running in her brain, and it haunted her perpetually. She went down to the vestibule with Isabel for tea, and here Scott joined them; but Sir Eustace did not put in an appearance. In their company she sought to be cheerful, and in a measure succeeded; but the thought of the morrow pressed upon her.

It was thus fully five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before he took his departure, and the Count forced himself to perform every act of civility by him to the last moment. As soon as he was gone, however, the young nobleman turned quickly to his friend, saying,-- \"I thought that contemptible piece of emptiness would never depart, and of course, Louis, after what has taken place this morning, it is absolutely necessary for me to consult with some of my friends of the same creed as myself.

His evidence occupied several hours, and it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the cross-examination began. Nothing within the reach of a crafty lawyer was left undone. All that practised skill and penetration could accomplish was exhibited, but the testimony was unshaken in every important point; and save when pushing the witness as to his own early life and habits, not a single admission could be extorted to his discredit.

At any rate he did not go where she had bade him go; completely he absented himself therefrom. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the following day before Mrs. F.

We will improve upon King Josiah.\" My brain was a medley of Scripture precedents, and I was determined that no safeguard should be wanting. We yoked the oxen again and drove the ploughs over the site of the grove. It was rough ploughing, for the place was thick with bits of stone from the tower, but the slow Afrikaner oxen plodded on, and sometime <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the work was finished. Then I sent down to the farm for bags of rock-salt, such as they use for cattle. Jobson and I took a sack apiece, and walked up and down the furrows, sowing them with salt. The last act was to set fire to the pile of tree trunks. They burned well, and on the top we flung the bodies of the green doves. The birds of Ashtaroth had an honourable pyre. Then I dismissed the much-perplexed men, and gravely shook hands with Jobson. Black with...", "...and you can't even do that.\" He threw his shoulder into a heavy blow that reached the dam watcher's face, and followed it immediately by another. Then Shearer caught his arm, motioning the dazed and bloody victim of the attack to get out of sight. Thorpe shook his foreman off with one impatient motion, and strode away up the river, his head erect, his eyes flashing, his nostrils distended. \"I reckon you'd better mosey,\" Shearer dryly advised the dam watcher; and followed. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the two men reached Dam Three, or rather the spot on which Dam Three had stood. The same spectacle repeated itself here, except that Ellis, the dam watcher, was nowhere to be seen. \"The dirty whelps,\" cried Thorpe, \"they did a good job!\" He thrashed about here and there, and so came across Ellis blindfolded and tied. When released, the dam watcher was unable to give any account of his assailants. \"They came up behind me while I was cooking,\" he said. \"One of 'em...", "...of a strike meeting, which was being held on the Green. It was like the croaking of a frog-pond, with now and then a strident voice (the bricklayer's) crying \"Buckle your belts tighter, and starve rather than give in, boys.\" Still later I heard the procession going away, singing with a slashing sound that was like driving wind and pelting rain: \"_The land, the land, the blessed, blessed land, Gawd gave the land to the people_.\" But nothing awakened baby, and towards three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> (the idea that she was really ill having taken complete possession of me) I asked where I could find the nearest doctor, and being told, I went off in search of him. The doctor was on his rounds, so I left a written message indicating baby's symptoms and begging him to come to her immediately. On the way back I passed a number of children's funerals--easily recognisable by the combined coach and hearse, the white linen \"weepers\" worn by the coachman and his...", "...his fears were not realised. He retained his sight and other faculties unimpaired until his death. On the 26th of December, 1872, he, in accordance with his annual Christmas custom, assembled all his family to dinner, at his house in Westbourne Road, and in his kindly, affectionate manner spoke hopefully of meeting them there on the same day of the following year. It was not to be. On the next day he felt somewhat unwell; in two or three days bronchitis and pleurisy supervened; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of Friday, the 5th of January, 1873, his long, honourable, and useful life terminated. [Illustration] HENRY VAN WART, J.P. Many years ago I was one of a small dinner party of gentlemen at a house in the Hagley Road. I was a comparative stranger, for I only knew the host and two others who were there. I was a young man, and all the other guests were men of middle age. The party had been invited for the purpose of introducing me to \"a few old friends,\"...", "...rapidly.... On the 9th May the bank rate was raised to 9 per cent. On the 10th May the failure of Overend, Gurney, and Company--for upwards of ten millions--was announced, and the bank rate went to 10 per cent. This failure was not made known till after business hours, so it was not till Friday, the 11th May, 1866--known as \"Black Friday\"--that the crisis reached its height. The stoppage of this large house affected the whole world, and general failure seemed imminent, when, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day on which the failure became known, it was announced that the Bank Act was again suspended, and calm began to take the place of mania. But though the panic was allayed, many failures shortly took place, which delayed the quick restoration of a sense of security.... From the above brief records of the financial tragedies of the past, we see that on each occasion reckless speculation and overtrading had been allowed to reach a dangerous height before any...", "...get it, Nance.

His wife laughed sympathetically as the staggering words stopped, and deep and regular breathing took their place.

And now the house was cold and dead, and strange little boys, in sandals and sturdy galatea, were shouting in the stable. Perhaps she was drowsy herself; she started awake, and touched Bert. An old man and a young man had...", "...What you've seen, and what I've been telling you, is bad enough, God knows; but it will be worse before it is better.

Ford and his companion reached Copah <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the third day out from Saint's Rest, and, singularly enough, the mine owners who were disputing the extension right-of-way were found amenable to reason. What Kenneth did to secure the P.

The next morning the Emperor and Empress paid a farewell visit on board the yacht, which sailed at last under \"heavy salutes.\" At five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the beach at Osborne was reached.

The power of the Lord was so strong, that it struck a mighty dread amongst the people. The mayor came and spoke a few words to me; but none of them had any power to meddle with me. So I passed away out of the town, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> went to another steeple-house about two miles off.

At certain times of the day there were signs at home on the farm that told him the time, and the cattle gave him other hours by their habits.

At eleven the last of them were upon their legs again. It was the same <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> between three and five. Midday was easy to determine when the sun was shining. Pelle could always feel it when it turned in its path. And there were a hundred other things in nature that gave him a connection with the times of day, such as the habits of the birds, and something about the fir-trees, and much besides that he could not lay his finger upon and say it was there, because it was only a feeling.

Many of the most estimable people believed the sun went round the earth, from the indisputable fact that in the morning it was on one side of the house and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> was on the other side.

Twice she looked around as though to interrupt his preoccupation,...", "...sanction. \"You seem to have decided that you owe allegiance to your country above all other interests.

I was joyfully surprised by the presence of several of my relations and friends, who wished to say farewell once more. The parting was certainly most bitter, for the thought involuntarily obtruded itself, \"Should we ever meet again in this world?\" Our mournful meditations were in some degree disturbed by a loud dispute on board the vessel. At the request of a gentleman...", "...or headland C.\" [Illustration: _Fig. 6. The Second Limb._] \"I make it out to be just 1897.5,\" was Harry's conclusion. The boys, together with John and a half dozen of the natives, went along the shore, and mounted the point C, and from that place selected another point in a southerly direction, and again made the same calculations. The vessel in the meantime was put under sail and anchored a mile below, giving the surveying party time to make several triangulations, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the party came on board, tired and ready to take a rest. From the position taken up by the ship they could see a long stretch of shore line, practically straight, trending toward the southeast, and with their glass could see, miles away, a headland which afforded a pronounced point for observation. The next morning the same parties rowed to the shore, and Uraso was left with the party to guard the shore boat, while Muro accompanied John and the boys. On this...", "...used to such sights. That wooden box, with its mouthlike slit was like an insatiable monster that was constantly fed, yet was still gaping for more. Having done the deed Juliette turned, and as rapidly as she had come, so she went back to her temporary home. A home no more now; she must leave it at once, to-day if possible. This much she knew, that she no longer could touch the bread of the man she had betrayed. She would not appear at breakfast, she could plead a headache, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Petronelle should pack her things. She turned into a little shop close by, and asked for a glass of milk and a bit of bread. The woman who served her eyed her with some curiosity, for Juliette just now looked almost out of her mind. She had not yet begun to think, and she had ceased to suffer. Both would come presently, and with them the memory of this last irretrievable hour and a just estimate of what she had done. CHAPTER XI \"Vengeance is...", "...behind the henhouse that next morning, Captain,\" she said. \"So I did. And I thought 'twas one of Solon Taylor's boys. I'll bet 'twas Kenelm; he'd sneaked over to get the umbrella. It was him that said, 'Oh, Lord' that night; I'll bet high on it. When he thought of what Hannah'd say to his smashin' the umbrella she gave him it's a wonder he didn't say more than that. That's the answer--the whole answer--and I'll prove it next time I see Kenelm.\" Which, by the way, he did. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> John and Emily walked up to the village together. They asked Thankful and Captain Obed to accompany them, but the invitation was declined. However, as John had suddenly remembered that he had left his office door unlocked, he felt that he should go and Emily went with him. \"I presume likely,\" observed the captain, as he looked after them, \"that I ought to feel conscience-struck for not sayin' yes when they asked me to come along, but somehow I don't. I have a...", "...on her arms on the back of her chair. Bob darted across from the doorway and laid an awkwardly sympathetic young hand on the flaxen masses of his sister's hair. \"It's a shame!\" he said, warmly. \"I wish I could stay and help you. But I tell you what I'll do. I'll be up the minute I get out of the office. Leave the heavy things for me to do. And don't try to house-clean the whole flat just because of Mrs. Dorothy Chase. She isn't worth it.\" He was as good as his word. Five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> saw him at home again, helping Sally in every way he could think of. Bob was good help, and she had seldom needed him more than to-day. She went about with flushed cheeks, moving languidly, yet keeping steadily at work with the determination of the young hostess who sees nothing else to do. She had spent the afternoon in the kitchen; she spent the evening in all those little final tasks which seem so small and yet in the aggregate do weigh heavily, upon the eve of...", "...lane turning. \"It's very good of you, sir,\" he answered, \"but I'd rather they didn't know my whereabouts. If I live through this, and return to England, I shall still be a private soldier. I'm much obliged to you, sir, all the same.\" He saluted again, and walked away. Valentine looked after the retreating figure with a queer, sad smile upon his face. \"You're a difficult fish to deal with,\" he muttered; \"but we shall land you again some day, though I hardly know how.\" Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the column was once more in motion, and then commenced an experience which Jack, and all those who shared in it, have probably never forgotten. At first the march was orderly, but, as the hours went by, progress became more and more difficult. Camels, half-starved and exhausted, lagged and fell, causing continual delay and confusion. The desert track having been abandoned in order to avoid possible collision with the enemy, the road lay at one time through a jungle...", "...routed by the Southerners, who put them all to flight, captured three guns and took the Robinson house. Fortune, nevertheless, still seemed to favor the North. The Southerners had barely held their positions around the Henry house. Most of their cannon were dismounted. Hundreds had dropped from exhaustion. Some had died from heat and excessive exertion. The mortality among the officers was frightful. There were few hopeful hearts in the Southern army. It was now three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and Beauregard, through his glasses, saw a great column of dust rising above the tops of the trees. His experience told him that it must be made by marching troops, but what troops were they, Northern or Southern? In an agony of suspense he appealed to the generals around him, but they could tell nothing. He sent off aides at a gallop to see, but meanwhile he and his generals could only wait, while the column of dust grew broader and broader and higher and higher....", "...before four or five. It was some distance from Rochford Park to Emmerton; and she was sure there must be a great deal to do before they set off, and, in consequence, she had calculated upon seeing very little of either Mr or Miss Cunningham on that day. Her dismay, therefore, was extreme, as she watched from the gallery window, and saw the carriage slowly driving down the avenue. She was not, however, required to entertain them, for it was her duty to attend upon her mamma; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> there was an engagement to walk with Miss Morton and Rose to Stephen's cottage, to inquire how he was getting on after his attack of gout, and carry him a new flannel-waistcoat, which Rose had taken great delight in helping to make. There was, therefore, no fear, she thought, of seeing much of Miss Cunningham, except at dinner- time; and as for her brother, he would probably not come in the way at all. And having thus relieved her mind, Amy returned to her mamma's...", "...watched them from her rocking-chair on the porch. What her thoughts were regarding her nephew and the girl it would be hard to guess, but whatever they were, they made her face no grimmer than usual, and the light in her bespectacled eyes was scarcely one of dislike or even of disapproval. Yet there was a strange something in the woman's look or manner which suggested that she watched the visitor with thoughts or feelings which she wished neither the girl nor Tunis to observe. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the two young people started back for the Ball house, taking a roundabout way. They did not even follow the patrol path, well defined along the brink of Wreckers' Head as far as the beach. Instead, they went down by the wagon track to the beach itself, intending to follow the edge of the sea and the channel around to a path that led up the face of the bluff to the Ball homestead. It was a walk the girl had never taken. The reaction she experienced after having...", "...to the rear and be ready for heavy work, for the Duke of Burgundy lay behind Clairoix with a reserve. Flavy's lieutenant, with archers and the artillery of the boulevard, was to keep the English troops from coming up from below and seizing the causeway and cutting off Joan's retreat in case she should have to make one. Also, a fleet of covered boats was to be stationed near the boulevard as an additional help in case a retreat should become necessary. It was the 24th of May. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Joan moved out at the head of six hundred cavalry--on her last march in this life! It breaks my heart. I had got myself helped up onto the walls, and from there I saw much that happened, the rest was told me long afterward by our two knights and other eye-witnesses. Joan crossed the bridge, and soon left the boulevard behind her and went skimming away over the raised road with her horsemen clattering at her heels. She had on a brilliant silver-gilt cape over her...", "...end of July, coming out to find the place unoccupied as yet by other visitors, stood there a while with an air of happy possession. She moved from end to end of the terrace, pausing, gazing about her, taking in with a face that showed the pleasure of a brief independence the combination of delightful things--of old rooms with old decorations that gleamed and gloomed through the high windows, of old gardens that squared themselves in the wide angles of old walls, of wood-walks rustling <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> breeze and stretching away to further reaches of solitude and summer. The scene had an expectant stillness that she was too charmed to desire to break; she watched it, listened to it, followed with her eyes the white butterflies among the flowers below her, then gave a start as the cry of a peacock came to her from an unseen alley. It set her after a minute into less difficult motion; she passed slowly down the steps, wandering further, looking back at the big bright...", "...our services were not interrupted, nor did I hear anything of it until I had parted with her at her home and gone to the house of a relative, Dr. Randolph Page's, to dine. There I learned that a fierce battle had been fought at Five Forks, on the extreme right of our line, in which the Federals had gotten possession of the railroads by which our army was supplied with food. This, of course, necessitated the abandonment of both Richmond and Petersburg. As I passed along the streets <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> there was nothing to indicate a panicky feeling; in fact, there was rather less commotion than usual, but much, no doubt, within doors. On arriving at camp I was the first to bring tidings of what had occurred to the company, and observed the varying effect produced on the different members, officers and men. To some it came as relief after long suspense, while others seemed hopelessly cast down and dejected. Orders to prepare to move soon followed, and our march to...", "...Inventors--Celebrities in Salisbury--A Visit to the Hospital--Cecil Rhodes in Council--A Run with the Hounds, with a Check at the Telegraph Line--A Countess saves her Sewing-Machine and kills a Lion--Marshal MacMahon's Aide-de-Camp as a Trooper in Mashonaland--The Delays incident to being at the End of a Wire--The Rains begin--The Situation in Mashonaland. _13th November._--Up early. Paid off and sorrowfully said \"Good-bye\" to Diamond and Umtini, my two nigger servants. And <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the General moved on from Enkeldoorn towards Salisbury. The party consisted of Sir Frederick, Vyvyan, Ferguson, Gormley (our principal medical officer), Leech (who manages our transport), three waggons, a Cape cart, and lots of riding-horses, servants, office-clerks, etc. [Illustration: \"DIAMOND\" My Zulu servant. Well-named \"Diamond,\" for he was a jewel of a servant.] This night we camped at Adlum's Farm (the green mamba house, where I had \"dined\" the night...", "...and the horses plunged and lunged all day through the mud, over logs, stones, and roots. Our nerves quivered with the torture of piloting our mistrusted desperate horses through these awful pitfalls. We were still in the region of ferns and devil's-club. We allowed no feed to escape us. At any hour of the day, whenever we found a bunch of grass, no matter if it were not bigger than a broom, we stopped for the horses to graze it and so we kept them on their feet. At five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we climbed to a low, marshy lake where an Indian hunter was camped. He said we would find feed on another lake some miles up, and we pushed on, wallowing through mud and water of innumerable streams, each moment in danger of leaving a horse behind. I walked nearly all day, for it was torture to me as well as to Ladrone to ride him over such a trail. Three of our horses now showed signs of poisoning, two of them walked with a sprawling action of the fore legs, their...", "...castle of Schwerin, on the Mecklenburg coast.

Turenne commanded the left, which consisted of his own army, with twelve squadrons of Weimar's cavalry, with the Hessian army--six battalions and six squadrons--as a second line. The centre, consisting of ten battalions and five squadrons of horse, was commanded by Count de Marsin. Enghien took no special command, preferring to remain free to go where his presence was most needed. CHAPTER XVIII: NORDLINGEN It was five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when all the arrangements for the attack were completed. But as on the 3rd of August the evening is long, it was judged that there would be sufficient daylight to carry out the battle. The French began with a cannonade against the village, and this was replied to by the guns on the two hills. Not only did the position of the latter give them great superiority, but much time was lost by the French in being obliged to move forward their guns as the army advanced, a slow...", "...telling me that it was sacrificing his safety as well as those of the others who were able to move, for that if we did not find water ere night the whole party would die. He was indeed as weak from want of food as any of us, for we had made such rapid and lengthy marches in the hope of speedily forwarding assistance to those left behind that when we came at night to the conclusion of our day's journey Kaiber was too much exhausted to think of looking for food. About two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the men were so completely exhausted that it was impossible to induce them to move, and at this period I found that we had only made about eight miles in a south by east direction, over plains studded with small sandy hills and the beds of dried up tea-tree swamps. When I halted the sun was intensely powerful; the groans and exclamations of some of the men were painful in the extreme; but my feelings were still more agonized when I saw the poor creatures driven, by...", "...I care not to name, and when he was in liquor he told me all. He convicted himself out of his own mouth.\" \"Where is McGinnis?\" Shadow turned away. He pretended not to have heard my question, and I did not press it. Together we five had supped, and a right merry party it was--although I thought that the merriment of Nellie Millbank was rather forced. This I thought might be because of a natural embarrassment at being in men's clothing after having revealed her true sex. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I had heard of the discovery of a dead body on an East River pier. The man was handcuffed and gagged, and had been repeatedly stabbed. Already it was becoming spoken of as the most brutal murder on record. That evening I was sent to look at the body and to give any assistance I could toward working up the case. The moment I reached the Morgue and the sheet was drawn down, I understood the reason why Shadow had pretended not to hear my question. The body was that...", "...CHAPTER XXII IN MAYA LAND (1901) We had planned to go from Tampico to Chiapas, and from there to Yucatan, where we were to finish our work for the season. We found, however, that there was no certainty in regard to a boat for Coatzacoalcos, while the Benito Juarez was about to sail for Progreso the next day. Not to lose time, we decided to do our Yucatan work first, and to let Chiapas wait until later. We were busy that day making arrangements for departure, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> hired a canoe to take our stuff from the wharf to the boat, which was standing out in the river, beyond Dona Cecilia. There was a brisk wind against us, and we almost arrived too late to have our luggage taken aboard. The next morning, we took the first train to Dona Cecilia, and were on board the boat at nine o'clock. We had been told that the sailing would take place at ten, but, on arrival, found that they were waiting for cattle which were being brought across...", "...and outside. He circled the house, but neither saw nor heard anything, and so he went in again. But when he turned in, having extinguished the light, he laid the gun on the floor beside the bed, and in the morning smuggled it out without Faith's knowledge. Before she had risen he examined the ground around the house, but found no footprints other than their own. And so he came to the conclusion that whatever he had heard had not been a footstep. He pottered around all morning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> decided to ride in to town and see Judge Riley. The latter might have some news. \"Well, I won't go,\" Faith decided. \"I have bread to bake, and it's too far, anyway. I'll have supper ready when you get back.\" But when Angus reached the judge's office it was closed. In the post office he found a note from him, consisting of four words: \"Want to see you,\" and upon inquiry he learned that the lawyer had driven out with Dr. Wilkes to see a rancher named McLatchie who...", "...take it up.

It was not later than three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> but I saw at least a dozen wonderful big moths, dusky and luring, fluttering eagerly over the wild roses covering a south window of the Deacon's room adjoining mine on the west. Instantly I knew what that meant. I hurried to the room and found a female Promothea at the top of the screen covering a window that the caretaker had slightly lowered. I caught up a net and ran to bring a step-ladder. The back foundation is several feet high and that threw the tops of the...", "...for Hancock to cross over--although it would bring him to the same side of the stream with the rest of the army--would still farther isolate him from it. The stream would have to be crossed twice in the face of the enemy to unite with the main body. The idea of crossing was therefore abandoned. Lee had weakened the other parts of his line to meet this movement of Hancock's, and I determined to take advantage of it. Accordingly in the morning, orders were issued for an attack <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> on the centre by Warren's and Wright's corps, Hancock to command all the attacking force. Two of his divisions were brought to the north side of the Po. Gibbon was placed to the right of Warren, and Birney in his rear as a reserve. Barlow's division was left south of the stream, and Mott of the same corps was still to the left of Wright's corps. Burnside was ordered to reconnoitre his front in force, and, if an opportunity presented, to attack with vigor. The enemy...", "...the young observer answered, and nursing his broken arm with his other hand, he began: \"We first heard about the hurricane on the morning of August 10th, where it had been seen between the islands of Barbados and Dominica. A little before ten o'clock that morning, storm warnings were sent to all West Indian stations. It came as a good deal of a surprise to us at Galveston because there had been none of the signs which usually go before a bad tropical disturbance. At two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of that day, notice of the approach of a storm was sent to all Atlantic and Gulf stations of the Weather Bureau and the report was sent out by the wireless naval station at Arlington, Virginia. \"On the morning of the eleventh, the storm was south of the island of St. Croix, with a hurricane strength wind of sixty miles an hour at Porto Rico. On the twelfth, it was central off Haiti, and by the next morning was ravaging Jamaica. Hurricane warnings were sent out by...", "...chemicals. When they received these, and with a supply of lampblack, they were ready, waiting only for the fall of darkness. The lampblack was to be put on their hands and faces so that their whiteness would not be revealed in case the Germans played their searchlights on the ground the boys hoped to cover, or sent up star clusters to give light for raiding parties sent out to kill the French and American wounded, such being one of the pleasant ways in which Fritz makes war.

The next day, 18th, he continued the same occupation and arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at the junction of Medicine and Missouri rivers: up the latter he ascended, and passed at the distance of a mile an island and a little timber in an eastwardly bend of the river.

In vain Persigny and Orsi, who in the prince's absence considered themselves to be in command, assured him that to land was impossible; Parquin would not recognize their authority. The rest of the story I will tell in Count Orsi's own words. He wrote his account in \"Fraser's Magazine,\" 1879:-- \"The wrath of the major was extreme. There was danger in his anger.

It was about 2 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that the first trio, consisting of Pitts, Bob Younger and, it is believed, one of the James brothers, came over the bridge, and crossing the Square from northwest to southeast, dismounted in front of the bank, throwing their bridle reins over some hitching posts beside the street.

During the Centennial Exposition of 1876 at Philadelphia, I had been appointed upon the educational jury, and, as the main part of the work came during the university long vacation, had devoted myself to it, and had thus been brought into relations with some very interesting men. Of these may be named, at the outset, the Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil. I first saw him in a somewhat curious way. He had landed at New York in the morning, and early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he appeared with the Empress and their gentlemen and ladies in waiting at Booth's Theater. The attraction was Shakspere's ``Henry V,'' and no sooner was he seated in his box than he had his Shakspere open before him. Being in an orchestra stall, I naturally observed him from time to time, and at one passage light was thrown upon his idea of his duties as a monarch. The play was given finely, by the best American company of recent years, and he was deeply absorbed...", "...capable of sheltering snipers.

Both sides strove all day without gaining ground. Divisional headquarters were only a short distance behind the 6th, and the 8th Brigade was moved up into the same area to be ready to assist.

Rain fell copiously and the wind was chilly. After a miserable night in bivouac, the 6th Brigade was astir before daylight on the 21st. They were fighting at dawn, and in the half light compelled the enemy to retire to within half a mile of Beitunia.

In this bay there is good anchorage; but what refreshments it may afford I know not; we caught no fish, though we were at anchor, but probably there is fresh water in several places, as both the islands and the main are inhabited. We saw smoke and fires upon the main, and upon the islands we saw people. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we passed Cape Manifold, from which the land trends N.N.W. The land of the Cape is high, rising in hills directly from the sea, and may be known by three islands which lie off it, one of them near the shore, and the other two eight miles out at sea. One of these islands is low and flat, and the other high and round.

The various secretions are thus stimulated, the nerve force aroused, no matter how the duties of the preceding day and night may have drawn upon the system. Another cup at four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> is sufficient to sustain the energies for many hours.\" It is only fair to add, however, that the JOURNAL went on to remark that in this way some 50 grains of caffeine would be taken each week, and that very little more might develop injurious symptoms, so that the power of doing an illimitable amount of work would be obtained under somewhat risky conditions. One of its most remarkable effects is that of relieving the feeling of fatigue or exhaustion, whether this be...", "...my little son as a messenger to the Gros Ventres. Accompanied by the interpreter, Legare, he made that Gros Ventre camp before dark, a distance of seventy-five miles, and gave his message the same evening to the chiefs, and without changing horses they were in the saddle early in the morning, and reached my camp at half past three o'clock.

The back of the inn looked into an orchard, and through an open door opposite to the porch Edward Arundel saw the low branches of the trees, and the ripening fruit red and golden <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sunlight. He went out into this orchard to read his letters, his mind a little disturbed by the strange handwriting upon the Dangerfield epistle. The letter was from his father's housekeeper, imploring him most earnestly to go down to the Park without delay. Squire Arundel had been stricken with paralysis, and was declared to be in imminent danger. Mrs. and Miss Arundel and Mr. Reginald were away in Germany. The faithful old servant implored the younger son to lose...", "...wine More bounteous far than all the frantic juice Which Bacchus pours,\" was produced, although the drought and scarcity of June rain had dried the palms. Before I outstretched myself, the fairer half of the population sent a message to say that they had never seen a white man: what less could be done than to distribute a few beads and pat the children, who screamed like sucking pigs and \"squirmed\" like young monkeys? The Chrononhotonthologus of a king came <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with a tail of a hundred vertebrae: he was a milder specimen than usual; he had neither Mambrino's helmet nor beadle's cloak, and perhaps his bashfulness in the presence of strangers arose from a consciousness that his head-gear and robes were not in keeping with his station. But he did not fail to grumble at his \"dash;\" indeed, he must be more than African who shall say, \"Hold! enough.\" He vouchsafed a small return in fowls and \"beneficent manioc,\" and sent with us...", "...a philosopher, little mother,\" Roland laughed. \"At any rate, as I said, things are better than I expected. Of course it is no good doing anything for the next day or two;\" and a shade passed over Roland's face as he thought how widely his Christmas day would differ from his anticipations of it; \"but next week I will go round and see if I can get something to do. I am not particular what it is, as long as it enables me to stay at Brownsville.\" CHAPTER II TRUE FRIENDS Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Roland went out to get a few things that were required. Suddenly he came on a group of half a dozen girls who had just finished putting up the decorations in the school-room. The first couple passed him with a bow, but Cissie White, who was walking next, stopped with her companion and shook hands with him. \"How are you, Roland? We have missed you at decorations this afternoon.\" \"I was sorry not to be able to come, Cissie,\" Roland said, \"and I am sorry I shall not...", "...in the neighbourhood of one hundred and twenty-five pounds, and he had a fine set of tusks. He was rather vicious-looking and was doing considerable kicking before he gave up the ghost. It was impossible for me to carry him through the bush owing to the fact that I had the valuable camera and apparatus to take care of, so I made a mental note of the spot, and cut his ears off. It took four hours' search to find the camera, in spite of my belief that I had not gone far, and it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when I arrived at headquarters. The very next morning there was a good opportunity to see the smoking of rubber-milk. A _seringueiro_ had collected his product and when I went to the smoking-hut I found him busy turning over and over a big stick, resting on two horizontal guides, built on both sides of a funnel from which a dense smoke was issuing. On the middle of the stick was a huge ball of rubber. Over this he kept pouring the milk from a tin-basin. Gradually the...", "...dignity when she chose. I did not finish my sentence, though I must have looked the inquiry I thought better not to put into words. \"Mr. Trohm is a man of blameless reputation,\" she avowed. \"If he has allowed himself to cherish suspicions in our regard, he has doubtless had his reasons for it.\" And with these quiet words she left me to my thoughts, and I must say to my doubts, which were all the more painful that I saw no immediate opportunity for clearing them up. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> William burst in with news from the other end of the lane. \"Such a lark!\" he cried. \"The investigation at Deacon Spear's house was a mere farce, and I just made them repeat it with a few frills. They had dug up my cellar, and I was determined they should dig up his. Oh, the fun it was! The old fellow kicked, but I had my way. They couldn't refuse me, you know; I hadn't refused them. So that man's cellar-bottom has had a stir up. They didn't find anything, but it did...", "...in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine, New York and Pennsylvania. The estimates of loss for northern Michigan alone amounted to $40,000,000. For two weeks the loss was set at $1,000,000 a day. The two towns of Hibbing and Chisholm were practically wiped out of existence, and 296 lives were lost. Certain forest fires have been so gigantic and terrible as to become historic. One of these is the Miramichi fire of 1825. It began its greatest destruction about one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of October 7th of that year, at a place about sixty miles above the town of Newcastle, on the Miramichi River, in New Brunswick. Before ten o'clock at night it was twenty miles below New Castle. In nine hours it had destroyed a belt of forest eighty miles long and twenty-five miles wide. Over more than two and a half million acres almost every living thing was killed. Even the fish were afterwards found dead in heaps on the river banks....", "...taking up the newspaper and throwing it down again, of doing a few stitches, then letting the work fall on her lap; and above all, of thinking, as she was forced to do, from sheer want of occupation. She listened, and nobody came. Two or three times she thought she heard steps approaching, but nobody came. She had thought of perhaps going out since the morning was so fine, walking down to the village, which was quite within her powers, and of planning several calls which might be made <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to take advantage of the fine day. But she became really fretted and annoyed as the morning crept along. Lucy was losing even her politeness, the Dowager thought. This is what comes of what people call happiness! They get so absorbed in themselves, there is no possibility of paying ordinary attention to other people. At last, after completely tiring herself out, Lady Randolph got up and put down her work altogether, throwing it away with anger. She had not lived so...", "...their designs they will have to lay their plans and wait their opportunity, and such may not come for some time. Farewell, then, Ulred, and a safe voyage to you. As for me, I have had enough of the sea, and never wish to set foot on board ship again; for what with the want of space and the tossing and the sickness, I would rather pass the time in bonds in a prison cell than be cooped up in a ship.\" A few minutes later Beorn, attended by his servants, started for the North, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Ulred, after giving many orders to his head man as to the conduct of his business during his absence, took boat, and with Ulf went on board the ship. To the armourer it was a very serious undertaking upon which he was embarking. He had never before set foot on board of a ship, and a sea-voyage in those days was regarded as a very dangerous business. Nothing short of his loyalty to Harold would have induced him to have ventured on such an expedition. It was but a few...", "...they do deceive her, then?\" \"Yes'm.

Big Bill Kyler gets it every week, and the men get what they want.\" \"Bill Kyler--um-m,\" said the lady. \"And where does he get it?\" \"Dennis O'Day, the man what owns the brewery and the wholesale house, sells to him. Big Bill drives down <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and comes home after dark.\" \"Each Saturday, you say?\" asked the woman. \"Yes'm.\" During the conversation, Elizabeth had also been emptying her lunch-box. She listened eagerly to the conversation between her companions. This Dennis O'Day was the man who was doing all in his power to demoralize Bitumen. She was interested because she knew of him, and moreover, by the feeling that these questions were asked from more than passing curiosity. \"This O'Day is about...", "...and struggle up sandbanks, tear through undercover, and finally H---- got \"stogged\" in a treacherous green marsh. Was there ever anything so exasperating and ridiculous? After running more or less for three-quarters of an hour in a sweltering heat, we came upon the horses in an open glade in the wood, where they were calmly regaling in green pastures, like lotus-eaters themselves. Never from that day forward have I forgotten the necessary duty of picketing my horse. It was well on <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before we got to Dognacska, a mere mining village, but prettily situated in a narrow valley. On approaching, we found it to be a more uncivilised place than we had expected, and we had not expected much. The children ran away screaming at the sight of two horsemen, so travellers, I expect, are unknown in these parts. We found out a little inn, indicated by a wisp of straw hanging above the door, and here we asked to be accommodated; they were profuse in promises, but...", "...it is dark we will man our oars and row to the southwest. We shall be far away before morning, even if they look further for us, which they are hardly likely to do.\" \"How about the prisoners, captain?\" \"We have no choice but to take them with us, Messer Francisco. I am sure I do not want to be bothered with them, but we cannot land them before we leave, or they would carry the news to Girgenti in an hour, and we should be caught the first thing in the morning.\" It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before the galley was seen returning, rowing slowly and heavily. \"I expect,\" the captain said, \"they kept up the racing pace at which they started for some four hours. By that time they must have been completely worn out, and no doubt they anchored and waited for some hours for the men to feed and rest themselves, for from the hurry with which they started you may be sure that they did not wait to break their fast. \"I would give a month's pay to be in that harbour...", "..._rest_ in this sad situation. I therefore now determined to set off for Lisbon, in hopes that I might obtain from the chaplain, who was stationed there, some slight alleviation of my misery, for none but Roman Catholic priests were to be found where I then was. I accordingly set off, accompanied by my servant, but in such a hurry, and so utterly regardless of all worldly concerns, that I left my baggage in my quarters, which was taken care of by the friend before mentioned. I started <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the second day after my attack. The sun was scorching hot above my head, but I regarded it not, seeing there was a hotter fire within me; indeed I believed I could not mortify my flesh sufficiently, so blind was I at this time of the nature of atonement. My feeling was, that I had an Almighty enemy over me; that His eye was upon me for evil, let me go where I would; and that I could not possibly escape from the destruction which He would shortly inflict upon my...", "...river with a lot of casks aboard, that ship is after palm-oil--at least, so her skipper will tell ye.

But, you mark me, that brig's here to take off a cargo of blacks; and unless I'm greatly mistaken she'll have vanished when we turn up here again to-morrow.\" It was just six bells <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> watch when two boats--one containing fresh water in casks, and the other loaded to her gunwale with fresh meat--mostly goat-mutton strongly impregnated with the powerful musky odour of the animal--appeared paddling leisurely off to the _Barracouta_ under the guidance of four powerful but phenomenally lazy Krumen, who would probably have consumed the best part of half-an-hour in the short passage from the wharf to the brig had not our impatient first luff dispatched a...", "...flee the field, thoughtlessly leaving bag and baggage to the tender mercies of a ruthless invader. Among their effects I find some bread and a cucumber, which I forthwith confiscate, leaving a two and a half piastre metallique piece in its stead; the affrighted women are watching me from the safe distance of three hundred yards; when they return and discover the coin they will wish some 'cycler would happen along and frighten them away on similar conditions every day. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I find myself wandering along the wrong trail; not a very unnatural occurrence hereabout, for since leaving the valley of the Gevmeili Chai, it has been difficult to distinguish the Erzingan trail from the numerous other trails intersecting the country in every direction. On such a journey as this one seems to acquire a certain amount of instinct concerning roads; certain it is, that I never traverse a wrong trail any distance these days ere, without any tangible...", "...of the Koran with him. What he saw when he looked out of the windows was not reassuring. The building stood at one side of a closed yard of small size but with very high walls. It was quite certain that there was no means of exit except through the house. Even could he cross these walls he knew from his recollection of what he had seen from the roof that his position would be no better. The trapped feeling overcame him again, and he threw himself on the floor in despair. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he heard the door below opened softly, and just afterwards the girl ascended through the trap-door. She brought some food,--a few hard-boiled eggs, a dish of meat cooked after the Malay fashion in a paste, and some dates. Brands first question was as to the practicability of his escaping, but the girl strongly negatived the idea of any attempt in that direction being made for the present. The house was, she said, so arranged that until some occasion arose upon which...", "...easier now not to wish to escape from everybody. The first week went by in such a perfection of delight as Guy had scarcely thought was possible. Indeed it remained ultimately unimaginable, this dream life on the Naiad. A pleasant woman in a sunbonnet came to cook breakfast and dinner; and Pauline and Margaret went to Ladingford and bought sunbonnets, a pink one for Pauline and for Margaret one of watchet blue. In the fresh mornings Guy and the sisters wandered idly over the meads; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Margaret generally read a book in the shade while Guy and Pauline went for walks, walks that ended always in sitting by the river's edge and telling each other the tale of their love. The nights with a clear moon waxing to the full were entrancing. There was a small piano on the barge, the notes of which had been brought by damp almost to the timbre of an exhausted spinet. It served however for Mrs. Grey to accompany Pauline while she played on a violin simple tunes....", "...Foligno Madonna, Communion of St. Jerome, and of course the Marriage of St. Catherine, and really my copy by the young German is good as I see the original again.

I think for the moment yellow-books and interpellations and the \"peuple souverain\" generally as represented in the Chambre des Deputes are out of his head. The sun came out bright and warm <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and we drove to the Villa Pamphili. We stopped at San Pietro in Montorio on our way. It is there that St. Peter is said to have been crucified. The view from the terrace is very fine--the whole of Rome at our feet stretching out over the Campagna to the Alban Hills. It was too early really for the view, as one ought to see it at sunset, when the hills take most beautiful rose blue tints and the Campagna looks vague and mysterious, not the long barren stretch of waste...", "...King, but would not be the murderers of their fellow-citizens. They called themselves the soldiers of the nation, and left now no doubt on which side they would be, in case of a rupture. Similar accounts came in from the troops in other parts of the kingdom, giving good reason to believe they would side with their fathers and brothers, rather than with their officers. The operation of this medicine at Versailles, was as sudden as it was powerful. The alarm there was so complete, that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 27th, the King wrote with his own hand letters to the Presidents of the Clergy and Nobles, engaging them immediately to join the _Tiers_. These two bodies were debating, and hesitating, when notes from the Count d'Artois decided their compliance. They went in a body, and took their seats with the Tiers, and thus rendered the union of the orders in one chamber complete. The Assembly now entered on the business of their mission, and first proceeded to arrange...", "...Then, \"Button your coat and run along.\" \"I haven't thanked you,\" exclaimed Lydia, \"I can't thank you. Oh, but thank you, Mr. Marshall--I--I--\" she began to tremble violently. \"Stop!\" roared Marshall. \"And you tell your father to look out for your nerves. Now skip.\" And Lydia's trembling stopped and she skipped. She did not tell Lizzie of her errand and that faithful soul was too glad to see her eat her dinner to think to ask her why she had skated so long. Kent came out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and the two fished through the ice until sunset, when they came in with a string of fish sufficiently long to divide and make a meal for the Dudleys and the Moultons. At dusk, Kent departed with his fish and \"Men of Iron,\" loaned by Lydia as a special favor, under his arm. Old Lizzie cleaned the fish and Lydia fried them, with the daintiness and skill that seemed to have been born in her. She laid an envelope at her father's plate and when he sat down, silent and...", "...a buoyant rhythm that more, perhaps, than merited success, or valorous conduct, smoothes out the creases in a man's soul. And so quick is a man to recover from his own baseness, and to ape outwardly his transient inner feelings, that I found myself presently, walking with a high head and a mind full of martial thoughts. All that day, except for a short halt at noon, we followed the river across the great natural park; now paralleling its convolutions, and now cutting diagonals. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we came to the end of the park land. A more or less precipitous formation of glistening quartz marked its boundary, and into a fissure of this the stream, now a small river, plunged with accelerated speed. The going became difficult. The walls of the fissure through which the river rushed were smooth and water-worn, impossible to ascend; and between the brink of the river and the base of the walls were congestions of boulders, jammed drift-wood, and tangled alder...", "...uncompromising red flannel. But to Nan, as the bony arms went round her and the Scottish voice, harsh no longer but tender as an old song, murmured in her ears, she seemed the embodiment of beautiful, consoling motherhood, and her flat chest a resting-place where weary heads might gladly lie and sorrowful hearts pour out their grief in tears. \"Dinna greet, ma bairnie,\" crooned Eliza. \"Ma wee bairnie, greet nae mair.\" CHAPTER XXXIV THE WHITE FLAME It was not till late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day following upon her flight from Mallow that Nan and Peter met again. He had, so Sandy informed her, walked over to the Court in order to see Kitty. \"I think he has some private affair of his own that he wants to talk over with her,\" explained Sandy. \"It's about his wife, I expect,\" answered Nan dully. \"She's had sunstroke--and is ordered home from India.\" \"Poor devil!\" The words rushed from Sandy's lips. \"How rotten everything is!\" he added...", "...was, that it was not witnessed by Berrendale. It never for a moment entered into the ingenuous mind of Adeline, that her declaration would have more weight than that of Mary Warner; and that she might, with almost a certainty of being believed, deny her charge entirely: on the contrary, she had no doubt but that Mrs Beauclerc was coming to inquire into the grounds for Mary's gross address; and she was resolved to confess to her all the circumstances of her story. After church <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Mrs Beauclerc arrived, and Adeline observed, with pleasure, that her manner was even kinder than usual; it was such as to ensure the innocent of the most strenuous support, and to invite the guilty to confidence and penitence.

But it was in vain to expect anything favourable to humanity from people who are strangers to its dictates. So having shaken hands with this unfortunate boy, and blended my tears with his, assuring him, however, that I would do my utmost to redeem him, I saw him led off by three of Ali's slaves towards the camp at Bubaker. When the Moors had mounted their horses, I was ordered to follow them; and, after a toilsome journey through the woods, in a very sultry day, we arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at a walled village, called Doombani; where we remained two days, waiting for the arrival of some horsemen from the northward. On the 1st of June we departed from Doombani towards Jarra. Our company now amounted to two hundred men, all on horseback; for the Moors never use infantry in their wars. They appeared capable of enduring great fatigue; but from their total want of discipline our journey to Jarra was more like a fox-chase than the march of an army. At...", "...and in order. The flowers were like new acquaintances; she approached them in a familiar spirit, and made herself at home among them. The garden walks were damp, and Edna called to the maid to bring out her rubber sandals. And there she stayed, and stooped, digging around the plants, trimming, picking dead, dry leaves. The children's little dog came out, interfering, getting in her way. She scolded him, laughed at him, played with him. The garden smelled so good and looked so pretty <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sunlight. Edna plucked all the bright flowers she could find, and went into the house with them, she and the little dog. Even the kitchen assumed a sudden interesting character which she had never before perceived. She went in to give directions to the cook, to say that the butcher would have to bring much less meat, that they would require only half their usual quantity of bread, of milk and groceries. She told the cook that she herself would be greatly occupied...", "...we were exhausted from the climb and the pheasant had disappeared. We learned soon that it is useless to chase a Reeves's pheasant when it has once been flushed, for it will invariably make for a mountain side, run rapidly to the top, and, once over the summit, fly to another ridge. On the way home I got my first pheasant, and an hour later put up half a dozen. I should have had two more, but instead of shooting I only stared, fascinated by the beauty of the thing I saw. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and the sun was drawing oblique paths of shimmering golden light among the trees. In a clearing near the summit of a wooded shoulder I saw six pheasants feeding and I realized that, by skirting the base of the ridge, I could slip up from behind and force them to fly across the open valley. The stalk progressed according to schedule. When I crossed the ridge there was a whir of wings and six birds shot into the air not thirty feet away. The sun, glancing on their yellow...", "...way, so wild that they wouldn't travel on the same train together. Why, gentlemen--\" \"Please pass the salt,\" interposed Griswold. The Mississippian enjoyed the sound of his own voice, which boomed out above the noise of the train with broad effects of dialect that these types will not be asked to reproduce. Griswold's eyes had again met those of the girl opposite, and there was, he felt, a look of appeal in them. The discussion distressed her, just as the telegrams from New Orleans <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> papers had distressed her, and Griswold began at once to entertain his table companions with his views on a number of national political issues, that were as vital to Arizona or Wyoming as to the Carolinas. He told stories to illustrate his points, and told them so well that his three companions forgot the estrangement of the belligerent governors. Griswold ran on in the low, musical voice that distinguishes the cultivated Virginian in any company anywhere in the...", "...good fun. I say, Bob, bring him over with you to-morrow to dinner. We halt at Carrick till the detachment comes up.\" '\"Could you call it breakfast?\" said I. \"There's a thought just strikes me: we'll be over in Carrick with you about six o'clock; well have our breakfast, whatever you like to give us, and dine with you about eleven or twelve afterwards.\" 'Oakley liked the project well; and before we parted the whole thing was arranged for the next day.

Then another and another and another. We could see the white smoke of the shells floating past behind the spring greenery of a hedgerow only a few fields away. It drifted slowly through the trees and then came another salvo. There were some red roofs near--those of a neighbouring farm--but we could not see whether they were firing at them, or at some sign of moving troops, or at a working party if there were any; and I do not know now. As we came back that way <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> there was more shelling farther along. The woman in the doorway simply turned her head in its direction for a moment, and so did a younger woman who came to the doorway behind her. Then they turned to the baby again. Through the trees one could see that the farmhouses and cottages farther on had mostly been battered and broken. There was a road running at a little distance, and every roof and wall in it had been shattered. There was a feverish, insane disorder about...", "...\"I will meet you by the train you mention, and the affair shall have my best attention.\" \"Thank you,\" he said, rising. He shook hands with me and took his leave. The next day I met Bainbridge at Paddington Station, and we were soon flying westward in the luxurious private compartment that had been reserved for him. I could see by his abstracted manner and his long lapses of silence that the mysterious affair at Felwyn Tunnel was occupying all his thoughts. It was two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the train slowed down at the little station of Felwyn. The station-master was at the door in an instant to receive us. \"I have some terribly bad news for you, sir,\" he said, turning to Bainbridge as we alighted; \"and yet in one sense it is a relief, for it seems to clear Wynne.\" \"What do you mean?\" cried Bainbridge. \"Bad news? Speak out at once!\" \"Well, sir, it is this: there has been another death at Felwyn signal-box. John Davidson, who was on duty last...", "...sweet face.

Sometimes <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she went to chat with the postilions. Madame was in her room upstairs. She wore an open dressing-gown, that showed between the shawl facings of her bodice a pleated chemisette with three gold buttons.

The oyster pirates, a fleet of a dozen sloops, were lying at anchor on what was known as the \"Deserted Beds.\" The _Coal Tar Maggie_ came sloshing into their midst with a light breeze astern, and they crowded on deck to see us.

The fever was gone and the bronze of Tayoga's face assumed a healthful tint. Then Robert took a piece of venison, and pounded it well between two stones.

It was our habit to board the yacht down Staten Island way on Saturday afternoon, sail out to the lightship and back, and anchor in the Horseshoe for dinner and the night. On Sunday we sailed out toward Fire Island or down toward Long Branch, or wherever else we chose. We were intent only upon rest--the rest that the sea alone can give, and that only the lovers of the sea ever get in this utterly unrestful world of ours. On deck <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and evening, and in the saloon at dinner and other meals, we talked, I suppose, of intellectual things. At sea we rested, and smoked, and were silent, and altogether happy. I have always enjoyed the sea.

At three miles above the camp we found some water; soon after we got the tracks of one horse and saw that he had been about there for a day or two, as the tracks were that age. We made a sweep out round some hills, found the tracks again, much fresher, and came upon the horse about seven miles from the camp. The other horse was left for to-morrow.

Sand went back to the Weinberg, and sat down to the midday table d'hote, where he dined with an appearance of such calmness, and even of such happiness, that his conversation, which was now lively, now simple, and now dignified, was remarked by everybody. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he returned a third time to the house of Kotzebue, who was giving a great dinner that day; but orders had been given to admit Sand. He was shown into a little room opening out of the anteroom, and a moment after, Kotzebue came in. Sand then performed the drama which he had rehearsed upon his friend A. S.

Aunt Izzie rapped her over the head with a thimble, and told her that she was a very naughty child, whereupon Johnnie pouted, and cried a little. Aunt Izzie wiped up the slop, and taking away the Elixir, retired with it to her closet, saying that she \"never knew anything like it--it was always so on Mondays.\" What further pranks were played in the nursery that day, I cannot pretend to tell. But late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a dreadful screaming was heard, and when people rushed from all parts of the house to see what was the matter, behold the nursery door was locked, and nobody could get in. Aunt Izzie called through the keyhole to have it opened, but the roars were so loud that it was long before she could get an answer. At last Elsie, sobbing violently, explained that Dorry had locked the door, and now the key wouldn't turn, and they couldn't open it. _Would_ they have to stay there...", "...alone, from its semi-cylindrical front, projected a glow upon the dusky vagueness of the Common, and as I passed it I heard in the hot stillness the click of a pair of billiard balls. As 'every one' was out of town perhaps the servants, in the extravagance of their leisure, were profaning the tables. The heat was insufferable and I thought with joy of the morrow, of the deck of the steamer, the freshening breeze, the sense of getting out to sea. I was even glad of what I had learned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at the office of the company--that at the eleventh hour an old ship with a lower standard of speed had been put on in place of the vessel in which I had taken my passage. America was roasting, England might very well be stuffy, and a slow passage (which at that season of the year would probably also be a fine one) was a guarantee of ten or twelve days of fresh air.

The Alcalde was a judicial officer under the Spanish and Mexican laws, having a jurisdiction something like that of a Justice of the Peace; but in the anomalous condition of affairs in California at that time, he, as a matter of necessity, assumed and exercised very great powers. The election ordered took place <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day. I had modestly whispered to different persons at the meeting in the new house the night before, that my name was mentioned by my friends for the office of Alcalde; and my nomination followed.

Although both Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland are frozen, the air always retains a damp, raw, penetrating quality, and the snow is more frequently sticky and clammy than dry and crystalline. Few, indeed, are the days which are not cheerless and depressing. In December, when the sky is overcast for weeks together, the sun, rising after nine o'clock, and sliding along just above the horizon, enables you to dispense with lamplight somewhere between ten and eleven; but by two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> you must call for lights again. Even when a clear day comes, the yellow, level sunshine is a combination of sunrise and sunset, and neither tempers the air nor mitigates the general expression of gloom, almost of despair, upon the face of Nature.

Water was running short. The Nile was only four miles away; but the column were impeded by their wounded and stores, and between the river and the thirsty men lay the Dervish army, infuriated by their losses and fully aware of the sore straits to which their astonishing enemy was now reduced. It now became necessary to divide the small force. Some must remain to guard the baggage and the wounded; the others must fight their way to the water. At three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 19th, 900 men left the hastily made zeriba and marched towards the river. Without their camels or those of the transport they appeared insignificant, a mere speck on the broad plain of Metemma. The Dervishes hastened to clinch the matter.

Operations in the West now claim attention. General Bragg, soon after taking command, as has been previously stated, advanced from Tupelo and occupied Chattanooga. Meantime General E. K.

After several small and successful affairs, he reached Richmond <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of August 30th. Here a force of the enemy had been collected to check his progress, but it was speedily routed, with the loss of some hundred killed and several thousand made prisoners, and a large number of small-arms, artillery, and wagons were captured. Lexington was next occupied; thence he advanced to Frankfort; and, moving forward toward the Ohio River, a great alarm was created in Cincinnati, then so little prepared for defense that, had his campaign been an...", "...hoisted above Fort Mandan; and all that night the men danced hilariously. On New Years of 1805, the white men visited the Mandan lodges, and one _voyageur_ danced \"on his head\" to the uproarious applause of the savages.

By the end of March, the river had cleared of ice, and a dozen men were sent back to St. Louis. At five, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of April 7, six canoes and two pirogues were pushed out on the Missouri. Sails were hoisted; a cheer from the Canadian traders and Indians standing on the shore--and the boats glided up the Missouri with flags flying from foremost prow.

It may be mentioned that these frigates had appeared off the anchorage of the French fleet, and had been recognized by it as enemies; but, so far from taking warning from the incident, the French admiral was only confirmed by it in a blind belief that the British feared to attack. Immediately after Troubridge's return, the fleet bore up under all sail, and at 2.45 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the 1st of August, 1798, the masthead lookout of the \"Zealous\" discovered the long-sought-for enemy, lying in Aboukir Bay, on the coast of Egypt, fifteen miles east of Alexandria. Suspense was ended, but Nelson's weightiest responsibility had yet to be met.

He seemed to have a foreboding of his approaching end, however, for the next day he said to one of his family: \"I feel that it is the last time I shall ever appear on a like public occasion.\" His fears were prophetic. He was seized with an attack of paralysis on the morning of the 9th of February, 1869, and breathed his last at five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the same day. He died in the communion of the Catholic Church, and was buried from St. Patrick's Cathedral, in the city of New York. His death drew forth expressions of sympathy and respect from all parts of the Union and from men of all shades of opinion. All felt that a good and useful man, a great advocate, and an incorruptible citizen had been taken away. His was a happy fate. He died in the fullness of his fame, before age had weakened his faculties or...", "...you do it?\" asked Mr. Juxon, anxious to have the matter decided. \"Why not go together?\" suggested the vicar. \"No,\" said Mr. Juxon firmly. \"It would be an intolerable ordeal for the poor woman. I think I see your objection. Perhaps you think that Mrs. Ambrose--\" \"Exactly, Mrs. Ambrose,\" echoed the vicar with a grim smile. \"Oh precisely--then I will do it,\" said the squire. And he forthwith did, and was very much surprised at the result. CHAPTER XV.

In spite of their mutual anxiety to be of service to Mrs. Goddard, when they had once decided how to act they had easily fallen into conversation about other matters, the black letter Paracelsus had received its full share of attention and many another rare volume had been brought out and examined. Neither the vicar nor his host believed that there was any hurry; if Goddard ever succeeded in...", "...had inhabited, and there had him hung; unto the son, however, who understood nothing of his father's arts, he gave his choice,--to die, or snuff some of the powder.

Chasid had him locked up in an iron cage, and hung in his garden. Long and happily lived Caliph Chasid with his spouse, the Princess; his pleasantest hours were always those, when <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the Vizier sought him; and whenever the Caliph was in a very good humor, he would let himself down so far, as to show Mansor how he looked, when a stork. He would gravely march along, with rigid feet, up and down the chamber, make a clattering noise, wave his arms like wings, and show how, in vain, he had prostrated himself to the East, and cried out, MU--MU. To the Princess and her children, this imitation always afforded great amusement: when, however, the Caliph...", "...airfield.

It was only when they passed her door that they trod softly. Someone standing outside whispered to them: \"Pst! be quiet! The lady keeps her bed!\" \"If she keeps her bed, she must be ill!\" so thought they all. When it was dark, Barbara Pirka came down again and lit the lamp in Michal's room. How happy the evening hours had been to Michal at home, when she...", "...Will! I beg your pardon. I am very sorry. Won't you forgive me?\" She who had always drawn back, and been so reserved, said this in the very softest manner; with eyes now uplifted beseechingly, now dropped to the ground. Her sweet confusion told more than words could do; and Will turned back, all joyous in his certainty of being beloved, and took her in his arms, and kissed her. \"My own Susan!\" he said. Meanwhile the mother watched her child in the room above. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before she awoke, for the sleeping draught had been very powerful. The instant she awoke, her eyes were fixed on her mother's face with a gaze as unflinching as if she were fascinated. Mrs. Leigh did not turn away, nor move; for it seemed as if motion would unlock the stony command over herself which, while so perfectly still, she was enabled to preserve.

When the messenger arrived on the morning of the 14th, he was informed that the reply was considered unsatisfactory, and that no further communication would be held with the Japanese except under a flag of truce.

On his return <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the commanders of the various ships were summoned on board the flagship to receive their instructions from the Admiral. There was no intention on our part of immediately attacking the batteries, but the Admiral probably supposed that by adopting reprisals, that is taking possession of the steamers, he would induce the Satsuma men to give some more satisfactory reply than that already received.

It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the work was finished, and I began putting over one of my brigades; but in the midst of its crossing word came that Longstreet's army was moving to attack us, which caused an abandonment of the foraging project, and orders quickly followed to retire to Strawberry Plains, the retrograde movement to begin forthwith.

Mr. Andrews reproached him for coming to Dartford Mills in such a guise, at such a time of night, and, 'turning to the other side of the bed, rang the bell, when Lord Lyttelton had disappeared.' The house and garden were searched in vain; and about four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a friend arrived at Dartford with tidings of his lordship's death. Here the reader with true common sense remarks that this second ghost, Lord Lyttelton's own, does not appear in evidence till 1828, fifty years after date, and then in an anonymous book, on no authority. We have permitted to the reader this opportunity of exercising his acuteness, while laying a little trap for him. It is not in 1828 that Mr. Andrews's story first appears.

He was wrapped in a thick Mackinaw coat, with a cloth cap pulled down over his ears; and he wore big overshoes, which buckled near to his knees. There was a heavy pack on his pack; it contained a change of socks (for himself), and many pounds of \"readin' matter\" (for \"the boys\"). He had preached in the morning at one camp, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at another, and was now bound to a third, where (as it turned out) a hearty welcome was waiting.

He turned to the soldiers of the Old Guard who accompanied him, and said,-- \"Yes, grenadiers, we are going to France, to Paris.\" Enthusiastic \"_vivas_\" followed his announcement, which told a tale of future glory to those war-hardened veterans. They had fought for the Emperor on many a mighty field. They were ready to dare new dangers in the hope of new triumphs. On the morning of Wednesday, March 1, the shores of France were visible from the vessel's deck. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> anchor was dropped in the Bay of Juan. Cheers and salvos of artillery greeted those welcome shores; the boats were quickly dropped, and by five o'clock the whole expedition was on shore. The soldiers made their bivouac in an olive grove on the borders of the bay. \"Happy omen!\" said Napoleon; \"the olive is the emblem of peace.\" He plucked some violets, and then sat down and consulted his maps, which were spread on a table before him. There were two routes which...", "...leave their places of refuge.

His muscles were so stiff from remaining such a long time in his cramped position that it was with difficulty that he was able to walk.

He frequently brought the child to the office, to make a little call upon her, and the two soon began to grow very fond of each other. Then, too, Monsieur Lamonti would often call for her <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to go for a drive with them, and, upon several occasions, he had invited her to be present when he made a small fete for his granddaughter, to assist in entertaining the children, since he had no mistress in his home to manage such festivities, and he had learned that she dearly loved little ones. At such times he exerted himself to make the occasion pleasant for her in other ways--by showing her works of art and numerous curios which he had gathered from various...", "...ten days, and that he had not liked leaving his daughter so lonely during the holidays.

Mr. J. Jervice had two reasons for stopping. One was that he wanted himself to be seen a good, long distance away from the bank, so that he could prove that he was far distant from that region if any robbery occurred. The other was a natural cupidity which...", "...next advice be?\" \"Aspire.\" \"But what then?\" \"Aspire.\" Chicago believes in that advice. She has always believed in it.

When Maurice went out to school <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he knew that his mother had a headache, but by the time he came home he had forgotten all about it, and so he stamped in with his muddy shoes unwiped, leaving the front door wide open. His mother said, \"Close the door, Maurice,\" and he gave it a great bang, which made her shudder. Next he walked into the room, flung his bag on a chair, his cap on the floor, and his overcoat on the sofa. Then he said in a loud voice, \"Well, mother, how's your head?\" His poor mother...", "...Germany, and have no wish to return.\" Singularly enough, there were also two Italian organ grinders on board, whom I accosted in their native language; but they seemed neither surprised nor particularly pleased. They dropped hints of having been engaged in some political conspiracy; and one of them said, with a curious mixture of Italian and Norsk words \"_Jeg voglio ikke ritornare_.\" I said the same thing (\"I shall not return\") as I left Vadso. We sailed early the next morning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> reached Vardo, where we lay three hours. Here we took on board the three officers, who had in the meantime made their inspection. Vardohuus is a single star-shaped fort, with six guns and a garrison of twenty-seven men. During the recent war, the garrison was increased to three hundred--an unnecessary precaution, if there was really any danger of an attack to be apprehended, so long as the defences of the place were not strengthened. One of the officers, who had gone...", "...not uttering a single threat, for they felt no hatred to the soldiers, who belong, like themselves, to the people. They were quartered in Belleville church. Their arrival caused a fatal diversion. The people ran up to see them pass, and the Place des Fetes was dismantled. The Versaillese came up, occupied it, and the last defenders of the Buttes fell back on the Faubourg du Temple and the Rue de Paris. While our front was yielding we were attacked from the rear. Since four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the Versaillese had been laying siege to the Pere Lachaise, which enclosed no more than 200 Federals, resolute, but without discipline or foresight. The officers had been unable to make them embattle the walls. Five thousand Versaillese approached the enceinte from all sides, while the artillery of the bastion furrowed the interior. The pieces of the Commune had scarcely any munition since the afternoon. At six o'clock the Versaillese, not daring, in spite of their...", "...the sudden storm of cheers and \"booh's\" I leaned over to Joe at my side: \"Why did you let that man speak?\" The frown tightened on Joe's face. \"Because he's one of us,\" he said. Seven more ships had sailed by that night. In front of the docksheds, outside the double line of police, the throng had grown denser day by day, and each time the \"scabs\" came out there had been a burst of imprecations, a fierce pressing forward. The police had repeatedly used their clubs. Now late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a red hospital ambulance came clanging down the waterfront. It was greeted by triumphant shouts. \"Some black bastard hurt at last!\" There was a quick gathering of police and a lane was formed reaching into the dock. Through this lane drove the ambulance, and as presently it emerged it was greeted by tumultuous cheers. The papers the next morning said that a raging, howling mob had tried to reach the injured man. Cries of \"Sabotage!\" had been heard. Two men, they...", "...day of publication, precisely at noon, copies of \"Harold\" were laid upon the desks of all the literary editors in England and America. My book reviews for that day were already in type and in the forms. One hour later the first edition of the paper--the latest into which book reviews could go--must go to press. I knew that my good friends, the literary editors of the morning newspapers, would exploit this great literary news the next morning, and that the evening papers would have it <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> following. I resolved to be ahead of all of them. I hurriedly sent for the foreman of the composing room and enlisted his cooperation. With the aid of my scissors I got two columns of matter ready, consisting mainly of quotations hastily clipped from the book, with a connective tissue of comment, and with an introductory paragraph or two giving the first news of the publication of an important and very ambitious dramatic poem by Tennyson. At one o'clock the...", "...Miss Blake considered a moment. \"I don't see any reason why it might not be arranged.\" \"It's right by the sea and Ruth says they never fuss about clothes down there. Just anything will do.\" The governess smiled. \"Nevertheless I think you will need a couple of changes. I have sometimes been asked to visit country houses where 'anything would do,' and I've generally found that it all depends on what one understands by 'anything.'\" \"I can wear a shirt-waist in the morning and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I can wear a--a--another one,\" announced Nan. Miss Blake laughed. \"You poor child,\" she said, \"I do believe you haven't much beside for the summer.\" \"You see,\" broke in Nan, shamefacedly, \"Delia didn't know anything about styles and I didn't--care, and so we sort of let clothes go. It isn't because father wouldn't want me to have nice things.\" Miss Blake took her up quickly. \"I know it is not. And now we must set to work at once to get you properly provided,...", "...me to show it to the Treasurer. 28th August, 1670. One of the Canons preached; then followed the offering of the Knights of the Order, according to custom; first the poor Knights, in procession, then, the Canons in their formalities, the Dean and Chancellor, then his Majesty (the Sovereign), the Duke of York, Prince Rupert; and, lastly, the Earl of Oxford, being all the Knights that were then at Court. I dined with the Treasurer, and consulted with him what pieces I was to add; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the King took me aside into the balcony over the terrace, extremely pleased with what had been told him I had begun, in order to his commands, and enjoining me to proceed vigorously in it. He told me he had ordered the Secretaries of State to give me all necessary assistance of papers and particulars relating to it and enjoining me to make it a LITTLE KEEN, for that the Hollanders had very unhandsomely abused him in their pictures, books, and libels. Windsor was now...", "...we fallen in with it in the night, we must unavoidably have been bewildered, if we had not all perished; as notwithstanding the advantage of a clear day, and having used every possible precaution, it was with the utmost difficulty that we crossed it without broken limbs.

[Sidenote: 24th.] [Sidenote: 25th.] The twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth proved fine, clear weather, though excessively cold; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the latter, we arrived at Prince of Wales's Fort, after having been absent eight months and twenty-two days, on a fruitless, or at least an unsuccessful journey.[44] FOOTNOTES: [X] This only consisted of three walking-sticks stuck into the ground, and a blanket thrown over them.

Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the traveler found the cabin of a white trapper for which he had started that morning. \"Can you tell me where Charley Seguis is?\" he asked. \"Went north, toward Beaver Lake, three days ago,\" replied the other, shortly. \"He stopped here on his way up, and said he was looking for better grounds.\" \"Going to set out a new line of traps then, was he?\" \"Yes, Mr. McTavish,\" assented the trapper. \"Thanks,\" said McTavish, gathering up the whip. \"I must be going.\"...", "...at any time after 1st July. A consignment is expected from the Baltic within the next fortnight.\" The little clerk looked up. His glance inquired, \"Is that all?\" \"Wait a minute.\" His master seemed to be reflecting; then leaning back in his chair and gripping its arms while he stared out of the bow-window before him, he resumed his dictation-- \"I hope to be in Plymouth on Wednesday next, and that you will hold yourself ready for a call between two and three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at your office.\" \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" the clerk interposed, \"but Mr. Samuel closes early on Wednesdays. \"I know it.

By nine o'clock at night he was in possession of five of these redans and, of course, of the connecting lines of rifle-pits. All of them contained artillery, which fell into our hands. Hancock came up and proposed to take any part assigned to him; and Smith asked him to relieve his men who were in the trenches. Next morning, the 16th, Hancock himself was in command, and captured another redan. Meade came up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and succeeded Hancock, who had to be relieved, temporarily, from the command of his corps on account of the breaking out afresh of the wound he had received at Gettysburg. During the day Meade assaulted and carried one more redan to his right and two to his left. In all this we lost very heavily. The works were not strongly manned, but they all had guns in them which fell into our hands, together with the men who were handling them in the effort to repel these...", "...subdued him. \"What about the trunks?\" asked the young woman. \"Fetch 'em to-morrow,\" he answered tersely. Tommy regarded the slender looking buck-board apprehensively. \"Buthter better walk,\" she decided. \"The wagon won't hold her.\" \"Now, now, Tommy, do stop teasing Buster. If the wagon goes down Margery will go down with it,\" answered Harriet laughingly. \"And she will fall a great deal harder than will you,\" added Miss Elting, at which there was a merry laugh. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they finally climbed into the buck-board which sagged in the middle until all the girls began to grow apprehensive. They started away along a country road a gay party, indeed, but Harriet noted that horse and driver were not well matched.

Their driver, however, appeared to have perfect control over the animal, so Harriet...", "...word \"male\" and thus securing civil and political rights to the women of the State. It was a very active campaign. Crowded meetings were held in all the chief towns and cities.

The Methodist conference passed a resolution in favor of the amendment by a unanimous vote. I was in the State during the intense heat of May and June, speaking every evening to large audiences; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to women alone, and preaching every Sunday in some pulpit. The Methodists, Universalists, Unitarians, and Quakers all threw open their churches to the apostles of the new gospel of equality for women. We spoke in jails, prisons, asylums, depots, and the open air. Wherever there were ears to hear, we lifted up our voices, and, on the wings of the wind, the glad tidings were carried to the remote corners of the State, and the votes of forty thousand men, on election day,...", "...a very little while they had dwindled to a point of light and were soon mixed with the sky. But I went on more lonely along the crest of the hills, very human, riding my horse Monster, a mortal horse--I had almost written a human horse. My mind was full of silence. Some of those to whom I have related this adventure criticise it by the method of questions and of cross-examination proving that it could not have happened precisely where it did; showing that I left the vale so late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that I could not have found this man and his mount at the hour I say I did, and making all manner of comments upon the exact way in which the feathers (which they say are those of a bird) grew out of the hide of the horse, and so forth. There are no witnesses of the matter, and I go lonely, for many people will not believe, and those who do believe believe too much.

The rocks would hold her tight, but I don't believe there's much left of her. Nothing worth taking away, I guess.\" Jack gave Dick a peculiar look, and neither of the boys told what they had seen.

I do not like those week-day baptisms. Where they have the communion lecture <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of a week-day, there may be reasons of convenience for bringing the children for baptism then, rather than on the Sabbath; but there is a great loss of enjoyment, and also of impressiveness, in the ordinance, in doing so, I think. I was at a place, several years ago, when fourteen children were baptized on a Wednesday afternoon, in the church. I went to see it, but it was not solemn at all. I could not help thinking what an impressive and useful sight that would have...", "...he said, \"and bear him to my house.\" The men took the body on their shoulders and bore him to a barrow. The father walked before it bare-headed and pale, his eyes bathed in tears; and to all who questioned him about this strange procession, carrying a dead man through the town without a priest, replied: \"It is my son, Councillor Fischer, whom the Prussians have killed.\" And thus the news spread over Frankfort.

His notion of the weight of the coin, which in gold would amount to more than fifty tons, must have been a curious one. Seeing his men return without the money, General Falkenstein declared that if it were not forthcoming the next day he would permit pillage and bombardment....", "...in Gallipoli, and then lay down on their beds and slept. At midday they were called, turned out--horribly sleepy--and began to roll up their bedding and pack up the rest of their \"gear\", ready to be taken down to the beach. Most of the officers spent the morning doing the same. The barometer had now begun to fall--ever so slightly---and some clouds to gather in the west, low down in the horizon, behind the island of Tenedos. Everyone felt a little anxious. At three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the breeze definitely shifted round to the south-west--the dangerous quarter--and all knew that if it increased much it would drive seas right on to the beaches, and add tremendously to the difficulties of this last night's work. At five o'clock that afternoon many of the officers gathered in the Mess, which they were leaving for ever, and drank to the success of the evacuation. \"Kaiser Bill\" was taken out of his box, placed on the table, and drank a little milk out...", "...that life of mine, however much I cared for them, only as the thought I seem to them to be.

They intended the next morning to cross to Havre, and thence to Paris--a place Cytherea had never visited--for their wedding tour. The afternoon drew on. The packing was done. Cytherea was so restless that she could stay still nowhere. Miss Aldclyffe, who, though she took little part in the day's proceedings, was, as it were, instinctively...", "...so long. The air is really wonderful, so clear and crisp and exhilarating. It makes me long for a good horse, and horses we intend to have as soon as possible.

Followed by El Capitan, nosing and snuffing gratefully at the cool waters, he waded the ford, and with his camera case swinging from his shoulder, galloped up the opposite bank and back into the trail.

When it was all over, Her Majesty gave each of us a small purse made of red satin embroidered with gold, containing a sum of money. This is to enable each one to commence the New Year with a kind of reserve...", "...and don't take any wooden money.\" Harry, also smiling, replied in the same vein; but the smile died on his lips and the words turned to gall in his mouth as he thought what a bitter travesty this was of former partings, when their gaiety was either natural or intended to hide the sorrow of parting, and not, as now, wholly forced and affected to conceal the relief that each could not but feel in being far from the other.

It was also very windy, which made it seem colder to everybody except the thermometer; and as the thermometer alone exhibited signs of being able to stand a temperature of twenty or thirty or even forty degrees colder without suffering disagreeable consequences, that seemed rather unfair.

About two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the boys concluded that it was about time to start for home; so, after putting out the fire and fastening the door of the cabin, they set out. Archie led the way, with a 'coon slung over each shoulder, and another dangling from his belt behind. The others followed close after him, in \"Indian file.\" In this manner they marched through the woods, joking and shouting, and talking over the events of the day, and now and then indulging in a hearty laugh when they happened...", "...\"Thar's been redskins and Frenchies here,\" said one of the band, as he pointed to a narrow track in the snow. \"They passed last night, I should reckon.\" \"And blazed a fresh trail,\" added Steve swiftly. \"Look over there.\" His sharp eye had seen a white clip in the side of a tree some distance away, and closer inspection and a little search showed that he was not in error. \"The Hawk has an eye of which the finest chief might be proud,\" said Silver Fox. \"These men passed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of yesterday.

Of course the intention of these aeroplane bomb-throwers, of whose exploits we shall probably hear a great deal, was to create a panic and demoralize the inhabitants, and especially to terrify women and children. This utterly failed. After dropping the three bombs and his _carte de visite_, the German aeroplane vanished towards the east.

Doggie, who was beginning to acquire a sense of rueful humour, smiled and was appeased. It was only <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that he saw the girl again. She was standing in the doorway of the house, with her hand on her bosom, as though she had just come out to breathe fresh air, when Doggie and his two friends emerged from the yard. As their eyes met, she greeted him with her sad little smile. Emboldened, he stepped forward. \"_Bon jour, mademoiselle._\" \"_Bon jour, monsieur._\" \"I hope madame your aunt is better to-day.\" She seemed to derive some dry amusement from his solicitude....", "...but as far as she was able to determine the child saw nothing of her surroundings. The crowds of trimly dressed people, the nursemaids and babies, the swift slim outlines of the whizzing motors, even the battleships lying so suggestively quiescent on the river before them--all the spectacular, vivid panorama of afternoon on Riverside Drive--seemed absolutely without interest or savor to the child.

His voice, naturally a beautiful one, with its slight Oxford peculiarities, fascinated Claire. She listened with joy as he passed from Shelley to Keats and wound up with Swinburne. Afterwards the captain took them into his room for tea and they sat talking until it was almost time to change. They descended from the bridge together. \"To-night,\" Claire exclaimed happily, \"we dance.\" Gregory made no reply....", "...martyrdom. After breakfast every one started in a different direction, but search and hunt as children, maids, and men did in every conceivable nook and corner, there was no trace of the missing slipper, and at last they were forced to give up the search, and admit that apparently it had simply vanished from the face of the earth. \"But it must be somewhere,\" Miss Martin repeated. \"It didn't walk away by itself. I won't give up.\" By dinner-time the fruitless search was over, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the children scattered to their play, Polly and Tom escorting Lydia and Roger in a tour of the vegetable garden, hoping thus to raise the drooping spirits of their visitors. Miss Martin missed Mary Ellen, and going in search of her, found her in her bedroom, leaning on the window-sill from which the bronze slipper had taken its mysterious flight. The little girl had nursed her sense of injury all day, and now had stolen away from the other children to spend a...", "...A curious mound, constructed entirely of shells, rudely heaped together, measuring thirty feet in diameter, and fourteen feet in height, was also noticed near the beach, and was supposed to be a burying-place of the Indians. April 23. Upon leaving the inner harbour we anchored in Knocker's Bay, on the west side of the port, which received the name of Essington, a tribute of my respect for the memory of my lamented friend, the late Vice-Admiral Sir William Essington, K.C.B.: and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we set off to examine an opening in the mangroves at the bottom of the bay. After pulling through its various winding channels for about a mile, where it was scarcely broad enough for the boat to pass, its further investigation was given up, and we commenced our return, but the mangroves were so thick, and formed so impervious a net-work, that we had great difficulty in effecting it. When about halfway towards the mouth, we found the boat impeded by the roots of a...", "...not choose one or the other, we need only wait to have both; for spring is the modulation to the dominant, the awakening, the going out in search of adventure, while autumn is the return to the tonic, the coming home in search of repose, the falling asleep; the first leads to the second as naturally as youth leads to age. Last time Gigino and I went to Trabonella it was spring, and we took with us his young brother Michelino, aged thirteen, who had never been there before. We arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and found Beppe, who took us round, and we showed Michelino the works. Empty trucks were gliding down a sloping railway into the mine, while others were gliding up filled with the harvest of the deep. We saw the broken pieces of rock being put into great furnaces and we watched the treacly sulphur that was melted out of the pores and came oozing through a tap into a mould. It is then purified and made into shapes like candles, and I thought of Kentish giants...", "...position. Here was evidently a sad misconception of the state of affairs, for, when the Commander-in-Chief, an hour later, arrived on the field and consulted with General Hooker, the men were ordered forward once more to occupy the ground they had once taken and surrendered. This time there was less resistance. The rebels steadily gave way, giving up their rifle pits and yielding the whole of the open field. Under cover of the forest beyond the field they made another stand, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a brigade charged upon our lines; but they were bravely met by men of Grover's brigade, and driven back, leaving three hundred of their dead on the field. By the action of this day, our line was advanced on the left nearly a mile. The victory, such as it was, cost us six hundred and forty men in killed and wounded. The men remained under arms all night, in readiness to meet the frequent sorties of the enemy, who intended nothing more serious than preventing...", "...accepted blur of violet and silver. The various hours and successive aspects, the different strong passages of our reverse process, on the other hand, still figure for me even as some series of sublime landscape-frescoes-- if the great Claude, say, had ever used that medium--in the immense gallery of a palace; the homeward run by Capua, Terracina, Gaeta and its storied headland fortress, across the deep, strong, indescribable Pontine Marshes, white-cattled, strangely pastoral, sleeping <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> glow, yet stirred by the near sea-breath. Thick somehow to the imagination as some full-bodied sweetness of syrup is thick to the palate the atmosphere of that region--thick with the sense of history and the very taste of time; as if the haunt and home (which indeed it is) of some great fair bovine aristocracy attended and guarded by halberdiers in the form of the mounted and long-lanced herdsmen, admirably congruous with the whole picture at every point, and never...", "...not been able to keep the thought of him from her mind. They had been intimate friends at one time; but this was while they were both very young. Then he had professed for her a boyish passion; and she had loved him with the childish fondness of a young school-girl. As they grew older, circumstances separated them more; and though no hearts were broken in consequence, both often thought of the early days of innocence and affection with pleasure. Mary sat sewing, as we have said, late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the day on which the incident at the auction room occurred, when there was a tap at her door. On opening it, Mr. Edwards stood before her. She stepped back a pace or two in instant surprise and confusion, and he advanced into the desolate room. In a moment, however, Mary recovered herself, and with as much self-possession as, under the circumstances, she could assume, asked her unexpected visitor to take a chair, which she offered him. Mr. Edwards sat down,...", "...As a signal to the country round, the flags of each village are brought out on the day fixed and set upon the road that leads to the place of meeting. This incites the young men and maidens to hurry through their morning's work and look up their _jatra_ dresses, which are by no means ordinary attire. Those who have some miles to go put up their finery in a bundle to keep it fresh and clean, and proceed to some tank or stream in the vicinity of the tryst grove; and about two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> may be seen all around groups of girls laughingly making their toilets in the open air, and young men in separate parties similarly employed. When they are ready the drums are beaten, huge horns are blown, and thus summoned the group from each village forms its procession. In front are young men with swords and shields or other weapons, the village standard-bearers with their flags, and boys waving yaks' tails or bearing poles with fantastic arrangements of garlands...", "...rock you see standing at the right of any opening and we'll put in there so quick it will make your heads swim.\" \"Trust us to keep a close watch,\" said Fred emphatically. \"We won't let any guilty rock escape.\" \"You bet we won't!\" echoed Bill. Their excitement chased away from the boys' minds any idea of getting a regular meal, and they contented themselves with hasty bites of whatever was found at hand, while they kept their eyes glued to the irregular coast line. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when a shout came from Bill. \"There's a big rock, the biggest that we've seen,\" he cried, pointing to the right. Both boats turned in the direction indicated. Ross, in his eagerness, made his engine hum and came first in sight of a cove that opened out beyond the rock, and a shout went up that thrilled the hearts of those in the _Ariel_ ploughing on behind. \"Here it is!\" yelled Teddy exultingly. \"Three trees standing together and two more a hundred feet away....", "...quiet as she is, she would miss a rattletybang person like me twice as much. I had never thought of _her_ getting lonely, but she'd be bound to if I went away. How'd I feel if she'd gone with Joyce and I had to stay here day after day alone, and know that I'd never have her again except on flying visits, and that she was wrapped up in all sorts of interests that I could never have a part in?\" All that evening she thought about it, and all next morning; and when Mrs. Ware came home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she met her with a serious question: \"Mamma, when I'm away from home and you're here by yourself, do you miss me as much as I do you?\" \"Oh, a thousand times more!\" was the quick answer. \"Then I've made up my mind. Promised Land or no Promised Land, I'm not going away to stay until Jack brings Betty here to take my place.\" Taken by surprise, the look which illuminated Mrs. Ware's face for a moment showed more plainly than she had intended Mary to know, how...", "...It would be sure ruin to try any new schemes at this moment.\" \"You are rattled yourself, Lawson. There's no need for excitement. I merely offered the suggestion. Everything is going well,\" he reassured me, but the picture his words conjured before my mind disturbed me all day. That he would dare do what he had suggested I did not credit, for the assurances I had were too solemn to allow me to believe such treachery could be meditated. Nevertheless I brooded over the matter, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> ran down to 26 Broadway, ostensibly to hear the latest news from the bank, but really to try if I could not look into Mr. Rogers' head and see if the imps I had sighted early in the day were still there. Mr. Rogers was over with Stillman at the bank. In half an hour he came in, and the excitement he labored under was plainly evident in his face. \"Lawson,\" he said, \"no one has ever seen anything like this before. Stillman is bewildered. He says it looks as though by...", "...had been rounding up half a dozen hardy, tiny burros, those diminutive donkeys which can carry their own weight of freight all day long up and down steep mountain trails. It was decided to take these along for the use of the travelers. With the obstinacy of their breed, however, there was never a time throughout the day when one or more and sometimes all of the burros were not balking at this long trip away from the ranch where food and rest were awaiting them. Accordingly, it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when the party reached the range behind which was hidden Machu Pichu. Suddenly Joe, who with Hen, mounted on spare horses, was piloting the little troop, caught sight of a flicker of light across the crest of the highest peak of the range ahead of them. At first he thought that it came from the rays of the setting sun reflected from a bit of polished quartz. Suddenly he noticed, with a sudden plunge of his heart, that the light was flickering in spaced, irregular...", "...wait, for he said to the Admiral, from his caravel, that he had seen a great multitude of birds flying westward, that he hoped to see land that night, and that he therefore pressed onward. A great cloud appeared in the north, which is a sign of the proximity of land. _Wednesday, 19th of September_ The Admiral continued on his course, and during the day and night he made but 25 leagues because it was calm. He counted 22. This day, at 10 o'clock, a booby[98-1] came to the ship, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> another arrived, these birds not generally going more than 20 leagues from the land. There was also some drizzling rain without wind, which is a sure sign of land. The Admiral did not wish to cause delay by beating to windward to ascertain whether land was near, but he considered it certain that there were islands both to the north and south of his position, (as indeed there were, and he was passing through the middle of them). For his desire was to press onwards to...", "...grinding rustily. We were in the midst of a desolate waste of sand and water. The bar upon which we had lodged was utterly bare. Drinking a can of condensed milk between us, we pushed on. That day we found ourselves in the country of red barns. It was like warming cold hands before an open grate to look upon them. At noon we saw the first wheat-field of the trip--an undulating golden flood, dimpled with the tripping feet of the wind. These were two joys--quite enough for one day. But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the third came--the first golden-rod. My first impulse was to take off my hat to it, offer it my hand. That evening we pulled up to a great bank, black-veined with outcrops of coal, and cooked supper over a civilized fire. For many miles along the river in North Dakota, as well as along the Yellowstone in Montana, these coal outcrops are in evidence. Doubtless, within another generation, vast mining operations will be opened up in these localities. Coal barges will...", "...of this day. We were much ridiculed by two gentlemen of the party on announcing our intended proceedings, for they seemed to think no elephants were near, and that we were a couple of blockheads for troubling ourselves to go out. Not regarding these remarks, we started, and having been careful to select saddles that did not creak and curb-chains that did not jingle, we advanced with tolerable silence to the part of the forest from whence emanated the sounds that had shown me <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the presence of a troop of elephants. We halted at about two hundred yards from the tall trees that fringed this part, and listened for any indications. Our patience was not severely tried, as we heard one or two branches smashed as none but an elephant could have smashed them. We immediately took up our position a little nearer, and behind some bushes, so that we might not be seen by any elephants when they came to drink at the pools of water near. We waited for...", "...with him never to allude to June. She might take alarm, he did not know what she might think; he hastened, therefore, to banish from his manner all traces of absorption, but in this he was about as successful as his father would have been, for he had inherited all old Jolyon's transparency in matters of domestic finesse; and young Mrs. Jolyon, busying herself over the affairs of the house, went about with tightened lips, stealing at him unfathomable looks. He started for the Club <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with the letter in his pocket, and without having made up his mind. To sound a man as to 'his intentions' was peculiarly unpleasant to him; nor did his own anomalous position diminish this unpleasantness. It was so like his family, so like all the people they knew and mixed with, to enforce what they called their rights over a man, to bring him up to the mark; so like them to carry their business principles into their private relations. And how that phrase in the...", "...the two lovers lunched together in the quaint old parlor of the inn. The girl, in her innocence of the customs of the world, was quite oblivious to the conventional necessity for a chaperon; so, without the embarrassment of a third party, they greatly enjoyed the wholesome and substantial meal provided for them by the skilful hands of the innkeeper's wife with whom Emily was a great favorite. They lingered a long time at the table in the cool old-fashioned room, and it was somewhat late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they started back to the Point, to which Revere had previously directed his man to repair with his baggage, by the land road. The constraint which had been put upon both of them by the necessities of the business which had called them to the village, and the presence of other people wherever they went, for the officious but well-meaning landlady had frequently interrupted the privacy of the parlor even, had been the strongest force in developing the growing...", "...found most of the servants assembled, all craning their necks. On came the _Taube_, and there we stood, gaping, never realizing an instant that we were running the slightest risk. The machine passed directly over our heads, not low enough, however, for us to distinguish its contents with the naked eye. \"There's another!\" shouted someone. And turning our backs on the enemy, we gave our entire attention to a second speck that had suddenly risen on the horizon. It was four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and the armored head of the ever-on-coming aeroplane glittered splendidly in the golden rays of the afternoon sun. \"_Cest un francais!_\" cried George. \"_Non!_\" Allowing that an aeroplane flies at the rate of a mile a minute, one can easily imagine that we had not long to wait before number two sped over us.

If this history attaches itself to a monastery like that in Canada, what must be the condition of the monasteries and nunneries of nations which have not the enlightenment that Canada has? I desire to call to the attention of the reader a little history that is not exceedingly old, and which every boy and girl is acquainted with, as it has transpired in the past ten years--yea, later. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of a December day, in 1900. A boy, Edward Cudahy, Jr., was walking to his father's mansion and was invited to step into a buggy and was informed that he was under arrest. This boy was then and there abducted, and this abduction became known by the boy remaining away from his home that night. The police and detectives of Omaha and the detectives from Chicago and other cities were busy on the case day and night. Days and weeks passed and nothing came to light except...", "...aright. The old man had written that his entire stock was worth no more than five hundred dollars, and since Roberta had procured more than that sum for him, he was making her a gift of the books that remained, and requested that she remove them at once, as the rent on the shop would expire the following day. The janitress, with an eye to business, at once said that her son, Jacob, was idle and could truck the books for the young lady wherever she wished them to go. It was two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when this conversation took place, and at five o'clock Gloria and Lena May, returning from the Settlement House, were amazed to see a skinny horse drawing a two-wheeled ash cart stopping at the curb in front of the Pensinger mansion. The driver was a Hebrew lad, but at his side sat no less a personage than Roberta, who beamed down upon her astonished sisters. After a moment of explanation the three girls assisted the boy Jacob to cart all the books to one of the...", "...hour whom those elders do not scan with knowledge. These wise young judges carry no secrets which the elders do not share. Is it a strange world that of Willis and his Philip Slingsby? It is the world of the moment and of this Commencement. But there is something else in Commencement besides this romance of feeling and tradition. It is the celebration of the intellectual life. The eloquence, indeed, is sometimes rather copious. An oration in the morning before one literary society; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before another; and a sermon in the evening before the Missionary Association, is good measure heaped up and running over. There is some jealousy also even in academic groves. In the older day, if the Melpomene had its oration in the morning and the Euterpe in the afternoon, and you read on the following Sunday, scrawled on the blank page of the hymn-book in the pew, \"Words, words, words, oration of Cicero,\" and \"Genius, eloquence, common-sense, oration of...", "...lawn, he exclaimed in some wonderment that the man he particularly wished to see was there. 'It must be Dollikins, the brewer. I've had him pointed out to me in Bevisham, and I never can light on him at his brewery.' No excuse for detaining the impetuous candidate struck Cecilia. She betook herself to Mrs. Lespel, to give and receive counsel in the emergency, while Beauchamp struck across the lawn to Mr. Dollikins, who had the squire of Itchincope on the other side of him. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> a report reached the ladies of a furious contest going on over Dollikins. Mr. Algy Borolick was the first to give them intelligence of it, and he declared that Beauchamp had wrested Dollikins from Grancey Lespel. This was contradicted subsequently by Mr. Stukely Culbrett.

I will tell you if you like.\" \"No, no,\" the girl replied hurriedly. \"I would rather be able to always take my oath on the holy relics that I know nothing about it.\" \"Very well,\" Malcolm replied; \"then this afternoon I will call.\" Having hidden away under his doublet the suit of boy's clothes, and with the tools of his trade in a small basket in his hand, Malcolm presented himself at three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to the sentry at the door leading to the count's apartments. The soldier glanced at the pass and permitted him to enter without remark. The waiting maid met him inside and conducted him upstairs, and ushered him into a spacious apartment, in which the count was lying on a couch, while the countess and Thekla sat at work beside him. She then retired and closed the door after her. The count and Thekla looked with surprise at the young artisan, but the countess ran to...", "...\"Fine as a ship,\" answered Edward Warren. \"The men around here cross the bay in them in pretty rough weather. We'll go out and take a few seas, and let you see how cleverly she rides.\" They headed out toward the mouth of the river, passed beyond the lighthouse, into the open waters of the bay. It was not rough, but there was some sea running. The canoe weathered it all surprisingly. They followed up the shore of the bay for a mile or two. Time passed quickly, and it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they left the light on their starboard hand in running back again. Edward Warren looked at his crew and laughed. \"You stood it well,\" he said. \"But you're a frozen looking lot, for all that. Winter's a chilly time for yachting, at its best.

None of the Grants were in, which deepened the mystery, and although he might have telephoned the Grant homestead and learned the cause of her absence, it occurred to Gardiner that his horse needed exercise, and he drove out early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to investigate the situation for himself. He trusted that Miss Vane was not ill, and he anticipated with some pleasure an invitation to remain to tea. As a matter of fact the invitation was given, but Gardiner did not remain.

Then the rudder was hooked on, and, as the rapid current bore them out beyond the point, the wind filled the sails, the boat careened over, the water rattled beneath her bows, and, as the little vessel seemed to stand still, the beautiful panorama of rocky, tree-adorned shore glided by, Sneeshing's furious barking growing more distant, and dying right away.

It was well on <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when Scoodrach, who was lying upon his chest with his chin resting on the boat's gunwale, suddenly exclaimed,-- \"There she is.\" The sun was shining down hotly, there was not a breath of air, and Kenneth, who seemed as languid as the drooping sails, slowly turned his head round to look at a cloud of smoke which appeared to be coming round a distant point of land. Hours had passed since they sailed away from Dunroe, and for a time they had had a favourable wind;...", "...betrayed his pleasure except by a glistening of the eyes. As soon as the warm weather came they would migrate, and immediately began their preparations--the young ones by packing and unpacking several times a day a most heterogeneous assemblage of things.

The trains did not then travel so fast as now, and it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when they reached the station at which they must leave the railway for the road. Before that the weather had changed, or they had changed their weather, for the sky was one mass of cloud, and rain was falling persistently. They had been for some time in the abode of the hills, but those they were passing through, though not without wonder and strange interest, were but an inferior clan, neither lofty nor lovely. Through the rain and the mist they looked lost and drear....", "...my lady,\" answered Mary, rising. \"I must wait first till he sends for me.\" Lady Margaret swept past her, murmuring, \"Most peculiar!\" Mary sat down again. In about an hour, Mewks came and said his master wanted her. He was very ill, and could not talk, but he would not let her go. He made her sit where he could see her, and now and then stretched out his hand to her. Even in his pain he showed a quieter spirit. \"Something may be working--who can tell!\" thought Mary. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when at length he sought further conversation. \"I have been thinking, Mary,\" he said, \"that if I do wake up in hell when I die, no matter how much I deserve it, nobody will be the better for it, and I shall be all the worse.\" He spoke with coolness, but it was by a powerful effort: he had waked from a frightful dream, drenched from head to foot. Coward? No. He had reason to fear. \"Whereas,\" rejoined Mary, taking up his clew, \"everybody will be the better if you...", "...of a cricket ball. With the perversity of rolling things it dribbled along the broken ground and dropped at last into a mossy pit half filled with dead leaves which marked where a gale had once torn up a young tree by the roots; and the next moment she heard, not distantly, the open-mouthed howl that comes from a cricket-field in a moment of crisis. Then she remembered that it was a habit of the young bloods of Roothing to evade their elders' feeling about Sabbath observance by going <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to an overlooked wedge of ground that ran into the woods and playing some sort of bat-and-ball game. This must be Sunday. If she did not go home at once she would begin to meet the village lovers, who would not understand how well she wished them, and would look at her with the hostility that the lucky feel for the unlucky. But when she turned to follow the homeward path she heard from all over the wood scattered shouts. The lads were looking for their ball. One she...", "...ringleader of my assailants who had moved to baptize me by immersion in the icy waters of the harbor, himself, while fishing, fell through a hole in the ice and was drowned.

At the close of the first session of the last day, I threw a football to my enemies, who, not suspecting my trick, rushed off, kicking it down the street, and when they returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to take vengeance upon me for my unprecedented rule over them, I was in the \"hub of the universe.\" I afterwards learned that my discretion was the better part of valor, for my ferocious pupils had the determination and the necessary force to send me unshriven to Davy Jones' locker.

In this document \"Sometub\" was put down as a motor-propelled craft of one ton net register and stipulated that it should proceed at a speed not exceeding four miles an hour. The waybill cost $5.10. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we were informed that a deputy collector of the port, who lived \"down the canal beyond the bridge,\" would hand us our waybill as we passed. Simultaneously with this good news the rain ceased and the sun came out in radiant glory. In two minutes we were away and broke the speed limit with the impunity of a motor driver who knows that if he does not exceed the legal speed his machine will stop altogether. We made a dash for the waybill. \"Pshaw!\" exclaimed the collector....", "...joins the English party.\" Fraulein's voice had thickened and grown caressing. Perhaps no one was in trouble. Ulrica bowed. Her wide-open startled eyes and the outline of her pale face remained unchanged. Still gentle and tender-voiced Fraulein reached Judy and the Germans. All was well. Soaps and sponges could go in the English bags. Judy's downcast crimson face began to recover its normal clear flush, and the Germans joined in the general rejoicing. They were to go, Miriam gathered, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to the baths.... She had never been to a public baths.... She wished Fraulein could know there were two bathrooms in the house at Barnes, and then wondered whether in German baths one was left to oneself or whether there, too, there would be some woman superintending. Fraulein jested softly on about her children and their bath. Gertrude and Jimmie recalled incidents of former bathings--the stories went on until breakfast had prolonged itself into a sitting of happy...", "...badly about leaving the poor old Comet in his stable all day,\" observed Billie, who had taken a long rest after her adventure in the water that morning and was enjoying a trip in the Firefly, Mr. Donahue's motor-boat. \"He will be wondering why you brought him down if you use his rival the very first afternoon,\" said Elinor. They were skimming over the blue water of Lake Worth, which was dotted with every kind of pleasure craft imaginable. The shores of Palm Beach shimmered gold <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sunshine and across the lake came the faint sound of music from the band in the Grove. \"Any kind of machine is glad to take a rest, my dear, human or otherwise,\" put in Miss Campbell. \"No doubt the Comet is well pleased to stop whirring and whirling for awhile and stay quietly in the garage.\" \"You see how real our motor car is to us,\" said Billie to Edward, who was running the boat. \"We feel toward him just as we should toward any faithful animal, a horse or a...", "...and vagaries. The young man who is to learn how to cut the fossils (after we have learnt ourselves and can teach him) is very quaint in his personal appearance, and reminds me constantly of the Golliwog, his hair grows so far down his neck and the back of his head is so flat.

We had expected that the train would be along late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the previous day, and as the morning wore away we were somewhat anxious and uneasy at its nonarrival. At last, about ten o'clock, we began to hear in the distance the loud and sharp reports of the big bull-whips, which were handled with great dexterity by the teamsters, and cracked like rifle shots.

About four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they should be led out again to fresh and moist pastures. This care pursued for two or three months is sufficient to make them fleshy and fat; but this fat, which originates from the great quantities of water drank by the animal, is only a kind of pursy swelling, and would soon occasion the rot; it is therefore necessary to kill them immediately when they acquire this false fat: even their flesh, instead of having become firm and juicy, is frequently the more flat and...", "...in every continent.

She feigned an extremity of vindictiveness, and twisted her brows in comic apology for the unfeminine sentiment, as she said: 'I really do.' The feminine gentleness of her character was known to Stukely, so she could afford to exaggerate the expression of her anger, and she did not modify it, forgetful that a woman is the representative of the sex with cynical men, and escapes from contempt at the cost of her sisterhood. Looking out of an upper window <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> she beheld Nevil Beauchamp in a group with his uncle Everard, the colonel and Cecilia, and Mr. Culbrett. Nevil was on his feet; the others were seated under the great tulip-tree on the lawn. A little observation of them warned her that something was wrong. There was a vacant chair; Nevil took it in his hand at times, stamped it to the ground, walked away and sharply back fronting his uncle, speaking vehemently, she perceived, and vainly, as she judged by the cast of...", "...received us with great cordiality.

After we had made the chief and his friends the necessary presents, we went on board with a hog, and some fruit, received from him in return; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he gave me another hog, still larger, without asking for the least acknowledgment. Exchanges for fruit, &c. were mostly carried on alongside the ships. I attempted to trade for these articles on shore, but did not succeed, as the most of them were brought in canoes from distant parts, and carried directly to the ships.

At the first warning of the Union advance, General Branch had formed his troops facing the east and southeast, and covering the Ashcake road, which runs in a sort of semicircle from the Hanover road to Ashland on the west, so that the attack of the Union forces against the main body of rebels merely forced them to give ground in the direction of Ashland. Lane, at Taliaferro's Mill, was left to work his way out, which he did later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> with considerable loss. Now, when the fight opened, the most of Branch's brigade--having moved somewhat forward--had placed itself between me and our troops. I soon became aware of this fact by seeing straggling Confederate soldiers in the woods in several directions; some of them seemed to be wounded. Half a mile or so to the eastward the battle was loud. By this time it was a little after noon; the sun was hot. The sounds of battle were advancing toward the...", "...one year's floes, tremendously screwed and doubtless including old floes in their mass, have now enormously increased in area.

The stratified surface had clearly faulted. I suggest that an uneven bottom to such a berg giving unequal buoyancy to parts causes this faulting. The second berg was domed, having a twin peak. These bergs are still a puzzle. I rather cling to my original idea that they become domed when stranded and isolated. These two bergs had left long tracks of open water in the pack.

Encouraged by this delay, the enemy at five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> took the offensive and advanced through some cornfields lying between the two armies and attacked Ewell's division on the Confederate right; while shortly afterward they fell with overwhelming strength on Jackson's left, and, attacking it in front, flank, and rear, drove it back, and pressed upon it with such force that the day appeared lost.

The curate began to cough; four fits of coughing one morning between the Litany and the Epistle, and five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> service. Here was a discovery--the curate was consumptive. How interestingly melancholy! If the young ladies were energetic before, their sympathy and solicitude now knew no bounds. Such a man as the curate--such a dear--such a perfect love--to be consumptive! It was too much.

As they were about to leave the waiter quietly told Brillat-Savarin that the Jamaicans had ordered a good dinner and had given directions that the wine and liquor be carefully prepared, because they regarded the invitation as a challenge or test of drinking powers, and that the man with the big mouth had said that he hoped to put the Frenchmen under the table.

It was nothing but a roof on poles, but it was a welcome sight to us as it meant rest and food.

Lest there be a misunderstanding, it should be said here that this was the second day after the battle of Welsh's Butte, as it came to be known. The first day the punchers had been busy burying the dead and attending to the numerous things to which such an occasion gives rise. It was on the morning of this day that Stelton, giving as an excuse his urgent desire to return to the Bar T, had ridden away, commanding his cowboys to remain and do their portion of the work. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he had met Smithy Caldwell in a secret place, and given him a note to the leader of the band of rustlers. This Caldwell, with his usual tricky foresight, did not deliver, giving the message by word of mouth, and keeping the piece of paper as evidence in case Stelton should turn against him.

Never having heard of such a thing I accepted the invitation. Securing a couple of shovels we cleared a path to the knoll; and, on the way, Mr. Hosmer explained that Angus Cameron, another new pupil, hailing from Canada, had brought to the school a toboggan, a kind of sled, and we were to make a smooth path or slide for it, so the boys and girls could try it <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when there were no lessons. We went to work with a will, spanking the snow down with the shovels, leveling uneven places and forming a clear, hard track from the top of the Knoll to the brook. On the edge of the bank we piled up an inclined plane, wetting down the snow and building a mound perhaps five feet high. From this elevation, Mr. Hosmer stated, the toboggan, flying down the slide, would shoot upward and forward and land on the far side of the brook. That...", "...Dick shivered, stamped his feet violently, and went on painfully breaking his way through the snow. He began to have that dull stupor of mind and body again.

He was amused at the thought of the Sioux coming. There were hidden away somewhere in some snug valley, and were too sensible to venture upon the plain. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the wind became so fierce, and Dick was so tired, that he dug a hole in the deepest snow bank he could find, wrapped the blankets tightly around him, and crouched there for warmth and shelter.

He took off his shoes and leggings inside the shelter of his blankets, and chafed feet and legs with vigorous hands. This restored warmth and circulation, but he was compelled...", "...said. \"I do not want to be released.\" \"You do not want to be released,\" she repeated. \"No,\" he said. \"They can exchange me.

The British, who had so far been spared in the recent German offensive, had a small victory to their credit on the same day (July 19, 1918) that the French, Americans, and Italians were pushing back the enemy all along the front. Meteren, a valuable observation point in the Bailleul sector, was captured by Scottish and Australian troops. Four hundred Germans were taken and a number of machine guns. Heavy fighting was resumed late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of July 19, 1918, along the Aisne-Marne front. The French were fighting uphill, but the Germans could not keep them back, and were slowly pushed out of their strongest positions in this region. The large numbers of fresh troops thrown into the battle to support the crown prince made it necessary for the French to fight every foot of the way. On a twenty-eight-mile front the average advance of the Allies was only one mile, and they fought hard from noon on July 19,...", "...know whether I would go with him to White Hall to-day, I rose but could not get ready before he was gone, but however I walked thither and heard Dr. King, Bishop of Chichester, make a good and eloquent sermon upon these words, \"They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.\" Thence (the chappell in Lent being hung with black, and no anthem sung after sermon, as at other times), to my Lord Sandwich at Sir W.

At length two Portuguese boats came off to help tow us in; and about three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we came to an anchor and took the prospect of the town.

After breakfast, it leaked out, through the officers, that if we would get through our work soon, we might have a boat <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and go fishing. This bait was well thrown, and took with several who were fond of fishing; and all began to find that as we had one thing to do, and were not to be kept at work for the day, the sooner we did it, the better. Accordingly, things took a new aspect; and before two o'clock this work, which was in a fair way to last two days, was done; and five of us went a fishing in the jolly-boat, in the direction of Point Pinos; but leave to go ashore was refused....", "...But never a sign of disturbance did the passing time bring forth. At last, with the coming of the business day, the Sergeant sought out the principal men of the place, and from them ascertained the truth. Threats of a jail delivery there had been, and a noisy parade as well, but nothing had occurred or promised beyond the power of an active local officer to handle. Such was the statement of one and all. \"I'll just make sure,\" said the Sergeant to himself. Till two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the detail continued its patrols.

Now if Hilderman should by any tactless remark betray our strange experience <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> there would be the devil to pay. I followed the General into the library, beckoning to the American with a warning finger on my lip. He saw at once what I meant, fortunately, and held his tongue, and we all talked of general matters for some little time. Then Hilderman took the bull by the horns. \"As a matter of fact, General,\" he announced boldly, \"I ran over to have a word with Mr. Ewart about a certain matter which is interesting us all.

Save for a rather sloppy passage of the main ford, the journey was without incident.

The seventeen miles to Invermere we covered in a leisurely fashion, reaching the hotel at three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the following day, Sunday, the twentieth of September. Here I found a wire from Chester, stating that it had finally proved impossible for him to get away from business, and asking me to go ahead and see the Big Bend trip through without him.

Mrs. Evans and Vic had to shake hands with them next, and then rode away with Cal towards Santa Lucia, while Sam and the wild-looking scouts set out for an examination of all the traces left behind by Kah-go-mish and his warriors. \"The two bands, Chiricahuas and Mescaleros, are almost like different tribes,\" was the explanation Vic received from her mother. CHAPTER IX. THE HACIENDA OF SANTA LUCIA. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the fourth day after the red mustang and the regular-army black brought Cal home to Santa Lucia, the ranch wore a very peaceful appearance. No cavalry were camped near it. There was not now any American flag floating from the staff on the roof of the hacienda, and there was not wind enough to have made one float if it had been there. No cattle were grazing within sight of anybody standing at the stockade gate. That was closed and barred in an unusually...", "...the wind to change even never so little. Yet such was the suddenness many times, although the masters of the ships were very careful and diligent, that it could hardly be done in time. From the 20th of May till the 21st of June, we lay mostly becalmed, or with contrary winds at south; and, standing to and again to bear up against this contrary wind, we got with much ado to 2 deg. N. where we espied a ship, to which the general gave chace, commanding all the ships to follow him. By two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we got up with and took her. She was of Viana, in Portugal, and came from Lisbon, in company of two caraks and three galleons, bound for the East Indies, but had parted from them at sea. The three galleons were ships of war, intended to keep the coast of India from being traded with by other nations. From this ship we took 146 butts of wine, 176 jars and 12 casks of oil, and 55 hogsheads and vats of meal,[102] which were of great service to us afterwards during our...", "...the Rogrons'. Pierrette's cries had been faintly heard, though they were soon over. No one had risen to inquire what they meant, but every one said the next day, \"Did you hear those screams about one in the morning?\" Gossip and comments soon magnified the horrible drama, and a crowd collected in front of Frappier's shop, asking the worthy cabinet-maker for information, and hearing from him how Pierrette was brought to his house with her fingers broken and the hand bloody. Towards one <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the post-chaise of Doctor Bianchon, who was accompanied by Brigaut, stopped before the house, and Madame Frappier went at once to summon Monsieur Martener and the surgeon in charge of the hospital. Thus the gossip of the town received confirmation. The Rogrons were declared to have ill-used their cousin deliberately, and to have come near killing her. Vinet heard the news while attending to his business in the law courts; he left everything and hurried to the Rogrons....", "...wind of that one. An' blamed if it ain't stopped raining. Come on.\" They clambered up the slippery, muddy bank to where they had left their horses, and cantered back over their trail. Minute after minute passed before the cautious skulker among the rocks across the stream could believe in his good fortune. When he at last decided that he was alone again he left his shelter and started away, with slowly weakening stride, over cleanly washed rock where he left no trail. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> before the two irate punchers appeared upon the scene, and their comments, as they hunted slowly over the hard ground, were numerous and bitter. Deciding that it was hopeless in that vicinity, they began casting in great circles on the chance of crossing the trail further back from the river. But they had little faith in their success. As Red remarked, snorting like a horse in his disgust, \"I'll bet four dollars an' a match he's swum down th' river just to have th'...", "...of the atrocious disposition of Rokoff that they had grown to hold him in mortal terror, and now that they knew he was close upon them their timid hearts would fortify them no longer, and as quickly as possible they deserted the three whites.

Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> they realized that they had failed. Close behind them they heard the noise of a large safari advancing along the trail which they had cleared for their pursuers. When it became quite evident that they must be overtaken in a short time Anderssen hid Jane behind a large tree, covering her and the child with brush. \"There is a village about a mile farther on,\" he said to her. \"The Mosula told me its location before they deserted us.

After the men had retired, the mastiff selected out the animal which had trod upon him, and, no doubt, would have put an end to his existence, had not the carters, who were at hand, hearing an unusual noise, come to his assistance. The widow of a farmer had two mastiffs, which, from their fierceness, rendered some precaution necessary in approaching the house. Their mistress was taken suddenly ill and died, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of her death the benevolent wife of the clergyman of the parish called to see if she could render any assistance. After knocking in vain at the front door, she went to the back of the house with fear and trembling. On entering the kitchen, to her dismay she saw the two dogs on the hearth. They appeared, however, to be sensible of what had taken place, for they only lifted up their heads mournfully, looked at the intruder, and resumed their former attitude. My...", "...and two or three white asters. The girl, with warm young life in her veins, and a glow of ripe colour on her cheek stooped in smiling pity and touched that central rosebud with her lips.

There was mist like a thin shroud over the face of the earth, and little sparks of light were gleaming in the cottage windows. Reynold Harding held the reins listlessly when the driver got down to open the great wrought-iron gate, and then resigned his charge as absently as he had accepted it.

At five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> we passed a large farm-house, with some corn-fields, and pretty considerable vineyards, situated beyond the plain, near the foot of some low hills, where the soil becomes worth cultivating.

People who came late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> found his tall, slender figure inclosed in a coat of precisely the right length, shape, cut. People who came earlier found him in guise more professional but no less elegant. He took a great deal of pains with his handsome hands, which many visitors pressed with cautious, admiring respect, as something a little too good to be true, as something a little too fine for this workaday world, and with his well-grown beard, which hugged his cheeks closely to make a telling...", "...first days in Baden-baden, and each morning had been awakened by a Chorale played down in the gardens of the Kurhaus, a gentle, beautiful tune, to remind them that they were in heaven.

The difficulty began yesterday afternoon by General Mabry attacking Major O'Connor and threatening to kill him. This was at the fair grounds, and O'Connor told Mabry that it was not the place to settle their difficulties. Mabry then told O'Connor he should not live. It seems that Mabry was armed and O'Connor was not. The cause of the difficulty was an old feud about the transfer of some property from Mabry to O'Connor. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> Mabry sent word to O'Connor that he would kill him on sight. This morning Major O'Connor was standing in the door of the Mechanics' National Bank, of which he was president. General Mabry and another gentleman walked down Gay Street on the opposite side from the bank. O'Connor stepped into the bank, got a shot gun, took deliberate aim at General Mabry and fired. Mabry fell dead, being shot in the left side. As he fell O'Connor fired again, the shot taking effect in...", "...after arrival was Sunday, and these Pilgrims strangers had an opportunity to refresh themselves and prepare their souls for the strenuous business ahead.

Then it took me some time to get down to work. From then on until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I would sit at my typewriter, chew my tongue, and pound away. Each night I read to my wife what I had written that day, and Mrs. White would criticise it.

It took all day to get the troops into position and distribute food and ammunition, and there was no fighting except by the skirmishers and sharpshooters. At three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the gunboats steamed slowly up stream to attack the water-batteries. Commodore Foote repeated the instructions to the commanders and crews that he made before the attack at Fort Henry,--to fire slow, take deliberate aim, and keep cool.

Very many of the earaches of young children, from two to ten years of age, are due to this disease. The pain is very likely to come on late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> or during the night, while earlier in the day the child may be free from pain.

On the 19th of October came the climax. Cornwallis surrendered with some hundreds of sailors and about seven thousand soldiers, of whom two thousand were in hospital. The terms were similar to those which the British had granted at Charleston to General Lincoln, who was now charged with carrying out the surrender. Such is the play of human fortune. At two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the British marched out between two lines, the French on the one side, the Americans on the other, the French in full dress uniform, the Americans in some cases half naked and barefoot. No civilian sightseers were admitted, and there was a respectful silence in the presence of this great humiliation to a proud army. The town itself was a dreadful spectacle with, as a French observer noted, \"big holes made by bombs, cannon balls, splinters, barely covered graves, arms...", "...and made no inquiries; just seemed to be waiting, as if there was nothing else for him to do.

He kept growing paler and weaker and more silent. Some days he did not speak more than a dozen words, but always kind and pleasant. He was just dwindling away; and when the picture was almost done a fever took hold of him.

For two hours more this same messenger, aided by Cretet and Bernier, endeavored to bend the unflinching will of Consalvi, but to no purpose. He comprehended fully the great temporal evils that must follow a rupture with France, the dangers to the peace and liberty of the Pope and the welfare of the Church; but he knew at the same time that his action would be precisely in accordance with the wishes of the Holy Father,...", "...I do not know it myself.

Then in the evenings she made the Cervins take her to theatres and various entertainments more or less reputable, for which of course David paid. It seemed to Madame Cervin, as she sat staring beside them, that her laughs never fell in with the laughs of other people. But whether she understood or no, it...", "...was, I understood, for encouraging the persons who committed this act of violence.

If Mrs Frog had known the events that lay in the womb of the next few hours, she would sooner have consented to have had her right-hand cut off than have agreed to that most reasonable request.

That something was pending was indicated by the fact that little Di sat accoutred in her hat and cloak. \"We shall have to make haste,\" said Sir Richard, rising, \"for I should not like to be late, and it is a long drive to Whitechapel.\" \"When do they begin?\" asked...", "...the horizon. Thankful that the other ship was still in sight, the merchant hurried back to his own vessel and gave chase. Luckily for him, there was a full moon that night, by which the shadowy hulk and the swaying masts of the mysterious ship could be seen. All the next day they sailed, but never an inch nearer to the other vessel did they come, though the merchant loaded his ship with all the canvas she could bear. Another night and another day found them no nearer. Finally, late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of the third day, a great storm came sailing over the edge of the sea; a blast of wind struck the merchant's ship, then a torrent of rain, and night came on just as the storm was at its height. When the daylight came again, the other ship had completely disappeared; and though the worried merchant sailed here and sailed there, never a sign of the stranger could he find. At last, with a heavy heart, he gave up the quest and returned to his King with the evil...", "...and approached the right of the National line by a course nearly perpendicular to it; but, after advancing a quarter of a mile, General Pillow said it was too late in the day to accomplish anything, and the troops returned to their quarters.

However, she assented unwillingly, and they went in to lunch. * * * * * So <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the husband and wife sallied forth. Letty felt that she was being taken through an ordeal, and that George was rather foolish to wish it. However, she did her best to be cheerful, and to please George she still wore the pretty Paris frock of the morning, though it seemed to her absurd to be trailing it through a village street with only colliers and their wives to look at it. \"What ill luck,\" said George, suddenly, as they descended their own hill, \"that that fellow...", "...and to establish a line approximately from Goudberg Copse in the north to the railway line just south of Vienna Cottages in the south.

The troops of the 49th Battalion had as their objective Furst Farm and the pill-boxes about and beyond, and the strong points to the north of Meetcheele.

It was his twenty-eighth birthday and up to two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> he was, as for the last six weeks he had been, a clerk in the great house of R. C. Royle & Sons. There was no sort of business in Chile which R. C. Royle & Sons were not prepared to undertake and carry through with efficiency, from a colossal deal in nitrates to the homeward freight of your portmanteau. It was, to be sure, upon the latter class of work that James Challoner was asked to concentrate his abilities.

After being present at his own church in the forenoon, and dining, he says: \"I went and ranged and ranged about to many churches, among the rest to the Temple, where I heard Dr. Wilkins a _little_.\" It is to be feared pretty faces and not powerful preachers often induced him to go to the house of prayer. Writing on August 11th, 1661, he says: \"To our own church in the forenoon, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> to Clerkenwell Church, only to see the two fair Botelers.\" He managed to obtain a seat where he could have a good view of them, but they did not charm him, for he says: \"I am now out of conceit with them.\" Another Sunday he writes: \"By coach to Greenwich Church, where a good sermon, a fine church, and a good company of handsome women.\" At another church he visited he says that his pretty black girl was present. Pepys has much to say about the sermons he heard, and...", "...and so get a general idea of my inheritance. And indeed it was a glorious one; insensibly a new and stimulating ichor entered into my veins; this was my own country, the chosen home of my forebears: this gracious and beautiful land was part of myself; deep down in its generous bosom went the essential roots of my being, and I thrilled with the consciousness of a new life, a life far more satisfying and abundant than I had ever known before; I was Hildebrand of the \"Hundred.\" Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I returned, and ran upstairs to freshen my appearance before joining the ladies for a cup of tea on the library terrace. As I passed the sick room I heard the sounds of a violent altercation, and I recognized the voices as belonging to Eunice Trevor and John Thaneford; how indecent for them to be quarrelling in the presence of a man actually moribund! I had no taste for more eavesdropping, but the door was partially ajar, and I could not help overhearing one...", "...each other. They were all fond of Phil, and accordingly fraternized at once with his new friend, adopting him into their circle with the ease of manner and freedom of sentiment which seemed the characteristic of their class; and they took to him all the more kindly because, amateur though he was, he shared many of their enthusiasms. Of course he did not always see Dolly when he went. During every other day of the week but Saturday she spent her time from nine in the morning until five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> in the rather depressing atmosphere of the Bilberry school-room. She vigorously assaulted the foundations of Lindley Murray, and attacked the rules of arithmetic; she taught Phemie French, and made despairing but continuous efforts at \"finishing\" her in music. But poor Phemie was not easily \"finished,\" and hung somewhat heavily upon the hands of her youthful instructress; still, she was affectionate, if weak-minded, and so Dolly managed to retain her good spirits....", "...fried,\" was the inexorable answer. \"How many?\" Le Mire turned to me, and I explained. Then she turned again to the surly host with a smile that must have caused him to regret his gruffness. \"Well, then, fr-r-ied!\" said she, rolling the \"r\" deliciously. \"And you may bring me five, if you please.\" It appeared that I was not the only hungry one. We ate leisurely and smoked more leisurely still, and started on our return journey a little before eight o'clock. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> when we arrived at the Antlers. The trip was accomplished without accident, but Le Mire was thoroughly exhausted and Harry was anything but fresh. That is the worst of mountain climbing: the exaltation at the summit hardly pays you for the reaction at the foot. We entered the broad portico with frank sighs of relief. I said something about joining them at dinner and left for my own rooms. At dinner that evening Harry was in high spirits and took great delight in...", "...section being thus constituted, we then appointed our own _vice_-president, reporter, and secretary; they were unanimously elected; the first was my old friend, Robert Fleury; the second was Emile de Savelege, the Belgian writer whom you know of; and the third an old and kind friend of mine, Maurice Cottier, a man much mixed up in the official artistic world and possessing a magnificent picture gallery. To-morrow we begin our labours at the Exhibition, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> I shall go to the _seance_ of the _Institut_, which always takes place on Saturdays. This is my budget. Perhaps the most important work inside the Academy which Leighton effected during this time was that of establishing the winter exhibitions of Old Masters at Burlington House. No one exemplified practically better than did Leighton the value of the motto, \"What is worth having is worth sharing.\" He had been fed from early youth from the fountain-heads of...", "...usual, had placed a tumbler with some brandy in it on the table, and beside it lay the soda. The purser took off his clothes, and got into his thinnest pyjamas, for the cabin was close; but he had made up his mind to stay in his cabin that night, for the sole reason that he was now very suspicious of Captain Forreste and his party, and had made up his mind to suffer the discomfort of a hot cabin, and the noise of the coaling going on as long as they were on board. Forreste had told him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> that he and his party were staying at Cooktown, much to his satisfaction. Eight bells struck, and then noise of the falling coals suddenly ceased--the lumpers were taking the usual half-hour \"spell.\" Adlam opened the soda, and the listening Swires heard the pop of the cork, and stole softly into No. 16, where he found the gang awaiting him. \"Well, he's taken his B and S,\" he said, \"and that finishes my part of the contract.\" (Earlier in the evening he and Pinkerton...", "...along the Mattapony River, holding the crossings. On the right was Wright; close to him at the left, Warren; in the center, Burnside; on the left, Hancock. Our headquarters were at New Bethel Church. Our talk that night was that in all probability we should meet the enemy on the North Anna, a day's march to the south of our position. The operations of the next day were much embarrassed by our ignorance of the road and the entire incorrectness of our maps; nevertheless, by one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> our right wing, under Warren, reached the North Anna. The stream there was about one hundred and fifty feet wide, with bluff banks from fifty to seventy-five feet high. Wright followed after Warren. As soon as Warren reached Jericho Mills he pushed his sharpshooters across the stream, which was easily fordable at that place, following them with a compact body of infantry.

There are foreboding signs in the sea, that I would wish to study.\" * * * * * Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> of that day, Captain Lufflin, coming up the rocks from the beach, (for he had spent the day measuring the advancing tide,) saw a queer-shaped cart or van drive up to the side door, and a woman with divers bundles alight and go in. About an hour after, Madame Jacobus came out to him, a woollen shawl over her head, and stood beside the garden-fence with him, pulling the heads off the dead hollyhock-stalks as she talked. \"I've a story to tell you,\" she said, her voice...", "...was a little too high. This day I begun to make use of the silver pen (Mr. Coventry did give me) in writing of this sermon, taking only the heads of it in Latin, which I shall, I think, continue to do. So home and at my office reading my vowes, and so to Sir W.

Among other things talked of young Dawes that married the great fortune, who it seems has a Baronet's patent given him, and is now...", "...arrested, accused of furnishing the W. S. P.

While this was being done another party of police, armed with a special warrant, proceeded to the printing office where our paper, _The Suffragette_, was published. The printer, Mr. Drew, was placed under arrest and the material for the paper, which was to appear on the following day, was seized. By one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> the entire plant and the headquarters of the Union were in the hands of the police, and to all appearances the militant movement--temporarily at least--was brought to a full stop. In my state of semi-prostration it at first seemed to me best to let the week's issue of the paper lapse, but on second thought I decided that even the appearance of surrender was not to be thought of.

It was a fine spring day, and it was pleasant to glide through the open country all quickening into green. He arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> at the little wayside station. It was in the south-east corner of Somersetshire, and Howard liked the look of the landscape, the steep green downs, with their wooded dingles breaking down into rich undulating plains, dappled with hedgerow trees and traversed by gliding streams. He was met at the station by an old-fashioned waggonette, with an elderly coachman, who said that Mrs. Graves had hoped to come herself, but was not very well, and thought that Mr. Kennedy would...", "...Germans like veterans. The first big attack of the Germans launched directly against an American line occurred on April 30, in the vicinity of Villers-Bretonneaux, below the Somme, where the Huns were repulsed with heavy losses.

AMERICANS BOMBARDED. The German bombardment opened at 5 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> and was directed especially against the Americans, who were supported on the north and south by the French. The fire was intense and at the end of two hours the German commander sent forward three battalions of infantry. There was hand-to-hand fighting all along the line, as a result of which the enemy was thrust back, his dead and wounded lying on the ground in all directions. Five prisoners remained in American hands. \"Tell them back home that we are just...", "...at the long line of steps behind to convince me that we had in fact made any progress. The action of resting one's whole weight on one leg for about a minute, and then slowly transferring it to the other, becomes wearisome when protracted for hours.

I was in constant suspense lest Lauener should pronounce for a retreat, which would have been not merely humiliating, but not improbably dangerous, amidst the crumbling _seracs_ <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> sun. I listened with some amusement to the low moanings of little Charlet, who was apparently bewailing his position to Croz, and being heartless chaffed in return.

Certain facts, which must have been noted by all the great voyagers of the world, might give me data from which to establish the suspected conclusion.

Four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the afternoon</span> found me too tired to apply any process of analysis to the observations obtained. I therefore retired to my accustomed seat, took down almost the first book which came to hand, and resigned myself to the impressions of a favorite author.

On the afternoon of the day on which Concetta had walked to the grocer's shop, Ippolito strolled up to the small church as usual.
