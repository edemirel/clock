We must encourage men to venture, to take chances; only so can the great evils that ride mankind be banished.

If a tenant transfers his entire interest in the lease, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a sale, and is usually called an _assignment_.

Yet, occasionally, an artist has appeared, making Rome or Florence his home long enough to win a place, which, when he has departed, is not quickly filled, who has ideas of history and events calling for the record of the palette; or there has been wrought in the studio of some resident painter a composition in which landscape has been employed as accessory. In many instances there have been produced works which reflect the highest honor upon our country. As <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> foreign to the purpose of the present paper to deal with other than the different phases of landscape-painting, we forbear to speak as their merits suggest of the figure portions of the works of Mr. Rothermel, the result of his brief sojourn in Italy. In any passage of scenery, and particularly in sky forms and tones, the expression and character are always such as support vigorously the action of his group. We say vigorously; for Mr. Rothermel, in his Italian pictures, revealed...", "...ICH. \"'Your Majesty, the winter-crop was somewhat frost-nipt; but the summer-crop in return is so abundant it will richly make up for the winter-crop.'

In Thibet, the eldest male of a family shares his wife with his brothers, the whole family live in the bride's house and the children inherit from her.

In this poem Browning represents facts as they are; it is not simply that the man wants to go out and live among other men, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a natural law that he must, as truly a natural law as gravitation.

He further defines the only source of the ridiculous to be affectation, of which the chief causes are vanity and hypocrisy. Whether this scheme was an after-thought it is difficult to say; but it is certainly necessary to a proper understanding of the author's method--a method which was to find so many imitators. Another passage in the Preface is worthy of remark. With reference to the pictures of vice which the book contains, he observes: \"First, That <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> very difficult to pursue a Series of human Actions, and keep clear from them. Secondly, That the Vices to be found here [i.e. in _Joseph Andrews_] are rather the accidental Consequences of some human Frailty, or Foible, than Causes habitually existing in the Mind.

When I think over that list and seriously ask myself three questions, I have to answer each with _No_:--Are there any qualities in the list which I can afford to spare, to go without, as mere show-qualities? Not one. Can I get...", "...woman over savage man. The momentous change was not, indeed, the result of any higher spiritual quality in the female, nor was it a religious movement, as is the beautiful dream of Bachofen. I do not think we can credit \"a movement\" as having taken place at all, rather the change arose gradually, inevitably, and quite simply. To postulate a conscious movement towards progress organised by women is surely absurd. Human nature does not start on any new line of conduct voluntarily, rather <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> forced into it in connection with the conditions of life. Just as savage man was driven into unsocial conduct, so, as I shall try to show, savage woman was led by the same conditions acting in an opposite direction, into social conduct. My own thought was drawn first to this conclusion by noting the behaviour of a band of female turkeys with their young. It was a year ago. I was staying in a Sussex village, and near by my home was the meadow of a farm in which families of young...", "...regard to other States because it is bound not to intervene in the affairs of other States. And it is generally admitted that a State can through conventions, such as a treaty of alliance or neutrality and the like, enter into many obligations which hamper it more or less in the management of its international affairs. Independence is a question of degree, and it is therefore also a question of degree whether the independence of a State is destroyed or not by certain restrictions. Thus <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> generally admitted that States under suzerainty or under protectorate are so much restricted that they are not fully independent, but half-Sovereign. And the same is the case with the member-States of a Federal State which are part-Sovereign. On the other hand, the restriction connected with the neutralisation of States does not, according to the correct opinion,[198] destroy their independence, although they cannot make war except in self-defence, cannot conclude alliances, and...", "...Lear. Two days after my long conversation with Tyrrell, I called again upon that worthy. To my great surprise he had left Cheltenham. I then strolled to Vincent: I found him lolling on his sofa, surrounded, as usual, with books and papers. \"Come in, Pelham,\" said he, as I hesitated at the threshold--\"come in. I have been delighting myself with Plato all the morning; I scarcely know what it is that enchants us so much with the ancients. I rather believe, with Schlegel, that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> that air of perfect repose--the stillness of a deep soul, which rests over their writings. Whatever would appear common- place amongst us, has with them I know not what of sublimity and pathos. Triteness seems the profundity of truth--wildness the daring of a luxuriant imagination. The fact is, that in spite of every fault, you see through all the traces of original thought; there is a contemplative grandeur in their sentiments, which seems to have nothing borrowed in its meaning...", "...place.\" It was not trusting to balls and parties, to dinners and routs, but to all kinds of fun and devilment besides. All the members of Parliament used to be skylarking about the city, playing tricks on one another, and humbugging the Castle people.

Hasn't the duke all the privy council and the bishops as often to dinner as the garrison and the bar? Isn't he obliged to go to his own apartment when they want to make a night of it, and sing a good chorus? Don't tell me! Sure, even as late as Lord Westmorland's time it was another thing--pleasant and happy times they were, and the country will never be the same till we have them back again!'

In this fundamental form there must be no doubt as to the nature of the relations that obtain between the concrete concepts. We must know what concrete concept is directly or indirectly related to what other, and how. If we wish to talk of a thing and an action, we must know if they are cooerdinately related to each other (e.g., \"He is fond of _wine and gambling_\"); or if the thing is conceived of as the starting point, the \"doer\" of the action, or, as <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> customary to say, the \"subject\" of which the action is predicated; or if, on the contrary, it is the end point, the \"object\" of the action. If I wish to communicate an intelligible idea about a farmer, a duckling, and the act of killing, it is not enough to state the linguistic symbols for these concrete ideas in any order, higgledy-piggledy, trusting that the hearer may construct some kind of a relational pattern out of the general probabilities of the case. The fundamental...", "...that most people said their prayers, and many people prayed. I have lived to think differently. I have come to the conclusion that the great majority of professing Christians do not pray at all. I know this sounds very shocking, and will startle many. But I am satisfied that prayer is just one of those things which is thought a \"matter of course,\" and, like many matters of course, is shamefully neglected. It is \"everybody's business;\" and, as it often happens in such cases, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a business carried on by very few. It is one of those private transactions between God and our souls which no eye sees, and therefore one which there is every temptation to pass over and leave undone. I believe that thousands _never say a word of prayer at all_. They eat; they drink; they sleep; they rise; they go forth to their labour; they return to their homes; they breathe God's air; they see God's sun; they walk on God's earth; they enjoy God's mercies; they have dying...", "...iron, or character,--this is success. Raising common \"stuff\" to priceless value is great success. The man who first takes the rough bar of wrought iron may be a blacksmith, who has only partly learned his trade, and has no ambition to rise above his anvil. He thinks that the best possible thing he can do with his bar is to make it into horseshoes, and congratulates himself upon his success. He reasons that the rough lump of iron is worth only two or three cents a pound, and that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not worth while to spend much time or labor on it. His enormous muscles and small skill have raised the value of the iron from one dollar, perhaps, to ten dollars. Along comes a cutler, with a little better education, a little more ambition, a little finer perception, and says to the blacksmith: \"Is this all you can see in that iron? Give me a bar, and I will show you what brains and skill and hard work can make of it.\" He sees a little further into the rough bar. He has...", "...plants, and distributed them into twenty-two classes, chiefly according to the form of the corolla, distinguishing herbs and under-shrubs on the one hand from trees and shrubs on the other. The system of Tournefort was for a long time adopted on the continent, but was ultimately displaced by that of Carl von Linne, or Linnaeus (q.v.; 1707-1778). The system of Linnaeus was founded on characters derived from the stamens and pistils, the so-called sexual organs of the flower, and hence <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> often called the sexual system. It is an artificial method, because it takes into account only a few marked characters in plants, and does not propose to unite them by natural affinities. It is an index to a department of the book of nature, and as such is useful to the student. It does not aspire to any higher character, and although it cannot be looked upon as a scientific and natural arrangement, still it has a certain facility of application which at once commended it.

Sugar, or sugar candy, has been made in China from very remote antiquity, and large quantities have been exported from India, in all ages, whence <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> most probable that it found its way to Rome. The principal impurities to be sought for in cane sugar are inorganic matter, water, molasses, farina, and grape, or starch sugar. The latter substance is occasionally, for adulterating purposes, added in Europe to cane sugar; it may be detected by the action of concentrated sulphuric acid and of a solution of caustic potassa; the former blackens cane sugar, but does not affect the starch sugar, while potassa darkens the color of...", "...or of Latin can the Emperor have got hold of? At the same time he had got a fair notion of the general position of Cattaro, though he runs off into bits of exaggeration which remind us of Giraldus' description of Llanthony.

There certainly is no place where <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> harder to believe that the smooth waters of the narrow, lake-like inlet, with mountains on each side which it seems as if one could put out one's hand and touch, are really part of the same sea which dashes against the rocks of Ragusa.

But other geometries exist, for <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> possible to frame systems of axioms which definitely characterize some other kind of space, and from these axioms to deduce a series of non-contradictory propositions; such geometries are called non-Euclidean.

This is the surest way of avoiding a possible miscarriage of the plan. The failure of one of the forty men will not then involve the remaining thirty-nine. Every contingency is weighed.

Myron is doubtless right in stating that the Helots could not lay aside this dress at pleasure; indeed, a young Spartan could not assume the dress of an older man. Whilst in Athens the influence of democracy had produced an uniformity of dress, and even (according to Xenophon)(144) of bodily form, in citizens, resident aliens, and slaves; in Sparta the several orders were characterised by external differences. Now since Myron thus manifestly misinterpreted this circumstance, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> very probable that his other objections are founded in error; nor can misrepresentations of this political state, which was unknown to the later Greeks, and particularly to the class of writers, have been uncommon.

Ghiberti's gift for composition, as well as his failure to understand, or at least to satisfy the more fundamental needs of his art, may be seen very happily in those two panels now in the Bargello, which he and Brunellesco made in the competition for the gates of the Baptistery. Looking on those two panels, where both artists have carved the Sacrifice of Isaac, you see Ghiberti at his best, the whole interest not divided, as <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> in Brunellesco's panel, between the servants and the sacrifice, but concentrated altogether upon that scene which is about to become so tragical. Yet with what energy Brunellesco has conceived an act that in his hands seems really to have happened.

To such persons the beauty of Greek art will ever seem wanting, because its supreme beauty is rather male than female.\" To this I think we ought to add that, while <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> true that \"the supreme beauty of Greek art is rather male than female,\" this is due not so much to any passion of the Greeks for male beauty as to the fact that the male body exhibits a higher organisation of the human form than the female.

To many, all this will seem a pedantic taking note of commonplaces,--as if it were worth while remarking that the existing governments are vested with the indispensable attributes of government. Yet history records an instance at variance with this axiomatic rule, a rule which is held to be an unavoidable deliverance of common sense. And <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> by no means an altogether unique instance. It may serve to show that these characteristic and unimpeachable powers that invest all current governmental establishments are, after all, to be rated as the marks of a particular species of governments, and not characteristics of the genus of governmental establishments at large. These powers answer to an acquired bias, not to an underlying trait of human nature; a matter of habit, not of heredity.

Your top does not rise merely because it spins, but because it wabbles as it spins--wabbling being the familiar word for what the machinist calls \"precession.\" A freely spinning top, if in equilibrium, has no inherency to rise up against gravitation, as your top may have led you to suppose. Your top rises because it is not spinning freely in equilibrium, its action being interfered with by the friction of the point on which it rests; <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> seeking a position of equilibrium, which, owing to the location of its centre of gravity, will be found when its spindle is erect.

On the other hand, it was said that while the justices have nominally the power of refusing the renewal of old licences, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a strictly limited power that they never put into force except for wrong-doing on the part of the licensees; and that the custom has so long prevailed of regularly renewing the certificates of all publicans who behave properly, that an expectation of renewal has become universal; and that by virtue of custom they have a vested interest, and are entitled to compensation if renewal is refused.

Some very interesting experiments made by Sarasin and De la Rive (_Comptes rendus_, 115, p. 489) showed that this explanation could not be the true one, since by using detectors of different sizes they found that the distance between two consecutive places where the sparks vanished depended mainly upon the size of the detector, and very little upon that of the vibrator. With small detectors they found the distance small, with large detectors, large; in fact <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> directly proportional to the diameter of the detector.

Just a few statistics to show you how vital <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> that the eye must be kept on the ball UNTIL THE MOMENT OF STRIKING IT. About 85 per cent of the points in tennis are errors, and the remainder earned points. As the standard of play rises the percentage of errors drops until, in the average high-class tournament match, 60 per cent are errors and 40 per cent aces. Any average superior to this is super-tennis. Thus the importance of getting the ball in play cannot be too greatly emphasized.

Therefore begin with prayer that the Lord grant unto you the true understanding of His Word. Even Spencer had a glimpse of this scientific principle toward the end of his life. In his essay on \"Feeling Versus Intellect\" he showed that he had lost faith in his former estimate of the place of the intellect in the moral realm when he said: Everywhere the...", "...all the outer portions of the Empire, I should be interested in and impelled to write regarding the impingement of the outer life of our far dominions, through individual character, upon the complicated, traditional, orderly life of England.

Religion is needed as the basis of morality; and morality itself must be encouraged as the safeguard of that discipline which constitutes a nation's vigor. A moralized race is stronger than a corrupt one, because it has a higher respect for law and social order, because it accepts public burdens more cheerfully, because <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> more obedient to military ordinances. Thus both religion and morality are means to the grand end of human existence, which is strenuous life in a united nation.

Cotton-seed, without extra care in drying, has moisture enough to make it heat in bulk, by which its germinating power is greatly impaired.

When the caterpillars are full grown, they climb upon twigs placed for them and begin to spin or make the cocoon.

With a motion of the head somewhat like the figure eight, the silk worm throws this thread around the body from head to tail until at last <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> entirely enveloped. The body grows smaller and the thread grows finer until at last it has spun out most of the substance of the body and the task is done. If left to itself, when the time came, the moth would eat its way out of the cocoon and ruin the fiber.

The dust also had nearly blinded them, in spite of their masks.

Some believe that the British fauna is altogether post-glacial; a few think that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> partly so and the remainder glacial; others again hold that a portion is pre-glacial and the rest glacial and post-glacial. Those who have studied the subject most closely feel convinced that the south-western or Lusitanian fauna, and also the flora, must have arrived before the Glacial period and survived the latter in these Islands. It seems reasonable to suppose, therefore, that the climate cannot have been very severe during the so-called Ice-Age. This Lusitanian fauna must...", "...entirely from the manufactures of America.\" \"Well,\" said Miss Featherstone, \"there is one point you cannot make out,--gloves; certainly the French have the monopoly of that article.\" \"I am not going to ruin my cause by asserting too much,\" said I. \"I haven't been with nicely dressed women so many years not to speak with proper respect of Alexander's gloves,--and I confess, honestly, that to forego them must be a fair, square sacrifice to patriotism.

The case of Ireland herself has been cited. Ireland, it has been said, had an independent legislature from 1782 to 1800: during eighteen years there were two coequal parliaments under one Crown; and yet there was no collision. Sir, the reason that there was not perpetual collision was, as we all know, that the Irish parliament, though nominally independent, was generally kept in real dependence by means of the foulest corruption that ever existed in any assembly. But <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not true that there was no collision. Before the Irish legislature had been six years independent, a collision did take place, a collision such as might well have produced a civil war.

According to the constitution, the duty of making provision for the discharge of those functions devolved on the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland.

A myth is not a falsehood; it is a product of mental activity, as instructive and rich as any later product, but its characteristic is that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not yet distinguished into history, and poetry, and philosophy. It is all of these in the germ, as dream and imagination, and thought and experience, are fused in the mental furniture of a child's mind.

The main job confided to His friends is the preaching of the Gospel.

Though I have reserved this to the last of the things to be desired in a wife, I by no means think it the last in point of importance.

Her eyes, Don thought, were like great wells of darkness. As the seconds ticked past, and she did not speak, he felt a tiny shiver of doubt. Was it possible, he wondered, that the girl had already pierced his masquerade? All at once she came closer, with a low musical laugh. \"Always mysterious, aren't you, Andre?\" she said, taking both his hands. \"Every time I meet you here, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> the same! You stand looking at me so silent and grave, until I feel like a silly little girl. But in the end I always succeed in making you laugh and be silly with me, don't I, Andre?\" With some difficulty Don held his serious pose.

The subject of fasting has been fully treated of in the preceding chapter; and so <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> only necessary now to describe the other ceremonies connected with the religious observance of this month. From the earliest days of Islam this month has been held in the greatest esteem by Muslims, for it was in this month that Muhammad used to retire for meditation, year after year, to the cave of Hira, situated on a low hill some few miles distant from Mecca. In the second year of the Hijra, or flight from Mecca, it was ordained that the month of Ramazan should be kept as a...", "...the party cast, now and then, at the weapons swinging at their sides in the big holsters, it was evident that if shooting was to be a part of the game, they would be ready for it. \"Things are livening up a bit, aren't they?\" remarked Nort to Bud as the boys rode side by side. \"That's the way they ought to be,\" declared Dick. \"I hate sitting around and waiting for something to happen.\" \"We didn't have to wait very long,\" chuckled Bud. \"That's right,\" agreed Nort. \"Wonder who <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> that's been after your dad's cattle now?\" he ventured. \"Maybe some of the old gang--maybe a new one,\" replied Bud. \"You never can tell.\" \"You mean Del Pinzo's old gang?\" asked Dick. \"He's the worst of the lot--always was and always will be,\" declared Bud. \"But how does he keep out of jail?\" Nort wanted to know. \"That's one of the mysteries of it,\" went on Bud. \"We've had him sent up more than once, but he gets out again by some sort of lawyer's trick.

To judge this better, it is well to mix a little red chalk with the gum.

We make these observations in order to anticipate the objections of those reasoners who, being more influenced and guided by the local facts and by the symptoms, than by the general phenomena of comparative pathology, might argue that such or such fact is opposed to our doctrine.

According to Fontenelle,[20] theatrical representation has almost the effect of reality: but yet not altogether. We have still a certain idea of falsehood in the whole of what we see. We weep for the misfortunes of a hero to whom we are attached. In the same instant, we comfort ourselves by reflecting, that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> nothing but a fiction. The short answer to this is, that we are conscious of no such alternation as that here described. According to David Hume, whose hypothesis is a kind of supplement to the former two, that which \"when the sorrow is not softened by fiction, raises a pleasure from the bosom of uneasiness, a pleasure which still retains all the features and outward symptoms of distress and sorrow, is that very eloquence with which the melancholy scene is represented.\" In...", "...the English which we use to-day. But although Chaucer was a great poet, we know very little about his life. What we do know has nothing to do with his poems or of how he wrote them. For in those days, and for long after, a writer was not expected to live by his writing; but in return for giving to the world beautiful thoughts, beautiful songs, the King or some great noble would reward him by giving him a post at court. About this public life of Chaucer we have a few facts. But <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> difficult at times to fit the man of camp, and court, and counting-house to the poet and story-teller who possessed a wealth of words and a knowledge of how to use them greater than any Englishman who had lived before him.

These boundaries are marked out by a very fine line, which only good sense and attention can discover; <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> much too fine for vulgar eyes. In manners, this line is good-breeding; beyond it, is troublesome ceremony; short of it, is unbecoming negligence and inattention. In morals, it divides ostentatious puritanism from criminal relaxation; in religion, superstition from impiety; and, in short, every virtue from its kindred vice or weakness.

You have so often seen the sun that you begin to think <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> shining over everybody. You therefore give no longer that attention to the least action of your wife, which was impelled by your first outburst of passion.

The speaker should have a settled feeling of sufficiency; he should hold himself well together, physically and morally, avoiding nervous agitation and physical collapse; he should allow the breath freedom rather than put it under unnatural constraint. Perfect breathing can only be known by certain qualities in the voice. When it is best, the process is least observed.

It is such a concentrated food that overeating is easy, especially when <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> taken in the soft forms, such as mushes, fresh bread, griddle cakes and mashed potatoes. If people would masticate their starchy foods thoroughly it would greatly reduce the danger of overeating. It is common to eat bread three times a day and in addition to take potatoes once or twice a day. Those who consume so much starch carry into the system more food than can be used and more of the mineral salts than can be excreted. The result is the formation of deposits, chiefly of...", "...beware of hating the _person_ whilst thou abhorrest his _sin_. On the contrary, it is thy duty to bewail the case of thy neighbor, who, being carried away by so many irregular passions, enjoys no solid rest in his soul. Offer up his cause to God, and pray for him, as Christ did for his enemies, when he was nailed to the cross. Luke 23:34. Do not, therefore, hate any _man_, but hate his _vices_ only; for whosoever hates a man, and seeks his ruin, can in no wise be pleasing to God; since <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> the very nature of God to be kind, and to desire that \"all men should be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth.\" 1 Tim. 2:4. This was also the end for which Christ took our flesh upon him. He came into the world, \"not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.\" Luke 9:56. XIII. Consider all men as being frail and imperfect, but none as more frail and imperfect than thyself; for before God, all men stand equally guilty, and there is no difference. We have all sinned,...", "...Now, if I go, I go forever,--never to see Rochelle more.\" \"Nay, I hope that is not so,\" answered Edward. \"The cardinal assured me that he would give the most favorable terms to the city; and I cannot but think that your presence may be the means of rendering those terms really and not nominally favorable. You can tell him of the determination of the people, of your certain expectation of succor----\" The old man shook his head. \"No succor,\" he said; \"no succor.\" \"But at all events <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> probable,\" replied Edward, \"that you may be able to obtain terms for Rochelle which she can accept honorably.

The Greeks were acquainted with the species in the time of Homer. It is twice mentioned in the _Odyssey_ as a tree in the gardens of Phaeacia and Phrygia. They called it _roia_ or _roa_, which philologists believe to be derived from the Syrian and Hebrew name,[1190] and also _sidai_,[1191] which seems to be Pelasgic, for the modern Albanian name is _sige_.[1192] There is nothing to show that the species was wild in Greece, where Fraas and Heldreich affirm that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> now only naturalized.[1193] The pomegranate enters into the myths and religious ceremonies of the ancient Romans.[1194] Cato speaks of its properties as a vermifuge. According to Pliny,[1195] the best pomegranates came from Carthage, hence the name _Malum punicum_; but it should not be supposed, as it has been assumed, that the species came originally from Northern Africa. Very probably the Phoenicians had introduced it at Carthage long before the Romans had anything to do with...", "...as soon as it can be done conveniently. The manure from the hen-house was saved this year to use on the alfalfa fields, to see how well it would take the place of commercial fertilizer. I may as well give the result of the experiment now. It was mixed with sand and applied at the rate of eight hundred pounds an acre for the spring dressing over a portion of the alfalfa, against four hundred pounds an acre of the fertilizer 3:8:8. After two years I was convinced that, when used alone, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not of more than half the value of the fertilizer. My present practice is to use five hundred pounds of hen manure and two hundred pounds of fertilizer on each acre for the spring dressing, and two hundred pounds an acre of the fertilizer alone after each cutting except the last. We have ten or twelve tons of hen manure each year, and it is nearly all used on the alfalfa or the timothy as spring dressing. It costs nothing, and it takes off a considerable sum from the...", "...that it might have been on an evening like this that the Son of Man left the city, and with His disciples went down to Gethsemane to pray.

But if we were tired, we did not know it, and I shall always be glad of that fact. At St. Stephen's gate (the tradition is that he was stoned there) we stopped to look down on Gethsemane. Perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not the real site, and perhaps the curious gilt-turreted church is not beautiful, but set there on the hillside amid the cypresses and venerable olive-trees, all aglow and agleam with the sunset, with the shadow of the dome of Omar creeping down upon it, there was about it a beauty of unreality that was positively supernatural. I was almost tempted not to go down there for fear of spoiling the illusion.

Purpose of the Clause This clause serves a two-fold purpose: <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> the direct source of the most important powers which the National Government exercises in time of peace: and, except for the due process of law clause of Amendment XIV, it is the most important limitation imposed by the Constitution on the exercise of State power.

Of the approximately 1400 cases which reached the Supreme Court under the clause prior to...", "...exercise of this right is _revolution_--it is a declaration of independence--it is _war_, and appeals to the sword as its umpire. Let no State, then, claim to stand on the basis of the Constitution of the Union, while stripping it of its vital powers, or setting up its will for law. No, the ordinance of Carolina is not a peaceful, constitutional remedy: it is a nullification of the Government itself, sweeping away its revenues, its courts, and its officers; it is a repeal of the Union; <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> despotic; it is revolutionary; it is belligerent; it is a declaration of war or separate independence. It looks beyond a repeal of the Tariff; for, whether the Tariff be repealed or not, it asks to engraft the doctrine of nullification as a permanent feature of the Constitution, applicable in every case in which any State may deem any act of Congress unconstitutional. Then each one of the States may take up the volumes containing all the acts of Congress, and repeal them all by...", "...having shared their troubles, must needs sympathise with their sorrows. For a long time, contradictory faiths were held side by side. Christ was believed in, but Woden was still feared, and secretly appeased by sacrifices. Kings are obliged to publish edicts, forbidding their subjects to believe in the ancient divinities, whom they now term \"demons\"; but that does not prevent the monks who compile the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" from tracing back the descent of their princes to Woden: if <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not deifying, it is at least ennobling them.[70] Be your obedience qualified by reason, St. Paul had said. That of the Anglo-Saxons was not so qualified. On the contrary, they believed out of obedience, militarily.

I defy the orders of the Court of Directors, because <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> necessary for me to show that I can disregard them, as a signal of my own authority.\" He supposes his authority gone while he obeys the laws; but, says he, \"the moment I got rid of the bonds and barriers of the laws,\" (as if there had been some act of violence and usurpation that had deprived him of his rightful powers,) \"I was restored to my own authority.\" What is this authority to which he is restored?

In the preliminary sittings in the studio at home Richard's father found it necessary always to begin with some exhortation such as: \"Now, Dicky, this has _got_ to be more than just a 'Study of a Boy's Head.'

Nor is it in poetry and fiction only that such characters are found; they are scattered, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> hoped not sparingly, over real life, especially in sequestered and rural districts, where there is but small influx of new inhabitants, and little change of occupation. The spirit of the Gospel, unaided by acquisitions of profane learning and experience in the world,--that spirit and the obligations of the sacred office may, in such situations, suffice to effect most of what is needful.

It is clear, for instance, in all that has been said about forgiveness, that certain relations are presupposed as subsisting between God and man, relations which make it possible for man to sin, and possible for God, not indeed to ignore his sin, but in the very act of recognising it as all that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> to forgive it, to liberate man from it, and to restore him to Himself and righteousness. Now if the latent presuppositions of the modern mind are to any extent inconsistent with such relations, there will be something to overcome before the conceptions of forgiveness or atonement can get a hearing. These conceptions have their place in a certain view of the world as a whole, and if the mind is preoccupied with a different view, it will have an instinctive consciousness that it...", "...ait; cui sic extorta voluptas, Et demtus per vim mentis gratissimus error. HOR. Lib. ii. Ep. ii. 138. No. 85. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1759. One of the peculiarities which distinguish the present age is the multiplication of books. Every day brings new advertisements of literary undertakings, and we are flattered with repeated promises of growing wise on easier terms than our progenitors. How much either happiness or knowledge is advanced by this multitude of authors, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not very easy to decide. He that teaches us any thing which we knew not before, is undoubtedly to be reverenced as a master. He that conveys knowledge by more pleasing ways, may very properly be loved as a benefactor; and he that supplies life with innocent amusement, will be certainly caressed as a pleasing companion. But few of those who fill the world with books have any pretensions to the hope either of pleasing or instructing. They have often no other task than to lay...", "...and absolutely simple; it need not have existed, and it may cease to exist; it has, therefore, a potentiality of non-existence, which is inconceivable in the case of the Necessary and purely Actual Being; it is, therefore, mutable as regards existence; besides which the essences even of the most simple created beings, namely pure spirits are composite in the sense that they have faculties and operations really distinct from their substance. Secondly, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> alleged by some defenders of the real distinction that this latter view of the nature of existing contingent reality is a cardinal doctrine in the whole philosophical system of St. Thomas, and of scholastics generally: so fundamental, in fact, that many important doctrines, unanimously held to be true by all scholastics, cannot be successfully vindicated apart from it.(130) To which it is replied that there are no important truths of scholastic...", "...The spiritual body must also _manifest the spirit_ hereafter, as the natural or soul body now manifests the soul. For while the present body expresses adequately enough present wishes and emotions, it fails of expressing the spiritual emotions, and fails of being a true servant of the higher life. This, then, constitutes the future body. First, it is an organization connecting us with the outward universe of space and time. Second, it is identical with the present true body. Third, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a development and advance of this into a higher organization. Let us now inquire what are the evidences and proofs of _this future body_. How do we know, or why do we think, that we shall have any such body? The first proof of a future bodily existence is its reasonableness.

That it is an utterly fallacious argument must be admitted when <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> remembered that two lines at right angles make a cross--probably the earliest of all forms of decoration--and that the cross existed before its symbolism. Herein it differs from other forms of decoration (e.g. the Masonic emblems) which cannot be traced beyond their symbolical existence. The cross, like the other heraldic rectilinear figures, came into existence, meaningless as a decoration for a shield, before armory as such existed, and probably before Christianity began.

Another phase of this matter that promises to develop in the near future as a result of the vitamine hypothesis is a reform in food manufacture.

The genesis of this tendency is to be found in a highly laudable ambition to force the manufacturer to eliminate impurities and adulterations and provide clean,...", "...and yet keeping his sacred character as a being set apart from the rest of men.

In this case the molecules have become so far separated from one another that they cease to attract each other, and if left free they will soon part company, and spread themselves broadcast over the face of the earth.

The careful arrangement of the flank should be noted; part of <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> retired, with two tiers of fire, some of which is arranged to bear on the face of the bastion. The great saliency of the bastion is a weak point, but the whole arrangement is simple and strong. In the second example, known as Speckle's \"reinforced trace\" (fig. 23), we find him anticipating the work of the next century. The ravelin is here introduced, and made so large that its faces are in prolongation of those of the bastions. Speckle's other favourite ideas...", "...consequently non-eternal, there would be a loss of merits and a fruition of good and evil unmerited. As if then we had thrown their best wrestler, the redargution of the rest of their categories may be anticipated from this exposition of the manner in which their treatment of the soul has been vitiated. Their doctrine, therefore, as repugnant to the eternal, infallible revelation, cannot be adopted. The venerated Vyasa accordingly propounded the aphorism (ii. 2, 33), \"Nay, because <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> impossible in one;\" and this same aphorism has been analysed by Ramanuja with the express purpose of shutting out the doctrine of the Jainas. The tenets of Ramanuja are as follows:--Three categories are established, as soul, not-soul, and Lord; or as subject, object, and supreme disposer. Thus it has been said-- \"Lord, soul, and not-soul are the triad of principles: Hari (Vishnu) \"Is Lord; individual spirits are souls; and the visible world is...", "...how far they are justified in doing so. Because there occur in Cretaceous and Tertiary strata, within Arctic regions, certain assemblages of plants which find their nearest representatives in southern Italy and Egypt, surely it is rather rash to conclude that Greenland has experienced climates like those now characteristic of Mediterranean lands. All that the evidence really entitles us to assume is simply that the _winter temperature_ of Greenland was formerly much higher than <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> now. That great caution is required in comparing past with present climatological conditions may be seen by glancing for a moment at the character of the flora which lived in Europe during the interglacial phase of the Pleistocene period. The plants of that period are for the most part living species, so that while dealing with these we are on safer ground than when we are treating of the floras of periods so far removed from us as those of Tertiary and Cretaceous times. Now, in...", "...the year's seasons yet to be, and sees things less as they really will be than as it would choose to have them. In autumn, on the contrary, there is nothing but bare reality. If we think of spring then, the thought of winter checks us, and beneath snow and hoar-frost the chilled imagination dies.

If the sight of a man in his prime gives us like pleasure, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> when the memory of what he has done leads us to review his past life and bring up his younger days. If we think of him as he is, or as he will be in old age, the idea of declining nature destroys all our pleasure.

But when I imagine a child of ten or twelve, sound, vigorous, well developed for his age, it gives me pleasure, whether on account of the present or of...", "...Father. To the very dregs Francis drained that cup of failure and defeat, which all who are called to lead the vanguard of Christ's conquering host, have at some time or another to drink more or less deeply. That is the time when the cry, \"If it be possible, let this cup pass from me,\" is wrung from the tortured soul, and thrice happy are those who, out of an intimate knowledge of God, can add, \"Not my will, but Thine be done,\" assured that it is best simply because it is His. But <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> only those who know God and enjoy Him, who have confidence enough in Him not to demand His reasons--those whose lives have not been mere service alone--who can triumphantly and victoriously cry, \"Thy will be done.\" Such was Francis.

One sees from this that Schiller is, halting between the poetic and the scientific view of the past, uncertain which way to set his face. The poet in him is inclined to idealize the brave days of old and to mourn that the ancient giants are no more. At the same time he finds that the struggle of the Low Countries, while not 'heroic', was very remarkable, very instructive and very inspiring. From this observation <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> but a step to the recognition of the truth that it is his own conventional notion of 'heroism' that needs revising; that the giants of yore were no taller than those of to-day and that the world's supply of courage and devotion is not running low. It is an interesting fact that the sentence beginning, 'So then the strength they manifested,' was omitted by Schiller from the edition of 1801, possibly because the horrors of the Revolution had put him out of humor with fighting. But...", "...heart. Poets shed no bitterer tears than ordinary men; and Fonblanque finely showed us, in one of his late little essays, clear as wells and deep as tarns, that so far from there being anything in the constitution of genius naturally kindred either to vice or misery, it is framed of light and love and happiness, and that its sins and sufferings come not from the spirit but from the flesh. Yet is its flesh as firm as, and perhaps somewhat finer than, that of the common clay; but still <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> clay--for all men are dust. But what if they who, on the ground of genius, claim exemption from our blame, and inclusion within our sympathies, even when seen suffering from their own sins, have no genius at all, but are mere ordinary men, and but for the fumes of some physical excitement, which they mistake for the airs of inspiration, are absolutely stupider than people generally go, and even without any tolerable abilities for alphabetical education?

There are, however, manifest instances of persons kept sober and temperate from regard to their affairs, and the welfare of those who depend upon them. And it is obvious to every one that habitual excess, a dissolute course of life, implies a general neglect of the duties we owe towards our friends, our families, and our country. From hence <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> manifest that the common virtues and the common vices of mankind may be traced up to benevolence, or the want of it.

According to it, the composers of grammatical Sutras delight as much in the saving of a short vowel as in the birth of a son.

Though the works comprised in each class of Sutras are essentially the same in character, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> natural to suppose that their composition extended over some length of time, and that those which are more concise and precise in their wording are the more recent; for the evolution of their style is obviously in the direction of increased succinctness.

That <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a _maxim_ of the law, that the judges respond to the question of law, and juries only to the question of fact. The answer to this objection is, that, since Magna Carta, judges have had more than six centuries in which to invent and promulgate pretended maxims to suit themselves; and this is one of them. Instead of expressing the law, it expresses nothing but the ambitious and lawless will of the judges themselves, and of those whose instruments they are.[73] 2.

Either voluntarily or involuntarily, he said to himself, when it had finished striking, \"You 're wrong; <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> nine, not ten.\" He turned round that he might not see the dial, and thus he stood for some time, with his hands upon the wagon-rack, gazing at the wood. He knew not how long he had been thus standing, when some one tapped him on the shoulder, and said, \"How much for the load of wood?\" Christopher turned round: there was an odd look of irresolution in his eyes as he said: \"Eh? eh? what time is it?\" \"Half-past ten.\" \"Then the wood is now no longer mine--at least to sell:\"...", "...perseverance, worthy of a better cause, which bad men will exercise in working out their plans.

It looks like cloth, but <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> useless.' That is the old lesson that all sin is profitless and comes to nothing. I venture to connect with that strongly figurative declaration of the essential futility of godless living, our second text, in which Jesus uses a similar figure to express one aspect of His gifts to the believing soul.

He acted the _role_ of an ordinary visitor, talking of the country and the news from Spain. The General, though extremely grumpy, was still capable of ordinary conversation, and his remarks, especially on the Spanish campaign, were those of an intelligent soldier who knew his subject. \"If the Emperor would send me to Spain,\" he growled, \"I would teach those miserable Spaniards a lesson.

In imagination a small crowd of companions surrounded us, every one of them with a special niche in our heart and memory.

Senor Benito Guido says that when a young man he was told by Negritos that this charm would float upstream. And when he offered to give a carabao for it if that were so, its power was not shown.

CHAPTER VII SPANISH ATTEMPTS TO ORGANIZE NEGRITOS The attention of the Spanish Government was early attracted to the Negritos and other savages in the Philippines, and their subjection and conversion was the subject of many royal orders, though unfortunately little was accomplished. One of the first decrees of the Gobierno Superior relating especially to the Negritos was that of...", "...deform children for life. Dr. Dewees mentions a nurse who, from a foolish fondness for displaying them, made the children consigned to her charge sit perfectly upright before they were a month old. It is truly ludicrous, he says, to see the little creatures sitting as straight as if they were stiffened by a back board. It is truly _horrible_, I should say, rather than ludicrous. Crooked spines must be the inevitable consequence, if nothing worse. The practice of bracing children, as <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> called, by straps, back boards, corsets, &c., where it has produced any effect at all, has always had a tendency to crook the spine. This may be seen first, by observing one shoulder to be lower than the other, and next by a projection of the part of the shoulder blades next to the spine. Whenever these changes begin to appear, it is time to send for a physician, though it may often be too late to effect a cure. But on the general subject of bracing and corseting, I have treated...", "...of Leviticus. _I answer that,_ As stated above (I-II, Q. 18, AA. 6, 7), where an act of one virtue is directed to the end of another virtue it partakes somewhat of its species; thus when a man thieves in order to commit fornication, his theft assumes, in a sense, the deformity of fornication, so that even though it were not a sin otherwise, it would be a sin from the very fact that it was directed to fornication. Accordingly, sacrifice is a special act deserving of praise in that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> done out of reverence for God; and for this reason it belongs to a definite virtue, viz. religion. But it happens that the acts of the other virtues are directed to the reverence of God, as when a man gives alms of his own things for God's sake, or when a man subjects his own body to some affliction out of reverence for God; and in this way the acts also of other virtues may be called sacrifices. On the other hand there are acts that are not deserving of praise save through being...", "...by the Eternal Father with a tiara on His head. On each side, the square steeple represents a quadrilateral pierced by a long straight window. This steeple does not rest squarely on the roof, but instead, by means of a slender basis, the narrow sides of which almost touch, it forms an obtuse angle near the ridge of the roof. In Brittany, almost every church has a steeple of this kind. Before returning to the city, we made a detour in order to visit the chapel of _La Mere-Dieu_.

To return from this hasty glance at the remoter consequences of the prophet's ministry, it was in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, and the first of Nebuchadrezzar (xxv. 1) that, in obedience to a Divine intimation, he collected the various discourses which he had so far delivered in the name of God.

Going back now to the days of the _Restoration_ under Zerubbabel and his associates, about 536 B.C., we find that the very first act of the restored captives was to set up \"the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.\" The narrative goes on to specify that \"they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto the Lord, even burnt-offerings morning and evening. They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required; and afterwards offered the continual burnt-offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a free-will offering unto the Lord.\" Ezra 3:1-5.

It is doubtful even whether a number of our poets are aware of the existence of Plato's challenge, and much more doubtful whether they have it in mind as they write. Second thought must make it clear, however, that to prove ignorance of Plato's accusation on the part of one poet and another does not at all impair the possibility that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> his accusation which they are answering. So multiple are the threads of influence leading from the _Republic_ through succeeding literatures and civilizations that it is unsafe to assert, offhand, that any modern expression of hostility to poetry may not be traced, by a patient untangler of evidence, to a source in the _Republic_. But even this is aside from the point. One might concede that the wide-spread modern antagonism to poetry would have been the same if Plato had never...", "...a deux, but marriage cannot.

One caution must be given. This kind of essay will try to lure you into words that seem poetic but really lie; beware that you tell the truth, for a sunset, glorious though it is, is still a sunset. For the higher imaginative flights we reserve our verse. On the other hand, scientific analysis is not for the essay; <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> too impersonal. Nature, as seen in the informal essay, is the nature of emotion that keeps its balance through humor and sanity. Do not, then, write an essay about nature unless you are sure of your balance, unless you are sure that you can tell the truth. But the essayist does not stop with the creations in nature; he goes on to the works of man.

The long duration of Augustus's legislation to raise the birthrate is significant; successful it was not, but the fact that it was maintained on the statute book and systematically revised and developed for three centuries shows that it was at least accounted necessary.

Long after Paul had been an apostle, the Lord Jesus had to come in a very special way to teach him to say, \"I do gladly glory in my infirmities.\" Paul was in danger of being exalted, owing to the revelations from Heaven, and Jesus sent him a thorn in the flesh--yes, Jesus sent it--a messenger of Satan--to buffet him.

There is, however, between Colligation and Induction, a real correlation, which <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> important to conceive correctly. Colligation is not always induction; but induction is always colligation.

In the case of the sphex, too, as in that of many other lower species that provide for offspring they will never see, it is not to be supposed that the welfare of the offspring but rather...", "...these lesions must be removed by frequent lavage, the administration of bismuth subnitrate with the occasional addition of calomel powder, and the limitation of the diet to strained liquids. The cicatricial nature of the stenosis can then be studied to better advantage. In most cases the cicatrices are unmistakably conspicuous. Spasmodic stenoses are differentiated by the absence of cicatrices and the yielding of the stenosis to gentle but continuous pressure of the esophagoscope. While <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> possible that spasmodic stenosis may supplement cicatricial stenosis, it is certainly exceedingly rare. Nearly all of the occasions in which a temporary increase of the stenosis in a cicatricial case is attributed to an element of spasm, the real cause of the intermittency is not spasm but obstruction caused by food. This occurs in three ways: 1. Actual \"corking\" of the strictured lumen by a fragment of food, in which case intermittency may be due to partial regurgitation of the...", "...mental with the choice of occupations.

To the sage the road is long that leads from grief to despair; <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a road untravelled by wisdom. When the soul has attained such loftiness as the life of Antoninus shows us that his had acquired, then is each falling tear illumined by beautiful thought and by generous feeling. He would have taken calamity to him, to all that was purest, most vast, in his soul; and misfortune, like water, espouses the form of the vase that contains it.

BY CORWIN KNAPP LINSON To our Northern eyes the intense brilliancy of the tropical and semi- tropical sky comes as a revelation. Sometimes at noon <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> painfully dazzling; but the evening is a vision of prismatic light holding carnival in the air, wherein Milton's \"twilight gray\" has no part. Unless the sky is held in the relentless grip of a winter storm, the Orient holds no gray in its evening tones; these are translucent and glowing from the setting of the sun until the stars appear. In Greece we are dreamers in that subtle atmosphere, and in Egypt visionaries under the spell of an ethereal loveliness where the filigree...", "...for farce after tragedy, and they gladly relieve themselves by mitigating the solemn seriousness of the tragic drama; for they find, that it is but \"a step from the sublime to the ridiculous.\" The taste for parody will, I fear, always prevail: for whatever tends to ridicule a work of genius, is usually very agreeable to a great number of contemporaries. In the history of parodies, some of the learned have noticed a supposititious circumstance, which, however, may have happened, for <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a very natural one. When the rhapsodists, who strolled from town to town to chant different fragments of the poems of Homer, had recited, they were immediately followed by another set of strollers--buffoons, who made the same audience merry by the burlesque turn which they gave to the solemn strains which had just so deeply engaged their attention.

It is expected to average about 1.1 percent for the 1971-75 five-year period and to decrease thereafter, resulting in an average of between 0.7 and 0.8 percent over the entire period.

It could not be expected that he would feel moral objections, even the most attenuated, for the chances were that while he might not have been a party to the corrupt obtaining of this or that particular franchise, yet he was involved in the grants of other special endowments. Moreover, money making was not built on morality; its whole foundation and impetus lay in the extraction of profits.

Society--and this is a truth which held equally strong of succeeding decades--was incongruously inverted.

But these conditions are other parts or objects of conceivable experience which, as we have learned, fall into a system with the part we say they condition. In our groping and inferential thought one part may become a ground for expecting or supposing the other.

Since then it is in the sphere of essence that movement appears, and since movement manifests its perfection far rather than it divides its being; and since essence, in order to carry out the nature here assigned to it, must always persevere in movement, it would be still more absurd to deny it stability, than to refuse it movement.

A lady asks, \"Is it the summer sun that is harmful to Rhododendrons, Andromedas and Mahonias, or is it the winter sun they should be protected from?\" It is the winter sun. The reason broad-leaved evergreens are such a hard class to bring through the winter in good condition is because the sun shines upon their foliage while <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> frozen, blistering, and searing it. It is not the winter's cold but the winter's sun that does the mischief.

Without raising any question as to the propriety of this prosecution, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> difficult to avoid pointing out that Mr. Vizetelly was singularly ill advised not to have taken into account the essential differences between English and French literature, and not have seen that the publication of this particular book in its entirety was an impossibility under existing conditions.

The most imposing forms of Roman architecture may be traced to a knowledge of the properties of the arch, and as brick was more extensively used...", "...I dare not step within the door; at every turn of the stairs I have a clock, and half the windows of the upper floors are darkened, that shelves may be set before them.

These gifts like the Hebrew ones were paid in advance and were called \"honorariums,\" another term which suggests the modern retainer. Neither an _advocatus_ nor a _patronus_ could sue for such honorarium at law because it was a violation of law, but once paid, the honorarium could not be recovered. Cicero boasted that he never violated the Cincian law, but historians of his period intimate that by secret loans and testamentary gifts his practice proved to be very profitable. And <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> certain, at least, that many of his contemporaries were made very rich by professional remuneration.

The lower and outer ranges of 6000 to 10,000 feet, first receive the diurnal charge of vapour-loaded southerly winds; those beyond them get more of the sun's rays, and the rearward ones more still. Though the summer days of the northern localities are warmer than their elevation would indicate, the nights are not proportionally cold; for the light mist of 14,000 feet, which replaces the dense fog of 7000 feet, effectually obstructs nocturnal radiation, though <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> less an obstacle to solar radiation. Clear nights, be it observed, are as rare at Momay (15,300 feet) as at Dorjiling, the nights if windy being rainy; or, if calm, cold currents descend from the mountains, condensing the moist vapours of the valleys, whose narrow floors are at sunrise bathed in mist at all elevations in Sikkim.

A triple row across the left breast distinguished the principal wife of the chief of Treasury Island.

With regard to the mode of producing these marks, I could only ascertain that they were made by placing the powdered dust of touchwood on the skin and then igniting it. To produce such a permanent and indelible cicatrix, I should think it probable that means were employed to convert the burn into a festering sore. The light colour of these scars would appear to indicate that no pigment is used in the process. I should remark that...", "...theory. Leibnitz, in his celebrated monadology, carries the same view a great deal further. He conceives the whole created universe, visible and invisible, to consist of monads, which are not particles of matter, but metaphysical points of power. These monads are all souls. They are produced by what he calls fulgurations of God. The distinction between fulguration and emanation is this: in the latter case the procession is historically defined and complete; in the former case <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> momentaneous. The monads are radiated from the Divine Will, forth through the creation, by the constant flashes of His volition. All nature is composed of them, and nothing is depopulated and dead. Their naked being is force, and their indestructible predicates are perception, desire, tendency to develop. While they lie dormant, their potential capacities all inwrapped, they constitute what we entitle matter. When, by the rising stir of their inherent longing, they leave their...", "...in Heaven); men are _Kami_ on account of their higher rank. No doubt both gain prestige by their association under the same title--the Gods by a reflection from the pomp and ceremony which attend on mortal _Kami_; and men by assimilation with the transcendent power and glory of the great nature-deities. Why should height come to be everywhere associated with excellence and rank? Herbert Spencer's characteristic contribution[2] to the solution of this problem is as follows: \"In battle <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> important to get the force of gravity to fight on your side, and hence the anxiety to seize a position above that of the foe. Conversely the combatant who is thrown down cannot further resist without struggling against his own weight as well as against his antagonist's strength. Hence being below is so habitually associated with defeat as to have made maintainance of this relation (literally expressed by the words superior and inferior) a leading element in ceremony at large.\" To...", "...supplied.

His orders were to march at once upon Ulm, at the risk of placing the great Austrian army under Kray between him and France; but he was also commanded to detach 15,000 of his troops for the separate service of passing into Italy by the defiles of St. Gothard; and given to understand that it must be his business to prevent Kray, at all hazards, from opening a communication with Italy by way of the Tyrol.

A variety of engagements took place with a variety of fortune.

If you ask, is not this difference at least partly a question of the age in which they took their rise, I reply, yes; but the age itself depends upon the system. However, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a fact that while an economic system does constitute the foundation of every religious and political superstructure, yet below the foundation itself there is always a bed rock upon which it ultimately rests, and this is a question of machinery by which the necessities of life are produced and distributed.

Subtracting these from 351, the total number to be counted forward, there remains the number 335 (351-16), which must be counted forward in Table XV from the beginning of the year.

But at any rate, there is in Paul no doctrine of the inherent evil of matter. The real starting-point of the Pauline doctrine of the flesh is to be found in the Old Testament, in the passages where \"flesh\" denotes human nature in its frailty. Certainly the Pauline teaching is far more highly developed than the teaching of the Old Testament. But the Old Testament provides the starting-point. The \"flesh\" in Paul, when <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> used in its developed, ethical sense, does not mean the material nature of man; it includes rather all that man receives by ordinary generation. The contrast between \"flesh\" and \"Spirit\" therefore is not the contrast between matter and spirit; it is a contrast between human nature, of which sin has taken possession, and the Spirit of God. Certainly, at any rate, whatever solution may be found for the intricate problem of the Pauline use of the term \"flesh,\" the Pauline...", "...of the governed.\" And there is nothing in these two propositions which confines their application to man; there is nothing in them which does not demand that woman should be included as well as man.

In Germany <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> still customary to wear the ring in this fashion, a custom they evidently borrowed from their Roman subjugators, and have retained through every century of change since then. As the luxury of Rome increased, the wearing of rings increased also, and the emperors relaxed the law of restraint. Thus Tiberias, in A.D. 22, gave permission for gold rings to be worn by all persons whose fathers and grandfathers possessed property to the value of 200,000 sesterciae. The Emperors Severus...", "...the better the grade, provided other properties are equal[9]. The color, however, should be a pure or cream white. Some flours have what is called a dead white color, and, while not objectionable as far as color is concerned, they are not as valuable for bread-making and general commercial purposes. One of the principal trade requirements of a flour is that it possess a certain degree of whiteness and none of the objectionable shades mentioned. To determine the color of a flour, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> compared with a standard. If it is a winter wheat flour, one of the best high-grade winter patents to be found on the market is selected, and the sample in question is compared with this; if it is a spring wheat patent flour, one of the best spring wheat patent grades is taken as the standard. In making the comparison, the flours should be placed side by side on a glass plate and smoothed with the flour trier, the comparison being made preferably by a north window.

Shakespeare, Fielding, Goethe, Scott draw noble and generous natures quite as well as they paint the evil natures: indeed they paint them better; they enjoy the painting of them more; they make us enjoy them more. Take this test: if we run over the characters of Shakespeare or of Scott we have to reflect before we find the villains. If we run over the characters in Thackeray, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> an effort of memory to recall the generous and the fine natures. Thackeray has given us some loveable and affectionate men and women; but they all have qualities which lower them and tend to make them either tiresome or ridiculous. Henry Esmond is a high-minded and almost heroic gentleman, but he is glum, a regular kill-joy, and, as his author admitted, something of a prig.

Cancellation of human sin Prayer is not to be used as a confessional to cancel sin. Such an error would impede true religion. Sin is forgiven 5:24 only as <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> destroyed by Christ, - Truth and Life. If prayer nourishes the belief that sin is cancelled, and that man is made better merely by praying, 5:27 prayer is an evil. He grows worse who continues in sin because he fancies himself forgiven.

In our chastest moments we enter a concert-hall or gallery with the deliberate intention of being moved; in our most abandoned we pick up Browning or Alfred de Musset and allow our egotism to bask in their oblique flattery. Now, when we come to art with a mood of which we expect it to make something brilliant or touching there can be no question of being possessed by absolute beauty. The emotion that we obtain is thrilling enough, and exquisite may be; but <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> self-conscious and reminiscent: it is conditioned. It is conditioned by our mood: what is more--critics please take note--this precedent mood not only colours and conditions our experience, but draws us inevitably towards those works of art in which it scents sympathy and approval.

E), but the tone of the narrative is noticeably more advanced, and the presents which the patriarch receives are compensation for the king's offence. Here, however, Sarah has reached her ninetieth year (xvii. 17). (The dates are due to the post-exilic framework in which the stories are inserted.) Still another episode of the same nature is re-corded of Isaac and Rebekah at Gerar, also with Abimelech. Ethically <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> the loftiest, and Isaac obtains his wealth simply through his successful farming. Arising out of the incident is an account of a covenant between Abimelech and Isaac (xxvi. 16-33, J), a duplicate of which is placed in the time of Abraham (xxi. 22-34, J and E).

But like other parvenus <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> still a little uncertain of its position in the society in which it moves. It is a newcomer in the literary world; and it has the self-assertiveness and the touchiness natural to the situation. It brags of its descent, although its origins are obscure. It has won its way to the front and it has forced its admission into circles where it was formerly denied access. It likes to forget that it was once but little better than an outcast, unworthy of recognition from those in...", "...would live with a master that treated him in the same manner. You eat and drink poorly, you are clothed very meanly--the same suit serves you in summer and winter--you go barefoot, and for all this you take no money, though it is a pleasure to get it; for, after a man has acquired it, he lives more genteely and more at his ease. If, therefore, as in all other sorts of arts, apprentices endeavour to imitate their masters, should these who frequent your conversation become like you, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> certain that you will have taught them nothing but to make themselves miserable.\" Socrates answered him in the following manner:--\"You think, Antiphon, I live so poorly that I believe you would rather die than live like me.

You blame me for not taking money; is it because they who take money are obliged to do what they promise, and that I, who take none, entertain myself only with whom I think fit?

We shudder to think of the result of such unions from the three points of view of increasing crime, degeneracy of the race, and miserable households. As to the mere financial mischief that results from domestic peculation, that too is immense from a political point of view. Life being made to cost double, any superfluity becomes impossible in most households. Now superfluity means half the trade of the world, as <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> half the elegance of life. Books and flowers are to many persons as necessary as bread. Lisbeth, well aware of this dreadful scourge of Parisian households, determined to manage Valerie's, promising her every assistance in the terrible scene when the two women had sworn to be like sisters.

Besides his regular college duties, Professor Child had three distinct interests to which he devoted himself in leisure hours with all the energy of an ardent nature. The first of these, editing a complete edition of the old English ballads, was the labor of his life, and with it his name will always be associated, for <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a work that can neither be superseded nor excelled. He was the first to arouse English scholars to the importance of this, as may be read in the dedication of a partial edition taken from the Percy manuscripts and published in London in 1861. He recognized in them the true foundation of the finest literature of the modern world, and he considered them so much the better from the fact that they were not composed to be printed, but to be recited or sung.

The \"good landlord\" arrives in an aide-de-camp uniform, a very old one, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> true, but with epaulettes, and a cocked hat. The effect produced was indescribable. There had been two candidates for this costume, and--will it be believed?--they had quarrelled like two little schoolboys as to which of them should play the part. Both wanted to appear in military uniform with epaulettes. The other actors separated them, and, by a majority of voices, the part was entrusted to Nietsvitaeff; not because he was more suited to it than the other, and that he bore a...", "...any she had seen there before rested upon his brow, and the daughter was anxious to learn the reason of it.

Where the rock is soft or closely jointed <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> often shattered to a depth of several feet beneath the drift, while stony clay has been thrust in among the fragments into which the rock is broken. In the presence of these glaciated surfaces we cannot doubt that the area of the drift has been overridden by vast sheets of ice which, in their steady flow, rasped and scored the rock bed beneath by means of the stones with which their basal layers were inset, and in places plucked and shattered it.

While the adrenal secretion is thus exerting a very stimulating influence on the limb muscles, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> having just the opposite effect on the digestive organs; in fact it is having the effects described above as occurring there during anger. These inhibitory effects are started by the stomach nerves, but are continued by the action of the adrenal juice {124} on the stomach walls.

They argue thus: slaveholding is under all circumstances sinful, it must, therefore, under all circumstances, and at all hazards, be immediately abandoned. This reasoning is perfectly conclusive.

Every thing, therefore, is conceded which the abolitionists need require, when <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> granted that slaveholding is in itself a crime. But how can this assumption be reconciled with the conduct of Christ and the apostles? Did they shut their eyes to the enormities of a great offence against God and man?

Did they abstain from even exhorting masters to emancipate their slaves, though an imperative duty, from fear of consequences?

Here we find it said: \"_He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again_.\" Having pity on the poor, as here spoken of, means giving them such things as they need. Whatever we use in this way God looks upon as so much money lent unto him; and we have his solemn promise that when we lend anything to him, in this way, \"He will pay us again.\" And when he pays again what has been lent to him, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> always with interest. He pays back four, or five, or ten times as much as was lent: to him. This proves that \"giving is God's rule for getting.\" One other passage is all that need be referred to in order to prove that the lesson of liberality which our Saviour taught is the same lesson which the Bible teaches everywhere.

Some one--I think it is the author of \"John Halifax, Gentleman\"--has called friendship a \"Foreshadowing of love\"; and if <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> natural for a woman to have a lover, it is no less natural for a girl to have a great friend among her girl associates. How do girls make friends? and why do their friendships last very often but a short time? or, again, how is it they ever endure a long time? are questions which people who have forgotten their own early friendships, or, perhaps, never gave much thought to them, puzzle over in vain. And they may have puzzled you too, my thoughtful girl-readers, who want the...", "...blessings. The sophistry and lack of ingenuousness which make it possible to present such an argument with a straight face can scarcely be characterized in parliamentary language. It fairly reeks with self-evident fallacies. First of all, if the church chooses to run its affairs on a non-profit basis, that is strictly its own business, and does not concern the state in any way. If it has no property, it escapes taxation as a matter of course, like the individual who has nothing. But if <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> able to own property, it immediately incurs a specific obligation to the state, which is totally independent of the use it makes of its property. The man who retires from business, and lives on his income, is not thenceforward exempted from all taxation, because he is no longer making money. Nor does it serve as an excuse that he is making no profitable investments, but is using up his bare capital, and is spending his time and part of his means in philanthropic work.

Germany is, in name at least, a constitutional monarchy, but <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> because her government owns and administers the railroads, and a powerful and perfectly organized militarism permeates the whole fabric, that she has been able to make such advance as a world power since she became an empire at Versailles.

Indeed, when the legs first appear, they are merely short projections, which <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not always easy to distinguish from the segments themselves.

From actual experience as a chief clerk I know that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> a trying position. It is because the railway chief clerks of the country are as a class such a splendid body of men that I am trying to do what I can to help them. Too many times a chief clerk misses promotion because he is such a valuable man that he has to stand still to break in all the new bosses who come along and leave him in the side track. The chief clerk system as we know it to-day cannot long survive because it is too feudal in conception to reflect the spirit of a...", "...retaining real authority in their own hands.

Even now they are witnessing the displacement of political by social questions, and, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> to be hoped, the successful solution of problems which in the earlier stages of society have defied the efforts of every statesman. Yet they know that, underlying all the political struggles of their history, questions connected with the rights and interests of rich and poor, capitalist and toiler, land-owner and land-cultivator, have always been silently and sometimes violently agitated.

Gerlach states that during this period a small portion of the epiblast, within the region of the area opaca, but close to the posterior border of the area pellucida, becomes thickened by a proliferation of its cells. This portion gradually grows outwards laterally, forming in this way a sickle-shaped structure. From the middle of this sickle a process next grows forward into the area pellucida. This process is the primitive streak, and <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> formed, like the sickle, of proliferating epiblast cells. Koller[563] described the sickle and the growth forwards from it of the primitive streak in surface views somewhat before Gerlach; and in his later memoir has entered with considerable detail into the part played by the various layers in the formation of this structure.

Consequently to suppose that the intelligence [or intelligent soul] is the effect of generation is to suppose that <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not a pure and simple substance, but corruptible like the body. It is therefore heresy to say that this soul is transmitted by generation.\" What is true of the soul should be true of all other form, since no form is a material substance. The utmost possible relation between any two individuals is that God may have used the same stamp or mould for a series of creations, and especially for the less spiritual: \"God is the first model for all things. One may also say that, among His...", "...are always legions. This power of discrimination, to which I have referred, goes deeper, and means far more, than most persons ever realize, and this is why so many are continually deceived. It is the light of understanding, of spiritual intelligence, within the soul of man.

In this case, however, <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> not the mere words, the inflection or pronunciation, but the ideas, sentiments, and principles expressed. \"Liberty, Fraternity, Equality,\" for example; or sympathy, Charity, and loving kindness. The \"sign of the Master\" is at once recognized by one already prepared to receive and to understand it. The soul that really desires truth and wisdom above all things, has thereby developed the power to recognize it. This is the discrimination referred to. It is not what someone...", "...she set up the greater part of the day and walked out for the fist time since she arrived here; she eats hartily and is free from fever or pain.

It would have been wise, we think, in the Westminster Reviewer, before he entered on a discussion of this sort, to settle in what human happiness consists.

The summum bonum of the Utilitarians, as far as we can judge from the passage which we are now considering, is the not being hanged. That <span class=\"clocktext\">it is</span> an unpleasant thing to be hanged, we most willingly concede to our brother. But that the whole question of happiness or misery resolves itself into this single point, we cannot so easily admit. We must look at the thing purchased as well as the price paid for it.
