However, when the tide was out I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labor; for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me very much. After this I went every day on board, and brought away what I could get. I had been now <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> days on shore, and had been eleven times on board the ship; in which time I had brought away all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring, though I believe verily, had the calm weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship piece by piece.

The king had ascertained from these sages \"what time the star appeared\" (Matt. ii. 7), and they seem to have informed him that it had been visible a year before. A Jewish child was said to be two years old _when it had entered on its second year_ (see Greswell's \"Dissertations,\" vol. ii. 136); and, to make sure of his prey, Herod murdered all the infants in Bethlehem and the neighbourhood under the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> months. The wise men had not told him that the child was a year old--it was obvious that they thought very differently--but the tyrant butchered all who came, within the range of suspicion. It is highly probable that the star announced the appearance of the Messiah twelve months before he was born.

When our fathers dissolved their connection with Great Britain, by declaring themselves free and independent States, they constituted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> separate communities, and were careful to assert and preserve, each for itself, its sovereignty and jurisdiction. At a time when the minds of men are straying far from the lessons our fathers taught, it seems proper and well to recur to the original principles on which the system of government they devised was founded.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years Mrs. Burt served the state without salary, giving to its work the best her life afforded freely and without price. With such leaders, under God, and with the true end kept steadily in view, Christian women ought not to fail in their great temperance work.

The first report of this commission, issued in 1842, is one of the most appalling of public documents. Sworn testimony was presented to show that much of the underground labor was performed by children under <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years of age, and that little boys and girls were set to work in the dark and noisome tunnels at the age of five. First as \"trappers\" these child laborers opened and shut the trap-doors in the passages of the mine. The stronger children, boys and girls alike, dragged and pushed the little coal wagons along the narrow passages--the roofs too low for them to stand upright, often so low as to compel them to creep on all- fours in the black slime of the floors.

When the Constitution of the United States was formed, twelve out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> were slaveholding States. Since that time six of those States have become free. How has this been effected? Was it by virtue of abolition agitation in Congress? Was it in obedience to the dictates of the Federal Government?

In consideration of what is to follow, may I say two words relating to the period before I was a governess? I am the orphan daughter of a shopkeeper of Sandwich. My father died, leaving to his widow and child an honest name and a little income of L80 a year. We kept on the shop--neither gaining nor losing by it. The truth is nobody would buy our poor little business. I was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years old at the time; and I was able to help my mother, whose health was then beginning to fail. Never shall I forget a certain bright summer's day, when I saw a new customer enter our shop. He was an elderly gentleman; and he seemed surprised to find so young a girl as myself in charge of the business, and, what is more, competent to support the charge. I answered his questions in a manner which seemed to please him. He soon discovered that my education (excepting my...", "...a sign that some one was treading on the spot of earth in which the person so affected would be buried.

The room into which the elevator entered was large, low-raftered and lighted by a group of candles at the far end. In the centre was a black table, and about the table <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> chairs also black. The one at the head was occupied by a figure garbed in a cloak and hood, with a black mask drawn down to the lips. The other chairs were empty. By the light of the candles the shadows now took shape, the one from the other, and twelve black-cloaked and hooded figures stole forward, also masked to the lips.

I found that the _sambhur_ had been killed in a _nullah_ a hundred yards off while drinking, and had been dragged by the tiger over the top of an almost perpendicular bank, up which I found it necessary to pull myself by my hands, and then over a small and steep hill. As a full-grown hind stands <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> hands high and weighs five hundred pounds or more, this gives one some idea of a tiger's strength. The jungle here consisted of high trees with little undergrowth. As it was now the hot season when most of the leaves are shed, I noticed with satisfaction that the ground around below my _machan_ would be well lighted when the moon rose.

He ran anxiously from one compartment to another; he said to himself that if she had been in the train she would have been one of the first to get out. As he was plunging through the stream of passengers coming from the opposite direction he saw a face which he seemed to know. It was the face of a little girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> or fourteen, chubby, dimpled, and ruddy as an apple, with a little turned-up nose and a large mouth, and a thick plait coiled around her head. As he looked more closely at her he saw that she had in her hand an old valise very much like his own.

This was what is known as the \"Grand Union Flag.\" The British flag, red with a blue union, marked by the upright cross of St. George and the diagonal cross of St. Andrew, was known as the \"Union Flag,\" because it typified, as has been said before, the union of England and Scotland. The new flag retained the blue union with its two crosses, but instead of a red field it had red and white stripes. These thirteen stripes represented the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> colonies; the blue union suggested that the colonies still clung to the mother country. Where the idea of using stripes came from is a question that has never been solved. The Philadelphia Troop had thirteen stripes on their banner, but they were blue and white.

The London company, under the name of Jamestown, established the beginning of the first English town in America, May 13, 1607, with one hundred colonists. Captain John Smith was the genius of the colony, and it enjoyed a certain prosperity while he remained with it. A curious incident of its history was the importation of a large number of young women of good character, who were sold for one hundred and twenty, or even one hundred and fifteen, pounds of tobacco (at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> shillings a pound) to the lonely settlers. The Company failed, with all its expenditures, some half-million dollars, in 1624, and at that time, numbered only two thousand souls--the relics of nine thousand, who had been sent out from England.

Sanudo remembers to have seen an inscription on marble in the mint, dated 1285, commemorating the first striking of the gold ducat of the Venetians in honour of the Blessed Mark the Evangelist and of all saints, in the reign of the renowned Doge of the Venetians, Giovanni Dandolo. This beautiful zecchino (sequin) was worth about nine shillings and sixpence in English money, and admirably illustrates the dress of the Doges during a period of five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years. The evolution of the _corno_ or horn on the ducal bonnet may be clearly traced on the coins issued between the reigns of Francesco Foscari and Leonardo Loredano.

They alone owned the land, and their hundreds of tenants held their farms on rentals or leases, subject to the will of the \"patroons,\" as they were called,--a Dutch adaptation of the old Roman _patronus_, meaning patrician or patron. Only the town-lands of Beverwyck, or Albany, were free from this feudal right--a territory stretching <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> miles north-west, by one mile wide along the river front, and forced from an earlier boy patroon by the doughty Peter Stuyvesant, and secured by later English governors; and at the time of our story, though the old feudal laws were no longer in force, and the rentals were less exacting than in the earlier days, the tenantry of Rensselaerswyck respected the authority and manorial rights of Stephen Van Rensselaer, their boy patroon, who, with his widowed mother and his brothers...", "...neither is there any [other], who rules so many free people, so many true Christians: which thing renders thy government more honourable, thyself more considerable, than the accession of many nations filled with slavish and superstitious souls.\"--ROBERT BARCLAY: _Apology_, p. viii. 22.

Her parents were Ralph and Abiah Hall, who removed during her infancy from Alstead, New Hampshire, the place of her birth, to Salem, in the State of Massachusetts.

On p. 256, Barney's force in St. Leonard's creek, is described as consisting of one sloop, two gun-boats, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> barges, with in all somewhat over 500 men; and it is claimed that the flotilla drove away the blockading frigates, entirely unaided; the infantry force on shore rendering no assistance. The work is of some value, as showing that James had more than doubled the size, and almost doubled the strength, of Barney's various gun-boats.

As there are six negroes to four whites in the State, and as the negroes pay less than ten per cent of the school taxes, such a division of the school fund will give the white children <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> days' schooling to the negro's one. \"Such a proposition is illogical, pernicious, insane. \"Look at the logic of it. Governor Wordyfellow defends the general proposition by some scattering statistics which prove to his mind that education generally is not good for the negro; but he justifies the division of the school fund on the basis of contribution upon the supposed principle that the negro will get back all that he pays in and therefore cannot rightly demand more....", "...is come!\" Well, as I was saying, the doctor distributed medicine as long as he had any to distribute, and his reputation is mighty in Galilee this day.

The General once came out to look over the Twenty-sixth Infantry, and stopped in front of the redoubtable Sergeant Murphy and his platoon. Now, Sergeant Murphy could stand with equanimity as high an officer as a colonel, but a general was one too many. He was not afraid of a machine gun or a cannon, but a star on a man's shoulder petrified him. After the General had watched for a minute, the good sergeant had his platoon tied up in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> different ways. The General spoke to him. That finished it; and if the General had not left the field, I think Sergeant Murphy would have. With all of us comic incidents in plenty occurred.

Once upon a time, many hundred years ago, when Rome was mistress of the world, and the Romans were braver and stronger than any one else, there lived a boy of thirteen whose name is still remembered. Lucius Valerius was fond of his lessons, but most of all did he love poetry; so, although he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years old, he made up his mind that he would try to win the gold medal and ivory lyre which were given every five years to the boy who should write the best poem. Lucius not only tried, but he succeeded, and one day, before all the school and a number of visitors, the prizes were presented to him. Now besides the medal and lyre which every one who gained them valued very much, there was something else which they thought far grander. A statue of the prize-winner was placed in...", "...from a copy obtained and translated by Dalrymple, who suggested the name of Torres Strait for the principal discovery of that navigator.

The actual results of the voyages of Quiros and Torres were the discovery of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> coral islands in the Pacific, of the Duff and Banks groups, of the New Hebrides, of the eastern end and southern coast of New Guinea, and of Torres Strait, with its innumerable islands: not a barren record.

He had before him a dreary seven years of memorialising Councils, of obstruction and delays. It wore him out; but he was led to believe...", "...time.

The league started with a sustaining membership of 1,400, including organizations in Baltimore and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> counties. By 1920 the city was organized by congressional districts and some of these by wards; twenty of the twenty-three counties had organizations, some of them strong branch leagues, others merely small groups with a chairman.

Little change, however, seems to have been made since the time of Ibn Jubair, who describes the floor and walls as overlaid with richly variegated marbles, and the upper half of the walls as plated with silver thickly gilt, while the roof was veiled with coloured silk. Modern writers describe the place as windowless, but Ibn Jubair mentions five windows of rich stained glass from Irak. Between the three pillars of teak hung <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> silver lamps. A chest in the corner to the left of one entering contained Korans, and at the Irak corner a space was cut off enclosing the stair that leads to the roof. The door to this stair (called the door of mercy--Bab el-Rahma) was plated with silver by the caliph Motawakkil.

The species is often met with, sometimes in considerable numbers, upon the shores of the Arctic lands, and within the region of the ices of the Greenland sea. It not unfrequently occurs of the length of seven or eight feet, and four or five feet high, weighing as much as a small ox. Specimens whose skin measured twelve to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> feet in length, have been described by voyagers. The \"paw of the bear,\" of which there is Scriptural mention, may, in the full-grown animal, as now met with, be from seven to nine inches in breadth, and large enough to overspread two-thirds of a square foot, or more, of the snowy surface on which it treads. Hence its admirable adaptation for the region in which Providence has placed its abode. Of this animal the Arctic whaler has frequent opportunities of making captures,...", "...1 Kings ix. 16.

The approach to the island by water afforded a fine picture. Well-wooded hills of vivid greenness rise above the sea all about the town. These hills grow more or less lofty as they recede inland, until they culminate in three mountain peaks. Penang, like Singapore, is an island some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> miles long by ten in width, and is separated from the main-land of the Peninsula by a narrow belt of sea not more than three miles in width, giving it a position of great commercial importance. It resembles Singapore in many respects, and is almost identical with it so far as it relates to its general products and vegetation; the season, likewise, is one long, unvarying summer.

Its specific gravity is 19.3; when heavier, it must be combined with platina; when lighter, and of a deep yellow color, it is alloyed with copper; and if of a pale color, with silver.

To enlarge them procure a piece of cardboard nine by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> inches, or a little larger than twice the size of the drawing each way, and divide it into squares just twice the size of those on page 111. That will make sixteen squares in the width of the cardboard and twenty-four in the length, each half an inch square.

But the crowd vanished as quickly as they had come, leaving the burly Thersites, and two or three irresolute fellows of his tribe, standing within pistol range of my levelled rifle. Such a sudden dispersion of the mob which, but a moment before, was overwhelming in numbers, caused me to lower my rifle, and to indulge in a hearty laugh...", "...forbidding ways Of custom, law, and statute took at once The attraction of a country in romance. Those were the days in which Wordsworth, then an under-graduate at Cambridge, spent a college vacation in tramping through France, landing at Calais on the eve of the very day (July 14, 1790) on which Louis XVI. signalized the anniversary of the fall of the Bastile by taking the oath of fidelity to the new constitution. In the following year Wordsworth revisited France, where he spent <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> months, forming an intimacy with the republican general, Beaupuis, at Orleans, and reaching Paris not long after the September massacres of 1792. Those were the days, too, in which young Southey and young Coleridge, having married sisters at Bristol, were planning a \"Pantisocracy,\" or ideal community, on the banks of the Susquehannah, and denouncing the British government for going to war with the French Republic.

It is not my object to enumerate rights of inconsiderable [34] importance; but there are others, no doubt, which ought to be established as a fundamental part of the national system. It is worthy of observation, that all treaties are made by foreign nations with a confederacy of thirteen states--that the western country is attached to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> states--thirteen states have jointly and severally engaged to pay the public debts.--Should a new government be formed of nine, ten, eleven, or twelve states, those treaties could not be considered as binding on the foreign nations who made them.

The Turkmans are passionately fond of hawking; they course the game with grey-hounds, or if in the plain, they run it down with their horses. The population of the Ryhanlu Turkmans may be roughly calculated from the number of their tents, which amount to about three thousand; every tent contains from two or three to fifteen inmates. They can raise a military force of two or three thousand horsemen, and of as many infantry. They are divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> minor tribes: 1.

Signed at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, after much dispute over representation, the Constitution of the United States of America entered into effect once all <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> states ratified it. Its major significance derives from its ascertainment of an effective alternative to monarchy. The system of checks and balances contained in the Constitution is meant to preserve any one branch of government from assuming absolute authority.

Bach, therefore, found himself installed as organist with a salary of fifty florins, with, in addition, thirty thalers for board and lodging--equivalent in all to about eight pounds <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> shillings of English money--a small enough salary indeed! but one which in those days was considered to be a fair emolument for the services of a young player. On August 14, 1703, Bach, who was then eighteen years old, entered upon his duties, having previously taken a 'solemn pledge of diligence and faithfulness, and all that appertaineth to an honourable servant and organist before God and the worshipful Corporation.'

In the one day and a half of his own time he was paid three shillings and four pence or 80 cents for every ninety cane holes. Under this agreement the maximum work performed was that of an apprentice who in three weeks of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> and one half days dug in his own time 1,017 holes, for which he received 28 pounds of fish, and in cash one pound and fifteen shillings or $8.40.

The cost to him, if the work had been given out to jobbers, would have been L8 an acre or L464, $2,227.20. His apprentices were therefore the means of saving for him the sum of L316 l0d or $1,519.20.

To have offered to the people at that time, a system of government armed with the powers necessary to regulate and control the contending interests of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> States, and the possessions of millions of people, might have raised a jealousy between the States or in the minds of the people at large, that would have weakened the operations of war, and perhaps have rendered a union impracticable.

There is a curious tradition in regard to the origin of this title. When Louis XIV was in Belgium, during his Flemish campaign, it was discovered one evening that there were but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> to sit down at his table. The King was too superstitious to allow this, so sent out an aide to find some one to make the fourteenth. Of course only noblemen sat at the King's table, but as the aide was unable to find any one of suitable rank he brought in a wayfarer, or villain. The King at once ennobled him, calling him Comte Vilain XIIII, and the title is still written in this way. [Illustration: M.

Chief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court, insists at great length that negroes were no part of the people who made, or for whom was made, the Declaration of Independence, or the Constitution of the United States. On the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in five of the then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters, and in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the Constitution that the white people had.

For even at a much later period there were men of exalted attainments who doubted the applicability of the republican principle to large sections of territory, and who would have sough in the division of the country, or in the establishment of what was then deemed a stronger government that security which they did not expect in an American republic. The revolution through the town governments had three principal points of support.

In 1549, repairs being once more required, a stair was added; and in 1582 a crane was erected. In 1621, two corn-mills were built within flood-mark; and about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years later, a weigh-house, which served also for a custom-house, was erected.

In 1050 <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> times as much silver, eight times as much copper, and fourteen times as much iron was produced as in 800. Thus the circulation of the copper currency was increased. The cost of minting, however, amounted in China to about 75 per cent and often over 100 per cent of the value of the money coined. In addition to this, the metal was produced in the south, while the capital was in the north.

In charge of its garrison was Marshal Boufflers, a splendid officer. Louis was as resolute to defend and keep the place as the Allies were to take it. The actual investment of the town was placed in the hands of Eugene, whose men had by this time arrived, while Marlborough covered him. The siege train brought up by the Duke and his generals stretched to a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> miles. Berwick and Vendome were at no great distance away. The siege of Lille lasted a full two months, and few military operations have produced more splendid examples of individual dash and courage.

Throughout the siege there had been some difficulty in procuring provisions for the Allies, and supplies were drawn from Ostend. On this occasion an expected convoy had not arrived to...", "...he became editor of the _Kennebec Journal_, and subsequently of the _Portland Advertiser_. But his editorial work was soon abandoned for a more active public career. He was elected to the lower house of the state legislature in 1858, and served four years, the last two as speaker. He also became chairman of the Republican state committee in 1859, and for more than twenty years personally directed every campaign of his party. In 1862 he was elected to Congress, serving in the House <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years (December 1863 to December 1876), followed by a little over four years in the Senate. He was chosen speaker of the House in 1869 and served three terms. The House was the fit arena for his political and parliamentary ability. He was a ready and powerful debater, full of resource, and dexterous in controversy. The tempestuous politics of the war and reconstruction period suited his aggressive nature and constructive talent. The measures for the rehabilitation of the...", "...from a far-off country; and for matin hymn and vesper song, we are to be beset through a long and stormy period, with sounds of strife and terror, and deadly conflict.

The Plymouth Company had been formed at the same time as the London Company, but it had accomplished very little.[95] In 1607 it dispatched an expedition under George Popham and Raleigh Gilbert to the River Kennebec, in the territory afterwards called Maine. The climate, however, did not suit the adventurers, and owing to the mismanagement of the leaders and the indifference of the Company nothing came of the undertaking. For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years the Plymouth Company made no further effort, but in 1620 it was entirely reorganised, placed upon a new footing, and renamed the New England Company. This may have been caused by two things. In the first place Captain John Smith had made a voyage to New England in 1614; it was indeed that resourceful but perhaps boastful adventurer who either gave the name by which the country was afterwards known, or gave currency to an already existing though not generally accepted...", "...in the first place.

Was there some vexation in the heart of the \"Admiral of India\" when the command of the new fleet was given to Pedro Cabral? History is silent. Anyhow, in the March of 1500 we find this \"Gentleman of Great Merit\" starting off with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> powerfully armed ships and some fifteen hundred men, among them the veteran explorer Bartholomew Diaz, a party of eight Franciscan friars to convert the Mohammedans, eight chaplains, skilled gunners, and merchants to buy and sell in the King's name at Calicut. The King himself accompanied Cabral to the waterside. He had already adopted the magnificent title, \"King, by the Grace of God, of Portugal, and of the Algarves, both on this side the sea and beyond it in Africa, Lord of...", "...who succeeded him, did not attempt to prolong the contest; but peace without surrender was impossible.

Summoning his courage, Benedict excommunicated Nogaret, Colonna, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> others, whom he had seen break into the palace at Anagni. Within a month he was dead. Poison was whispered, and, for the first time since the monks captured the papacy, the hierarchy was paralyzed by fear.

But, at the end, the withering majorities in Democratic strongholds remained unbroken, re-electing Marcy and Tracy by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> thousand majority,[280] and carrying every senatorial district save the eighth, and ninety-one of the one hundred and twenty-two assemblymen.

Shekel was translated into Greek by _Stater_, and an Athenian gold stater, like the Persian gold stater, down to the times of Croesus, Darius, and Alexander, was the sixtieth part of a mina of gold, not very far therefore from our sovereign. The proportion of silver to gold was fixed as thirteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> and a third to one; and if the weight of a silver shekel was made as thirteen to ten, such a coin would correspond very nearly to our florin.[14] Half a silver shekel was a _drachma_, and this was therefore the true ancestor of our shilling.

When I was eleven years old I became acquainted with a boy somewhat younger than myself, and in this case the proposal for mutual masturbation came from his side.

On the morning of the 3d of June, soon after daylight, General Grant threw his whole army straightforward against Lee's front--all along his line. The conflict which followed was one of those bloody grapples, rather than battles, which, discarding all manoeuvring or brain-work in the commanders, depend for the result upon the brute strength of the forces engaged. The action did not last half an hour, and, in that time, the Federal loss was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> thousand men. When General Lee sent a messenger to A.P.

Thus in Macbeth we find 'this three mile.'

From the Son of the Merchant at school the young Prince learnt the stories of foreign kingdoms. From the Son of the Kotwal he learnt the adventures of the Two Genii of the Lamp.

In time the vault was neglected, and it was preserved only by the efforts of a survivor, Benjamin Romaine, who bought the plot of ground on which the monument stood, when it was sold for taxes, and preserved it.

It was characteristic of the king, however, to be slow in retreating from any position he had taken; and, as we shall often have occasion to see, there was a certain apathy or sluggishness in his nature, which led him sometimes to leave events to take their own course, rather than to shape a course for them himself.

There is, indeed, sir, another method of incorporation, by adding new companies to each regiment; but of this method the advantage would be small, because the number of captains and inferiour officers must be the same, and the pay of only the field officers would be saved, and this trifling gain would be far over-balanced by the inconveniencies which experience has shown to arise from it.

On these carts were loaded baggage and provisions, and the men and boys pulled them across the plains. Sometimes the women and girls helped. A few ox teams usually hauled the heaviest loads in wagons, and in this way the Saints walked and pulled their carts over the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> hundred miles of their journey. This plan succeeded very well for those who started early and reached the valley in good time, but a number of companies started too late and were caught in fierce snow storms in the mountains.

It is hardly accurate, for instance, to say that Monteverde's Orfeo was the first form of the recitative-Opera, as Peri's Dafne and Euridice and Cavaliere's Rappresentazione preceded it by some years, and it is somewhat exaggerated to say that 'under the regime of the Commonwealth the national growth of English music received a check from which it never afterwards recovered,' as it was with Cromwell's auspices that the first English Opera was produced, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years before any Opera was regularly established in Paris. The fact that England did not make such development in music as Italy and Germany did, must be ascribed to other causes than 'the prevalence of Puritan opinion.' These, however, are minor points.

They demanded that we provide some conveyance in which to be taken to Lancaster, which was some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> miles from us. To this I replied that we had none; that we always traveled afoot. Knowing this to be true, they had no more to say other than that they would furnish conveyances at their own expense, wherein we could ride to Lancaster.

Lucius not only tried, but he succeeded, and one day, before all the school and a number of visitors, the prizes were presented to him.

Once or twice the periscope of a submarine was sighted--without any disastrous results--but in the main this business of mine-laying was uneventful. Just what was accomplished the chart makes clear. In the summer and autumn months of 1918 the American forces laid 56,571 mines and the British 13,546. The operation was to have been a continuous one; had the war gone on for two years we should probably...", "...in the Northland. Wallin is Scandinavia's greatest hymnist and perhaps the foremost in the entire Christian Church during the Nineteenth century. The Swedish \"Psalm-book\" of 1819, which for more than a century has been the hymn-book of the Swedish people in the homeland and in other parts of the world, is in large measure the work of this one man. Of the 500 hymns in this volume, 128 are original hymns from his pen, 178 are revisions by Wallin, twenty-three are his translations, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> are semi-originals based on the hymns of other authors. In brief, no less than 342 of the hymns of the \"Psalm-book\" reflect the genius of this remarkable writer. Early in life Wallin began to reveal poetic talent. Born at Stora Tuna, Dalarne province, in 1779, he overcame the handicaps of poverty and poor health and at the age of twenty-four he had gained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Upsala. In 1805, and again in 1809, he won the chief prize for...", "...to seeing machines falling down, but I must say it impressed me very deeply when I saw the first Englishman fall and I have often seen the event again in my dreams.

During the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years' imprisonment which he suffered, the sentiments of the nation were much changed with regard to him. Men had leisure to reflect on the hardship, not to say injustice, of his sentence; they pitied his active and enterprising spirit, which languished in the rigors of confinement; they were struck with the extensive genius of the man, who, being educated amidst naval and military enterprises, had surpassed, in the pursuits of literature, even those of the most recluse and...", "...impossible to construct each of these subdivisions out of single timbers. A distinction was made between \"whole\" or single-spar masts and \"armed\" and \"made masts.\" The first were used for the lighter spars, for small vessels and the Mediterranean craft called \"polacras.\" Armed masts were composed of two single timbers. Made masts were built of many pieces, bolted and \"coaked,\" i.e. dovetailed and fitted together, fastened round by iron hoops, and between them by twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> close turns of rope, firmly secured. \"Made masts\" are stronger than those made of a single tree and less liable to be sprung. The general principle of construction is that it is built round a central shaft, called in English the \"spindle\" or \"upper tree,\" and in French the _meche_ or wick. The other pieces--\"side trees,\" \"keel pieces,\" \"side fishes,\" \"cant pieces\" and \"fillings\" are \"coaked,\" i.e. dovetailed and bolted on to and around the \"spindle,\" which itself...", "...of love and kind words towards the poor fallen creatures who abound in our city, and how much stronger they are than prison bars, how much more powerful than handcuffs, fetters and whip lashes, we should soon see the spirit of reformation hovering over us like the guardian angel sent to save a city that should be found to contain only five righteous persons.

It was received everywhere with the greatest joy. Bells were rung, cannon were fired, fireworks were burned, and flags were flung to the breeze. The bands played martial music, and even the smallest towns and villages were in a blaze of excitement. Washington ordered the Declaration to be read to all the brigades of the patriot army in and around New York City.

It would be much better to have the nineteen parts of citrine reduced, say, to half intensity, when the area would be increased to thirty-eight, with the figure of eight parts of blue and five of red, than of thirteen parts of purple. But it would be better still if there were the thirty-eight parts of reduced citrine, three parts of pure yellow, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> of purple, five of red, and eight of blue, together with white, black, or gold, or all three (these may be added without altering the conditions, as all act as neutrals), for here the harmony is of a more subtle character.

Governor Neve arrived from San Gabriel, inspected the new site, and expressed himself as pleased with all that had been done. A few days later he, with Padre Serra, and a number of soldiers and officers, started up the coast, and, selecting a site known to the Indians after the name of their chief, _Yanonalit_, established the presidio of Santa Barbara. Yanonalit was very friendly, and as he had authority over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> rancherias he was able to help matters along easily. This was April 21, 1782. When Serra came to the establishment of the presidio, he expected also to found the Mission, and great was his disappointment. This undoubtedly hastened his death, which occurred August 28, 1782.

His height was about eight of his own feet, which were very long. He was of a strong robust make; his legs and thighs very stout, and his sinews firm. His face was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> inches long; his beard a palm; his nose half a palm; his forehead a foot over. His lion-like eyes flashed fire like carbuncles; his eyebrows were half a palm over. When he was angry, it was a terror to look upon him. He required eight spans for his girdle, besides what hung loose. He ate sparingly of bread; but a whole quarter of lamb, two fowls, a goose, or a large portion of pork; a peacock, crane, or a whole hare. He drank moderately of wine and water. He was so strong,...", "...out with bird-shot, if he hadn't made the quickest drop of his life.

Bullinger[609] attempts a classification of their different divisions, and mentions <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> distinct sects within the Anabaptist circle; but they manifestly overlap in such a way as to suggest a very large amount of difference which cannot be distinctly tabulated.

A hundred yards east and west of this narrowest portion of the pass were good places of concealment. I placed Sergeant Cunningham and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> men at the western end, and took as many and the boys with me to the eastern. The sergeant was instructed to keep his men perfectly quiet until the head of the herd had passed their place of concealment, and then, under cover of the noise made by the moving animals, to slip down into the canon, and when the rear of the herd came up make a dash across the front of the Indians and begin firing, taking care not to hit us.

He beat his boys much, but taught them little. To finish his education his father sent George for one quarter to a better school.

His work was very hard. He had to light fires, clean windows, groom horses, and make himself generally useful. His master was fond of drink, and George had to get his meals at a public-house. One of his duties was to serve out spirits to customers who made good purchases.

Binet states that the main factors involved in success are \"attention, visual memory, and a little analysis.\" The power of rapid analysis would seem to be the most important, for if the designs are analyzed they may be reproduced from a verbal memory of the analysis. Without some analysis it would hardly be possible to remember the designs at all, as one of them contains <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> lines and the other twelve. The memory span for unrelated objects is far too limited to permit us to grasp and retain that number of unrelated impressions. Success is possible only by grouping the lines according to their relationships, so that several of them are given a unitary value and remembered as one. In this manner, the design to the right, which is composed of twelve lines, may be reduced to four elements: (1) The outer rectangle; (2) the inner rectangle; (3) the...", "...and construction.

Completely destroying the villages, churches, castles, vineyards, and orchards, they left a desolate waste behind them. In this retreat the Germans gave up French territory to the extent of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> hundred square miles. The German retirement was closely followed by British and French troops. Great courage was shown by Canadian troops in the taking of Vimy Ridge on April 9.

These numbers are lamentably large. That the horrible crime of murder should ever be perpetrated is a most melancholy fact; and that so many as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> murders should be committed in one year must fill the mind of every moral man and lover of his country with grief and shame.

Fleta remarks, in the reign of Edward I. or II., that unless an acre yielded more than six bushels of corn, the farmer would be a loser, and the land yield no rent.[702] And Sir John Cullum, from very minute accounts, has calculated that nine or ten bushels were a full average crop on an acre of wheat. An amazing excess of tillage accompanied, and partly, I suppose, produced this imperfect cultivation. In Hawsted, for example, under Edward I., there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> or fourteen hundred acres of arable, and only forty-five of meadow ground. A similar disproportion occurs almost invariably in every account we possess.[703] This seems inconsistent with the low price of cattle.

The rent of land differed of course materially; sixpence an acre seems to have been about the average for...", "...4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia and the United Colonies dissolved all ties that bound them to England and became an independent nation--the United States.

With a view of showing the capabilities of our river in the production of fish, I have aggregated the scores from 1872 to 1882 inclusive.

In the year 1881 the average size of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> trout taken with a single rod in eight days' fishing was one pound fourteen ounces. Not one of these fish was wasted. A few were eaten upon the stream, but most of them were given to the guides, who salted and packed them in barrels for future use.

Sometimes the nuns seem actually to have lacked food and clothes, and it seems clear that in many cases the revenues of these convents were insufficient for their support and that they were dependent upon the charity of friends. A typical case is that of Legbourne, where one of the nuns informed Bishop Alnwick (1440) that since the revenues of the house did not exceed L40 and since there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> nuns and one novice, it was impossible for so many of them to have sufficient food and clothing from such inadequate rents, unless they received assistance from secular friends[455].

[Illustration: FIG. 189 ROBERT OWEN (1771-1858)] When he took charge of the mills at New Lanark (1799) he found the usual wretched social conditions of the time. Children of five, six, and seven years were bound out to the factory as apprentices (R. 242) for a period of nine years. They worked as apprentices and helpers in the factories twelve to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> hours a day, and at early manhood were turned free to join the ignorant mass of the population. Owen sought to remedy this condition. He accordingly opened schools which children might enter at three years of age, receiving them into the schools almost as soon as they were able to walk, and caring for them while their parents were at work. Children under ten he forbade to work in the mills, and for these he provided schools. The instruction for the children younger than six was...", "...brought to the task nothing more than ordinary sense. I found our author declaring, as others had declared before him, that under certain circumstances Eusebius would be sure to act in a particular way. I turned to Eusebius himself, and I found that, whenever we are able to test his action under the supposed circumstances, he acts in precisely the opposite way. I discovered that he not only sometimes, but systematically, ignores mere quotations from the four Gospels and the Acts and the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> Epistles of St Paul, however numerous and however precise. I cannot indeed recollect a single instance where he adduces a quotation for the mere purpose of authenticating any one of these books.

In November, 1876, more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years after his discharge, under the same name of John M. Johns, he filed an application for pension, alleging a fever sore on his right leg contracted July 1, 1862, which resulted in the loss of the leg. His claim was rejected in November, 1882, after a thorough special examination, on the ground that the disease of the leg resulting in amputation was contracted after the soldier's discharge from the service. The leg was amputated in February, 1865.

Once again it possessed Mesopotamia and controlled its caravan road to Haran and Phoenicia, and apparently its relations with the Hittites and Syrians were of a cordial character.

He was succeeded by Marduk-aplu-iddin I, who presided over the destinies of Babylonia for about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years. Thereafter the glory of the Kassite Dynasty passed away. King Zamama-shum-iddin followed with a twelvemonth's reign, during which his kingdom was successfully invaded from the north by the Assyrians under King Ashur-dan I, and from the east by the Elamites under a king whose name has not been traced.

Similarly, the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union at their fourth convention in June, 1899, established a national sick benefit.[134] This system became operative on January 1, 1900, and provided for members in good standing sick benefits of five dollars per week for not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> weeks in any one year.[135] [Footnote 134: Proceedings of the Second Convention, Boston, 1896 (Lynn, n.d.), pp. 42-46; Third Convention, Boston, 1897 (Lynn, n.d.); Fourth Convention, Rochester, 1899 (Lynn, n.d.).] [Footnote 135: Constitution, 1899, sec. 65.] Besides the unions thus described, the Barbers, the Bakers, the Leather Workers on Horse Goods, and the Plumbers each pay five dollars per week, the last two for thirteen weeks in any one year, the Barbers for...", "...had been wont to array themselves all in like suit once in the year, and, after meeting together at Stratford, on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary[189] to come from thence to the Church of St. Vedast, in London, there to hear Mass on the same day, in honour of the said glorious Virgin. But the said masters of the trade asserted to the contrary of all this, and said that the fraternity, and the being so arrayed in like suit among the serving-men, dated from only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years back, and even then had been discontinued of late years; and that under a certain feigned colour of sanctity, many of the serving-men in the trade had influenced the journeymen among them and had formed covins thereon, with the object of raising their wages greatly in excess; to such an extent, namely, that whereas a master in the said trade could before have had a serving-man or journeyman for 40 shillings or 5 marks yearly, and his board, now such a man would not agree...", "...size, from that of Vesta to that of an aerolite, and when the channels just described had ceased to exist, the contents of the planet would disperse themselves with lower velocities and without any unity of direction.

Further significant evidence is furnished by the comets of short periods. Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> constituting this group, twelve have orbits falling between those of Mars and Jupiter: one only having its aphelion beyond the orbit of Jupiter. That is to say, nearly all of them frequent the same region as the planetoids. By implication, they are similarly associated in respect of their periods. The periods of the planetoids range from 3.1 to 8.8 years; and all these twelve comets have periods falling between these extremes: the least being 3.29 and the greatest 8.86.

Founded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by John Lyon, a yeoman of the parish, the school has now grown enormously, the oldest portion being that near the church, which was erected three years after the founder's death.

Then she could go out with him and stop the little boats and the great steamers, and make them drop seven cents or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> cents into her hands as she stood braced in the stern; and she was just beginning to wonder how she could toss up the change to them if they dropped her a quarter, when the captain began to sing Tom Bowline.

Splendid as they are, we feel that a little more light should have been admitted, and this thought must also have struck the glazier, because he resorted to a trick in the choir chapels to better illumine the eastern part of the structure.

His victory, in fact, was almost as ruinous as a defeat. Greene lay for two days within ten miles of him, near the Iron Works on Troublesome Creek, gathering up his scattered troops. He had imbibed the spirit of Washington, and...", "...reports that he was delirious, and after a good rest was apparently none the worse for the task. In 1876 he again traversed this passage with the happiest issue. In 1883 he was engaged by speculators to swim the rapids at Niagara, and in attempting this was overcome by the powerful currents, and his body was not recovered for some days after. The passage from Dover to Calais has been duplicated. In 1877 Cavill, another Englishman, swam from Cape Griz-Nez to South Forland in less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> hours. In 1880 Webb swam and floated at Scarborough for seventy-four consecutive hours--of course, having no current to contend with and no point to reach. This was merely a feat of staying in the water. In London in 1881, Beckwith, swimming ten hours a day over a 32-lap course for six days, traversed 94 miles. Since the time of Captain Webb, who was the pioneer of modern long-distance swimming, many men have attempted and some have duplicated his feats; but these foolhardy...", "...may be the very island of Podee over which he reigned, and we ought not to be greatly surprised to see him look in upon us at any moment, with his paradise plume waving among the tops of the trees, and his spear, eighteen feet long, in his hand.\" \"Don't let Rogerogee disturb your dreams, Johnny,\" said Arthur, \"if there is any such place as the island of Podee, which I very much doubt, it is, according to Roby's own account, but a few leagues to the east of Papua, and some twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> hundred miles at least, west of us.\" Max now got up, and after stretching himself, and giving three or four great yawns, came towards the spot where the rest of us were sitting; but after taking a few steps, he suddenly stopped, uttering an exclamation of surprise, and looking down at something in the grass at his feet.

Later the American flotilla retired up the lake to Otter Creek in Vermont, where, on April 11, 1814, was launched the ship \"Saratoga,\" which carried Macdonough's pendant in the battle five months afterwards. On May 10, Pring, hoping to destroy the American vessels before ready for service, made another inroad with his squadron, consisting now of the new brig, called the \"Linnet,\" five armed sloops, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> galleys. On the 14th he was off Otter Creek and attacked; but batteries established on shore compelled him to retire. Macdonough in his report of this transaction mentions only eight galleys, with a bomb vessel, as the number of the enemy engaged. The new brig was probably considered too essential to naval control to be risked against shore guns; a decision scarcely to be contested, although Prevost seems to have been dissatisfied as usual with the exertions of the navy.

That any bookseller should think it worth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while to publish seems extraordinary. But with this, neither the author nor the public have any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon those parts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively obsolete. The public are entreated to bear in mind that <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years have passed since it was finished, many more since it was begun, and that during that period, places, manners, books, and opinions have undergone considerable changes.

In the year of QUEEN VICTORIA'S Diamond Jubilee he visited England as a _Wunderkind_, being then only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years of age, and created a _furore_ by his precocious virtuosity. About eleven years later, while he was still in his teens, he appeared at the Philharmonic Concerts with his second wife, a soprano singer of remarkable attainments. The present Madame Atichewsky, it should be noted, has a wonderful contralto voice, which is inherited by her second daughter, Ladoga, who recently made her _debut_ at the Theatre de la Monnaie, in Brussels. * * * *...", "...Lieutenant Nickerson, R.A.M.C., who had accompanied the wounded after the misfortune at Stormberg, arrived in camp. Father Ryan's servant, on whose account General Gatacre, as already mentioned, addressed Commandant Olivier, also returned. They brought interesting news.

Septuagenarians and striplings were drafted into the commandoes, while at Burghersdorp the Town Guard was composed of lads of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years of age. This showed that the stream of reinforcements was beginning to run dry. Many youngsters were said to have been sent from their college at Bloemfontein straight to the front.

The correspondents were flattered, and began to calculate whether \"Experiences in Pretoria\" would make good \"copy,\" but finally decided for the liberty of...", "...Marie. Of course the village children came to play with Snow White. She was such a charming little girl, with a very white skin, eyes as blue as the sky, and lovely golden hair. To be sure, her cheeks were not so rosy as those of her companions, but she was so bright and gentle that everyone loved her very much indeed. The winter passed very quickly and Snow White grew so fast that by the time the trees were veiled in the green buds of spring she was as tall as a girl of twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years. During the winter months the snow maiden had been very joyous and happy, but when the mild, warm days of spring came she seemed sad and low-spirited. Her mother, Marie, noticed the change and said to her, \"My dear little girl, why are you sad? Tell me, are you ill?\" \"No, mother, dear, I am not ill,\" said Snow White. But she no longer seemed to enjoy playing out of doors with the other children; she stayed very quietly in the cottage. One lovely spring day the...", "...appeared so strange to me. I will name one case.

On my return you were near the house chopping wood. \"Well, Simon, did you read the piece?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Why not?\" \"I came to a word I did not know.\" This word was just about four lines from the commencement.

At fifteen you studied Euclid, and were...", "...rest and change of air restored her health, and in a few weeks she reembarked for St. Louis on the steamer Cincinnati. On their way up they passed by a steamboat tied up and partially wrecked, in charge of three men. It was the Hecla, the boat from which she had landed at Natchez. Then it was that she could see how providential had been the change she had made. The yellow fever had continued its ravages on the unfortunate boat, and on a little island nearby could be seen the graves of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> of its victims. Moreover, the boilers had exploded and several men had been severely injured. At last, after another delay of two weeks, caused by the grounding of the Cincinnati, Mother Duchesne and her companion reached St. Louis, after an absence of five months. The account of this terrible journey contained in Mother Duchesne's letters to Mother Barat is such as might come from the pen of a saint.

He asks that we should submit ourselves to the leadership of the child--his needs, his capacities, his ideal hungers--and in so doing we shall answer many of the most disturbing and difficult problems that perplex our twentieth-century civilization. Even in those states which make the best attempt at educating their children, from three-fourths to nine-tenths, according to the locality, leave the schools at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> or fourteen, and the present quality of the education given from the age of twelve to sixteen is neither an enrichment in culture, nor a training for life and livelihood. It is too brief for culture, and is not intended for vocation.

This fact I have ascertained from an examination of both the skeletons; that of the Gaur in the museum of the Zoological Society, and that of the Gayal, in the possession of Mr. Bartlett, Russell Street, Covent Garden. (See p. 68.) The skeleton of the Gaur just referred to, strikingly confirms Dr. Traill's account of the elevated dorsal ridge of this animal; several of the dorsal vertebrae measuring,...", "...broke down, and the failure was due to Canada.

It was declared that men slept there half the day, having played cards all the night; and dreadful tales were told. Of these tales one-half was doubtless false.

I have tied myself down to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years ago as the time of my story; but I must go back a little beyond this for its first scenes, and work my way up as quickly as may be to the period indicated. I have spoken of a winter in which Herbert Fitzgerald was at home at Castle Richmond, having then completed his Oxford doings; but I must say something of two years previous to that, of a time when Herbert was not so well known in the county as was his cousin of Hap House. It was a thousand pities that a bad word...", "...views and pure morals. In childhood Thomas Lynch Jr. was deprived of his mother by death. At the proper age he was placed at the Indigo Society School at Georgetown, S. C. where some of the most eminent sages of the south were educated.

His progress was rapid and highly gratifying to his anxious father whose only child he was. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> he entered the far famed school at Eton, Buckinghamshire, England, founded by Henry VI. At that school he commenced his classical studios. After completing his course there he was entered as a gentleman commoner in the University of Cambridge where he became a finished scholar and polished gentleman, esteemed and respected by his acquaintances. He then entered the law temple and became well versed in legal knowledge and general science and was well prepared to enter upon the...", "...five and ten feet long respectively, were constructed over the streams on this road to make it passable for the loaded Oak Hill team during term time.

In 1908 the enrollment having reached 115, the seating capacity of the academy was increased by lifting all the seats and adding an additional row of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> double seats to their number. The academy was then painted two coats inside and outside and the woodwork of the old desks was brightened and tinted to correspond with the new ones. These improvements made it look more beautiful and attractive than ever before.

Bright-colored flowers and landscapes, the American eagle, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> stars, representing the original colonies, were also frequently used, as were the queer designs of the funeral urn and weeping willow, that seemed to especially appeal to our ancestors' taste. By the year 1780 American mirror manufacturers had evolved a style peculiarly their own, and the glasses made at that time were known as Constitution mirrors.

The ten nuns of Whitney Priory employed two priests, a waiting maid for the prioress, nine other women servants and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> hinds[421]. It is notable that the maintenance of a larger household than the revenues of the house could support is not infrequently censured in injunctions as responsible for its financial straits. At Nuncoton in 1440 the Prioress said that the house employed more women servants than was necessary[422] and a century later Bishop Longland spoke very sternly against the same fault: that ye streight upon sight herof dymynishe the nombre of your seruants, as well men...", "...the banks, but did not dare to molest so, strong a force as I then commanded.

They planned to walk half the distance that day, sleep at a farmhouse about half-way to the woods, and finish the next day at their destination.

They had hats, of course, but Edith Hillis, in addition, carried a parasol.

Fanny Noble, the principal subject of this memoir, at the time of her captivity, was about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> months old. She was carried by a party of Indians to Montreal. In their attempts to dispose of her, they took her one day to the house of Monsieur Louis St. Auge Charlee, an eminent merchant of that place, who was at that time on a journey to Quebec. His lady was called into the kitchen by one of her maids to see a poor infant crawling on the tile floor in dirt and rags, picking apple peelings out of the cracks. She came in, and on kindly noticing the child, Fanny immediately...", "...at Waterloo. Of all pitched battles, Waterloo is the one which has the smallest front for such a number of combatants.

And, after that, their ships sailed from a wharf in Boston and Captain Jonathan and Captain Jacob had their office on India street. Then the change began in that little city and that wharf. Once, in the long ago, the brig _Industry_ had sailed from Boston for a far country, and little Jacob had gone on that voyage. Little Jacob was Captain Jacob's son and Lois's, and the grandson of Captain Jonathan, and when he went on that voyage he was almost <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years old. And little Sol went, too. He was Captain Solomon's son, and he was only a few months younger than little Jacob. Captain Solomon had taken him in the hope that the voyage would discourage him from going to sea. But, as it turned out, it didn't discourage him at all, but he liked going to sea, so that afterwards he ran away and went to sea, and became the captain of that very ship, as you shall hear. The _Industry_ had been out a little more than a week, and she had...", "...sleeping in the sun. The wrecks don't hit that spot. They hit him, running.

This method of catching pigeons was much the best when they were to be preserved alive. It was rather a late invention in the pigeon-netting business. We have caught with one net in the same way as many as four hundred at one time. With a net set on the ground we have taken from three to five hundred a great many times. In this latter manner, a brother of mine caught 556 with one net.

One is catching out of flocks as they are flying over; the other is catching baited pigeons. One way of bringing the flocks out of the air was by using live pigeons kept for that purpose.

I found likewise, at the depth of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> feet, a vase with two female breasts, two large handles and engravings resembling letters. Among other extremely curious terra-cottas I must also mention three pots with three rows of perforations; they have the usual handle on one side and three feet on the other; also three large vases with perforations right round, on all sides, from the bottom to the top; their use is a riddle to me; can they have served as bee-hives?

Notwithstanding this difference, we find a very striking agreement in the length of the duration of the solar year. In reality, the intercalation of the Mexicans being <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> days on each cycle of fifty-two years, comes to the same thing as that of the Julian calendar, which is one day in four years; and consequently supposes the duration of the year to be three hundred and sixty-five days, six hours.

There were but thirteen in all: and the half of these, as nearly as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> can be divided, were slave States. The fact is, that the South only delayed its vote for the antislavery clause in the ordinance for want of the provision in favor of recovering fugitives from service.

However, under the circumstances it was decided to accept the offer. The transfer of the premises took place in April, 1838.

In December, 1863, the beneficiary was pensioned as his widow at the rate of $20 a month. She received this pension for thirteen years and until 1876, when she married one William G. Culbertson. Thereupon, because of such marriage, her name was dropped from the pension rolls, pursuant to law. In 1889, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years after her remarriage and the termination of her pension, she procured a decree of divorce against her second husband on the ground of desertion.

MURDER OF THE PRINCES IN THE TOWER A.D. 1483 JAMES GAIRDNER The brief reign of Richard III, 1483-1485, left for historians one subject of dispute which even to our own day has not been finally determined--his alleged murder of his nephews, King Edward V and Richard, Duke of York, sons of Edward IV. These princes at the supposed time of their death were about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> and nine years of age respectively. Before his usurpation Richard III, last of the Plantagenet line, was known as the Duke of Gloucester. He served in the Wars of the Roses, and on the death of Edward IV, April, 1483, he seized the young Edward V and caused himself to be proclaimed protector. He then caused his parliament to set the two princes aside as illegitimate, and they were imprisoned in the Tower of London. On June 26, 1483, Richard assumed the crown, and soon after...", "...near Prague. Alas, poor youth! he had studied so much, and yet knew so little.

On the 8th of September, having brought the disease under control at Manila, he insisted on resigning in order to attend to his private affairs, which were suffering from neglect, and his resignation was reluctantly accepted.

The cost of enlargement was L110, which, with a debt remaining on the house, was in the spring of 1837 entirely defrayed by the united efforts of the friends.

He was succeeded by Mr. G. Nettleship, who, after labouring <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years and a half in another situation in Cumberland, accepted now the united invitation of this Church and congregation to become their pastor. Mr. Nettleship commenced his stated labours here on the 18th of June, 1837, and removed from Yelvertoft in the year 1846, when he was shortly after succeeded by the Rev.

During the three years spent at Elmwood, exploring and surveying journeys were frequent in the mild seasons, and the arduous nature of the work done is well shown in the account of the last two journeys undertaken prior to returning to England.

From the start they had to face stormy weather, while the snow was both deep and soft, and the ice rough and treacherous. After a fortnight's travelling, during which they came upon a hitherto undiscovered headland and fjord, they rounded the north-eastern extremity of the western land.

In his view it was of binding force and authoritative. This contained the four gospels, the Acts, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> epistles of Paul, the first epistle of John, and the Revelation. He had also a sort of appendix or deutero-canon, which he highly esteemed without putting it on a par with the received collection, consisting of John's second epistle, the first of Peter, and the Shepherd of Hermas.

In the first place the country was really weak. The military strength of the American Union in 1780 was inferior to that of Holland, and about on a level with that of Denmark or Portugal. But furthermore the want of union made it hard to bring out such strength as there was. In the autumn of 1777 the Articles of Confederation were submitted to the several states for adoption; but the spring of 1781 had arrived before all the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> states had ratified them. These articles left the Continental Congress just what it was before, a mere advisory body, without power to enlist soldiers or levy taxes, without federal courts or federal officials, and with no executive head to the government.

This was always a very slow way to get money, and now the...", "...in several fields of labor.

Many hundred years previously Galen had originated a method, which deserves, perhaps, the title of pure eclecticism. The first purely eclectic system similar to his originated with Boerhaave (1688-1738), perhaps the most famous physician of his or any other century. He was the son of a clergyman near Leyden, Holland, and was one of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> children. Originally intended for the clerical profession, he had studied philosophy, history, logic, metaphysics, philology, mathematics, as well as theology, with great diligence. His education was, later, directed to the study of medicine, because of the statement that the purity of certain theological doctrines was endangered by him. So he studied chemistry and botany, and then anatomy and medicine,{194} graduating in 1693. He practiced in Leyden with great success, and...", "...that you're going to make me a present right away of a couple of million dollars.\" Mr. Chauncey van Rensselaer bounced slightly in his chair, and his eyes were very wide open. \"Two millions, at least,\" reiterated Robbie, seeing that he was speechless. \"And _give_ it, not lend it.

Being the principal and initial sign, Coslahuntax represented in himself the period of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> days.\" As Dr. Brinton rightly notes(45) the name of the personage should be Oxlaghun tax, literally signifying \"the thirteen divisions or parts.\" We thus see that, whilst the names of the chiefs of the four quarters constituted the four major calendar-signs, one supreme lord embodied the attributes or \"powers\" of the 13 divisions of warriors and principal division. Thus the 13 divisions seem to have been regarded as 12 plus an all-embracing 1.

I have recommended that he should be left alone this morning, that the effect which I hope to produce upon him may have greater power.\" \"And what is his madness, sir?\" whispered Madame George to the doctor, so as not to be heard by Louise. \"He imagines that if he does not earn <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> hundred francs in his day's work, to pay a debt contracted with a notary named Jacques Ferrand, Louise will die on the scaffold for the crime of infanticide.\" \"Oh! sir, that notary was a monster!\" cried Madame George, informed of the hatred of this man against Germain. \"Louise Morel and her father are not his only victims; he has persecuted my son with undying animosity.\" \"Louise Morel has told me all, madame,\" answered the doctor. \"God's mercy! this wretch has ceased to...", "...is so close by that one uninspired might almost see it. In truth, the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods, most strangely making the difficult easy, and the easy difficult.\" It was a wise head. A peasant's cap was no safe disguise for it; you could know it for a king's under a diving-bell, if you could hear it work its intellect. I had a new trade now, and plenty of business in it. The king was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen during the next <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> centuries as if he were expecting to live in them. From that time out, I prophesied myself bald-headed trying to supply the demand. I have done some indiscreet things in my day, but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the worst. Still, it had its ameliorations. A prophet doesn't have to have any brains. They are good to have, of course, for the ordinary exigencies of life, but they are no use in professional work. It is the restfulest vocation there is. When...", "...reign of William and Mary, and the person who was tried and condemned by a Court Martial for falling asleep on his duty upon the terrace at Windsor. He absolutely denied the charge against him, and solemnly declared that he heard St. Paul's clock strike thirteen, the truth of which was much doubted by the court because of the great distance. But whilst he was under sentence of death, an affidavit was made by several persons that the clock actually did strike <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> instead of twelve; whereupon he received his majesty's pardon. The above his friends caused to be engraved upon his plate, to satisfy the world of the truth of a story which has been much doubted, though he had often confirmed it to many gentlemen, and a few days before his death told it to several of his neighbours. He enjoyed his sight and memory to the day of his death.\"] _Defence of the Execution of Mary Queen of Scots_ (Vol. iii., p....", "...canals, cleansing the beds of rivers, assisting in harvest, and in FORMING and MENDING the ROADS: _these hewers of wood and drawers of water_ would be a corps of reserve against any emergency.

An act was obtained, in 1767, to open a cut between Birmingham and the coal delphs about Wednesbury. The necessary article of coal, before this act, was brought by land, at about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> shillings per ton, but now at seven. It was common to see a train of carriages for miles, to the great destruction of the road, and the annoyance of travellers.

Among the public and private paintings at Florence, the chapel Corsini and the gallery Riccardi are by the hand of Luca; nor was he unemployed by the Sovereign; and Cosmo III., in whose presence he invented and coloured a large composition with momentary velocity, declared him a painter formed for princes. He obtained the same praise from Charles II. of Spain, whom he served for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years, but from the multitude of his works might be supposed to have served during a long life. There he continued the series of pictures begun by Cambiasi, in the church of the Escurial, on the most extensive plan, but inferior in style and execution to the frescoes of Buon-Ritiro. Of his oil pictures, that of the Nativity, for the Queen Mother, has shared unlimited praise, as combining with superior felicity of execution, a research and a depth of study seldom found in his...", "...and profiting in their turn from such free teaching as the Grammar School and the college lecturers might afford. The system, however, was already justified to some extent by the fact that among the pupils of the President were numbered Bodley, Camden, Lyly and Florio.

The poor scholars were in future not to be more than thirteen in number, and were to be attached to the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> senior fellows. Before long, however, the matriculations of non-foundationers began to increase very rapidly. A new block of buildings even was erected near the Cherwell for their accommodation by 1636.

Why traditional? For the reason that most of them, and all, except the three last, are not real or historical characters. Commencing with Nero, about the time when the tradition commences, and coming down to, and including Commodus, cotemporary with Eleutherus, there are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> emperors, one more than the number of Bishops in the same time, and history gives the time when each was born, when each became a ruler, when each ceased to reign, the manner of his death, and the qualities for which each was distinguished. It was an age of chronology, when dates of important events were as carefully preserved as in our own day; and yet Irenaeus has failed to give a single date in connection with his twelve traditional Bishops. We do not even know there was...", "...of the Honourable Mrs. Cheffington, she could not undertake to keep May any longer; feeling sure, by repeated experience, that all applications for payment made to Captain Cheffington would be in vain, and understanding that Mrs. Dormer-Smith declined to charge herself with her niece's education. Captain Cheffington had been violently angry, and had denounced the schoolmistress--Mrs. Drax--as an insolent, grasping, vulgar harpy. But Mrs. Drax was out of his reach, and there was May, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> years old, with a healthy appetite, and limbs rapidly outgrowing her clothes. Augustus continued to glare moodily at the square for some minutes. His sister leaned her cheek on her hand, and looked at the fire.

They caught four armadilloes, they are much larger than our hedge-hogs, and very like them; their bodies are cased all over with shells, shutting under one another like shells of armour.

It is said that when the first brick house was built in the village she made a point of learning how to make bricks, turning them up, piling them on the wheelbarrow, and putting them in the kiln. She was always hungry to know and to do, and the harder a thing was the more she seemed to like it. Climbing was ever more fun than trudging along on the level. The years brought changes to the home farm. The older sisters married and went to homes of their own. When Mary was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirteen</span> her mother married again and went away with the younger children, leaving her to keep house for the only brother, who had from early childhood been her best comrade. The dollar a week given her for her work was saved to pay for a term in the neighboring academy. She also taught in a district school for a while, receiving seventy-five cents a week and board.
