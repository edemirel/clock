The funds employed in paying for service would not be increased a single farthing; and, therefore, by the destruction of bells, all the families of the kingdom would have some work left undone, to make up for the additional labour required through the want of this useful contrivance: or all the servants in the kingdom would be more hardly worked,--would have to work <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hours a day instead of twelve.

This advance met the head of Lee's column near Farmville, which it heroically attacked and detained until General Read was killed and his small force overpowered. This caused a delay in the enemy's movements, and enabled General Ord to get well up with the remainder of his force, on meeting which, the enemy immediately intrenched himself. In the afternoon, General Sheridan struck the enemy south of Sailors' Creek, captured <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> pieces of artillery and about four hundred wagons, and detained him until the 6th corps got up, when a general attack of infantry and cavalry was made, which resulted in the capture of six or seven thousand prisoners, among whom were many general officers.

She was immediately involved in all the excitements of parties, and balls, and gorgeous entertainments.

It was a dangerous scene into which to introduce the artless and inexperienced Creole...", "...thirty years the falls were unvisited, but in 1891 an expedition was made to them, and they have been since again visited. The cataract is described as a magnificent spectacle, the river with full flow leaping from a rocky platform into a huge chasm, with a roar that can be heard twenty miles and an immense column of rainbow-illumined spray. The plunge is made after descending rapids for eight hundred feet, and is over a precipice two hundred feet wide, the fall being three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet.

For the <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> miles the tail of one rapid generally runs right into the head of the next, and there is a fall of two hundred and sixty feet, or more than sixteen feet to the mile. For the last five miles there is less white water, but the current runs from eight to twelve miles an hour, with many swirls and whirlpools. The river is closely canyoned all the way.

The part he had taken in Lucy Haines' benefit had also had its share in his development. Strange to say, the extent of Jerry's musical attainments had proved a surprise, even to the people who had known him from babyhood, and he had received more compliments since that occasion than had fallen to his lot in his previous <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years of existence.

He paused, as we have seen, at Rimini, and he paused again, and for a rather longer spell, at Forli, so that it was not until the second week of November that Astorre Manfredi--the boy of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> who was to hold Faenza--caught in the distance the flash of arms and the banners with the bull device borne by the host which the Duke of Valentinois led against him. At first it had been Astorre's intent to follow the examples set him by Malatesta and Sforza, and he had already gone so far as to remove his valuables to Ravenna, whither he, too, meant to seek refuge.

With two employees, it is no longer necessary for the housewife to remain at home while one is off duty, even for an hour, for one relieves the other without any cessation of work.

From <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> to eighteen he resided at home, and was left to his own devices.

In Jeffery's counter (Fig. 207), each subdivision has an area of 1 square centimetre; in Pakes' counter (Fig. 208), radii divide the circle into <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> equal sectors, and counting is facilitated by concentric circles equidistant from the centre.

When the hour of battle arrived, these two and the sailing master, and a number of raw midshipmen, were the only line-officers left, and two French officers of marines.

(1) The pause at the end of the present Fourth Act is far from 'faulty,' as Spedding alleges it to be; that Act ends with the most melting scene Shakespeare ever wrote; and a pause after it, and before the business of the battle, was perfectly right. (2) The Fourth Act is already much longer than the Fifth (about fourteen columns of the Globe edition against about eight and a half), and Spedding's change would give the Fourth nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> columns, and the Fifth less than seven. (3) Spedding's proposal requires a much greater alteration in the existing text than he supposed. It does not simply shift the division of the two Acts, it requires the disappearance and re-entrance of the blind Gloster.

I, for my part, know them; but, considering their feeble number, I keep asking myself what part they play in a harem so disproportionate to their forces. A few figures will show us what my hesitations are based upon. In twenty-two Osmia cocoons (Osmia tricornis), the total census of the inmates yields three hundred and fifty-four, of whom forty-seven are males and three hundred and seven females. The average number of inmates, therefore, is <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> individuals; and there are six females at least to one male. This disparity is maintained, in more or less marked proportions, whatever the species of the bee invaded. In the cocoons of the Mason bee of the Sheds, I discover the average proportion to be six females to one male; in those of the Mason bee of the Walls, I find one male to fifteen females. These facts, which I am unable to state with any greater precision, are enough to give rise to the suspicion that the males,...", "...without.

He was <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years old, and having got a good situation as gardener in Cheshire was bidding farewell that day to home and parents, and about to face the world alone. His mother had begged him to promise to do whatsoever she asked, and he had hesitated, wishing to know first what it was that she wanted. At last, however, remembering how good and loving she had always been, he had consented. Her request was a very simple one, but it was very far reaching. \"I only ask whether you will...", "...advanced age, leaving a fortune of more than thirty millions of piastres and immense quantities of valuables.

The land on the two sides of the fault moved a short distance in opposite directions. Thus in some straight fences and roads crossing the fault, one section was found to be shifted as much as <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet to one side of the other. The severe vibrations set up by this break and shifting extended a long distance in all directions.

Whatever may be said of the incurrence of sunstroke in the Army, though he fixes it as after the date of his only medical treatment during his service, and whatever may be said of the continuance of vertigo consequent upon the sunstroke for <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years, I find no proof that at the time he fell he was afflicted with vertigo, unless it be his own statement; and whatever disability naturally arose from sunstroke does not appear by him to have been deemed sufficient to induce him to apply for a pension previous to his fall. In any event there seems to be no satisfactory evidence that anything which occurred in his army service was the cause of his fall and consequent injury. GROVER CLEVELAND.

The next day the miserable man was ordered to work, but he lacked the strength, had he been willing, for he was weak from starvation and pain, and stiffened by the irons. And now the climax came. The jailer seized a tarred rope and beat him till it broke; then, foaming with fury, he dragged the old man down stairs, and, with a new rope, gave him ninety-seven blows, when his strength failed; and Brend, his flesh black and beaten to...", "...with a smile of utter trustfulness; and she whispered: \"Married this morning, Paul! . . . So you can understand that my load of happiness is not yet very heavy.\" There was a movement among the crowd. Everybody gathered around the exit. A general officer, accompanied by two aides-de-camp, stepped out into the station-yard, where a motor-car stood waiting for him. The strains were heard of a military band; a battalion of light infantry marched down the road. Next came a team of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> horses, driven by artillery-men and dragging an enormous siege-piece which, in spite of the weight of its carriage, looked light, because of the extreme length of the gun. A herd of bullocks followed. Paul, who was unable to find a porter, was standing on the pavement, carrying the two traveling-bags, when a man in leather gaiters, green velveteen breeches and a shooting-jacket with horn buttons, came up to him and raised his cap: \"M. Paul Delroze?\" he said. \"I am the...", "...not go round and release the poor man; you would be seen.\" \"Yes; it was a foolish idea. But something may suggest itself. Oh, I can't bear to think about the poor man.\" \"If you go, I go too,\" said Tommy. \"I won't leave you.\" The two set off, and felt their way stumblingly through the passage. Presently they were aware of a pungent aromatic smell, that increased as they went on. This was explained when they reached the opening in the wall; looking over stealthily, they saw, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> or twenty feet below them, on the floor of the cave, a strange bewildering sight. A ring of dusky men held aloft great flaring torches which gave out a heavy smoke that penetrated into the tunnel. Without the circle there stood a row of drummers beating a rhythmic music on their instruments; within, a crowd of men were leaping in wild gyrations, uttering frenzied yells. In the haze nothing could be seen distinctly; all was a confused whirl. The prisoner was quite...", "...or regret, but I could never think of the sunlit Alps or leafy boulevards without an irresistible longing to throw reputation to the winds and return to them forthwith! The other circumstance connected with Tiriak-Hureya is that the _povarnia_, measuring exactly sixteen feet by fourteen feet, was already tenanted by a venerable gentleman of ragged and unsavoury exterior, his Yakute wife, or female companion, three children, and a baby with a mysterious skin disease.

But just how economies were actually to be effected was not so clear. For months Gallatin had been toiling over masses of statistics, trying to reconcile a policy of reduced taxation, to satisfy the demands of the party, with the discharge of the public debt. By laborious calculation he found that if $7,300,000 were set aside each year, the debt--principal and interest--could be discharged within <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years. But if the unpopular excise were abandoned, where was the needed revenue to be found? New taxes were not to be thought of. The alternative, then, was to reduce expenditures. But how and where? Under these circumstances the President and his Cabinet adopted the course which in the light of subsequent events seems to have been woefully ill-timed and hazardous in the extreme. They determined to sacrifice the army and navy. In extenuation of this decision, it may be said...", "...watercarrier, or good mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

But exercise and a special aptitude for it enable some men to walk great distances in a relatively short space of time. Trained walkers have gone seventy-five miles in twenty hours, and walked the distance of thirty-seven miles at the rate of five miles an hour. The mountaineers of the Alps are generally good walkers, and some of them are not less remarkable for endurance than for speed.

The reason for this is deeper than the mere fact of sex. It is imbedded in the social life and customs of the people. A girl remains at home until she is <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> or seventeen, during which time she is little more than an expense. She is then taken to her husband's home and her own family have no further control over her life or conduct. She loses her identity with her own family, and becomes part of that of her husband.

A ride of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> miles brought them, in the afternoon, in sight of the Crow camp. It was composed of leathern tents, pitched in a meadow on the border of a small clear stream at the foot of the mountain. A great number of horses were grazing in the vicinity, many of them doubtless captured in marauding excursions. The Crow chieftain came forth to meet his guests with great professions of friendship, and conducted them to his tents, pointing out, by the way, a convenient place where they might...", "...of Cibyra, Apamea and Synnada, which were added to Cilicia in Cicero's time (between 56 and 50 B.C.).

Where each leaf joins the stem a flower-stalk rises, and in the Dog's Mercury there are two kinds of flowers. On one stalk you find groups of small flowers clustered at close intervals round the stalk. Each of these flowers has three broadly pointed green sepals, which curl slightly at the tips. In the centre of these sepals rises a large bunch of eight to <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> yellow-headed stamens. In these flowers there are no petals, and no seed-vessel. But you will find different flowers on another plant. These flowers have also three green sepals, and are without petals.

The life of this unfortunate _Maestro_, says the _Athenaeum_, would be a curious rather than a pleasing story, were it thoroughly written. He was educated at the _Conservatorio de la Pieta_ of Naples, and began his career when seventeen years of age, as the composer of an opera, _I Puntigli delle Donne_.

In 1803, Spontini went to Paris, in which capital again he produced some half-a-dozen operas and an oratorio,--all of which have perished.

The German Reichstags regularly had from twelve to <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> different parties, and even then there were generally two or three delegates who found themselves unable to agree with the tenets of any one of these parties and remained unattached, the \"wild delegates\" (_die Wilden_), as they were termed.

The residence in London continued for a number of years; and resulted in giving the Colonel a new wife in the person of a rich young widow, and in giving social finish and a broken heart to Evelyn Byrd. Under the guidance of her father, she was educated after the manner of the fashionable life of that day. It must have been a time quite to the elegant Colonel's liking when London turned in admiration to his daughter; when, but <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> and already crowned with social successes, the cultured beauty from the plantation on the James was presented at the English Court. The stories of Evelyn Byrd's London experiences bring many noted names into the train of those who did her honour: the Lords Chesterfield and Oxford, and Pope at the height of his glory, and the cynical Lord Hervey, and Beau Nash, the autocrat of Bath. There should be mentioned too that old courtier (whoever he was) whose admiration was...", "...did not know how sixteen thousand francs would look. How beautiful gold is! Just look, wife.\" But Colette turned her head away. She was quite as covetous as her husband, and perhaps even more excited; but she was a woman, and she knew how to dissemble. \"Ah, my dear young lady!\" she said, \"never would my old man and myself have asked you for money, if we had only ourselves to think of. But we have children.\" \"Your duty is to think of your children,\" replied Dionysia. \"I know <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> thousand francs is a big sum. Perhaps you will be sorry to give us so much money.\" \"I am not sorry at all: I would even add to it willingly.\" And she showed them one of the other four rolls in her bag. \"Then, to be sure, what do I care for my place!\" cried Blangin. And, intoxicated by the sight and the touch of the gold, he added,-- \"You are at home here, madam; and the jail and the jailer are at your disposal. What do you desire? Just speak. I have nine prisoners, not...", "...of coffee cultivation into the neighbouring tract of Manjarabad, also in Mysore, and into the Wynaad subdivision of the Madras district of Malabar. From 1840 to 1860 the enterprise made slow progress; but since the latter date it has spread with great rapidity along the whole line of the Western Ghats, clearing away the primeval forest, and opening a new era of prosperity to the labouring classes. The export of coffee in 1905 was 360,000 cwt., being the highest for <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years. The over-supply of cheap Brazilian coffee in the consuming markets caused a heavy fall in prices at the beginning of the decade, the average price in London in 1901 being 47s. per cwt. compared with 101s. in 1894. The United Kingdom and France are the chief consumers. An agreement with France at the beginning of the decade secured to Indian produce imported into that country the benefits of the minimum tariff, thus protecting the coffee industry from...", "...having the Duke and Duchess of Fife (Princess Royal) on board.

The sea is high and dead against us, and the wind is so strong that we can hardly go up on deck. It becomes steadily cooler as we advance northwards. To the east we have now the large island of Formosa, which was annexed by Japan <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years ago. It is about twice the size of Wales, and marks the boundary between the China Sea and the Eastern Sea, which farther north passes into the Yellow Sea. The coast and its hills are sometimes seen close at hand, sometimes far off, and sometimes they disappear in the distance. With a glass we can distinguish the lighthouses, always erected on small islands off the mainland. The Chinese coast is dangerous, being full of reefs, holms, and shallows. Hong Kong and the...", "...prides and local antagonisms, its more or less definite and sharp-cut national consciousness. From the amorphous mass of protoplasm, so to speak, of 1808, each part of which was generally similar to every other part, there had emerged sixteen separate organisms, some markedly different and no two alike, although those distinctive features which make up national character had become much more fully developed in some than in others. That is to say, there are now instead of one people <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> new nations. But can we describe these sixteen republics as Nations? What is a Nation? It is dangerous to offer a definition which may not correspond to usage, for usage is the only true master and interpreter of words; and usage is in this case loose and varying. But it might be not far wide of the mark to say that while a nationality is a population held together by certain ties, as, for example, language and literature, ideas, customs, and traditions, in such wise as...", "...which it required a cheerful and energetic mind to sustain,--that of a family devoid of principle. Among the five sons of Macgregor, Coll, James, Robert, Duncan, and Ronald, four were known to be but too worthy of the name given by the enemies of the Macgregors to the individuals of that tribe--\"devils.\" Of Coll, the eldest, little is ascertained. Robert, or Robbiq, or the younger, as the Gaelic word signifies, inherited all the fierceness, without the generosity, of his race. At <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years of age, he deliberately shot at a man of the name of Maclaren, and wounded him so severely that he died. His brothers were implicated in this murder. On their trials, they were charged with being not only murderers, but notorious thieves and receivers of stolen goods. Robert was proved to have boasted of having drawn the first blood of the Maclarens; and the brothers were all accused of having followed this murder by houghing and killing forty head of young cattle...", "...the \"king of love,\" he said to him: \"There are no other kings in Scotland save me and you; I take heed to myself, do you likewise.\" But the king of love had nothing to fear. During the night of the 20th of February, 1437, an unwonted noise was suddenly heard in the courtyard of the monastery of Perth where James lodged; it was Robert Graham and his rebel band. Vainly did the king offer resistance, though unarmed; the foe were too numerous, and they stretched him dead, pierced with <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> sword wounds. The constant love of the king for Jane Beaufort had been celebrated by himself in an allegorical poem, imitated from Chaucer: \"The King's Quhair,\" a poem all aglow with bright hues and with the freshness of youth.[848] The prince is in bed at night, and, like Chaucer in his poem of the Duchess, unable to sleep, he takes up a book. It is the \"Consolation\" of Boethius, and the meditations of \"that noble senatoure\" who had also known great reverses, occupied his...", "...hang one at the mouth of every ravine as a warning to the gang.

Now, this morning two urgent messages were sent me from two different points more than <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> miles apart, to say that there were signs of a descent of the tribes. Elliott, with one gun and the Sowars, went to the farther ravine, while I, with the infantry, hurried to the other, but we found it was a false alarm. I saw no signs of the Hillmen, and though we were greeted by a splutter of jezail bullets we were unable to capture any of the rascals. Woe betide them if they fall into my hands. I would give them as short a shrift as ever a Highland cateran got from a...", "...by the enemy in vastly superior numbers. The Germans fought with great bravery and several times charged the Americans and drove them back. Fresh troops continued to come up on the enemy's side, and the Germans, having lost a large number of men, including their colonel, were forced to retreat into the woods. The enemy then advanced against Colonel Breyman, who was ignorant of the disaster that had befallen Baum, and with his detachment had occupied twenty-four hours in marching <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> miles. The Germans again fought well, but after a gallant resistance were obliged to fall back. In these two affairs they lost six hundred men. In the meantime Colonel St. Leger had commenced his attack upon Fort Stanwix, which was defended by seven hundred men. The American General Herkimer advanced with one thousand men to its relief. Colonel St. Leger detached Sir John Johnson with a party of regulars and a number of Indians, who had accompanied him, to meet them. The...", "...to stroll, to see the play, to watch each other.

Amongst the <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> subjugated personages are two women and above each are hieroglyphs expressing the names of well-known localities, some of which are mentioned in native chronicles as having been conquered in historical times by Mexican rulers. In my account of the Plan of the Ancient City of Mexico, I shall illustrate these hieroglyphs, locate the places to which they refer and further discuss this monument. Meanwhile I shall but state that it undoubtedly belongs to the same category of...", "...measure, however expedient he may think it; but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional, if, at the same time, he deems it inexpedient. It therefore would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition as having done so because, in their understanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory. The remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> of the \"thirty-nine,\" so far as I have discovered, have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of Federal control on slavery in the Federal Territories. But there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their twenty-three compeers, had it been manifested at all. For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been...", "...stopped him up into a _Hole_ where they after found him.

It was the same exquisite face; the soft, dark eyes, the transparent complexion, the pure features. Perhaps I have dwelt more than I ought on this boy's beauty; but he is no imaginary creation; and it was of that rare order that enchains the eye and almost enforces mention whenever seen, no matter how often.

In November 1690 it was calculated that during the preceding <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> months about 140,000 oz. had been exported. In addition to this actual drain of coinage, the processes of culling, clipping, and counterfeiting, which had been going on through the reigns of Charles II. and James II., had resulted in an unexampled depreciation of so much of the coinage as remained. A large portion of the currency consisted of iron, brass, or copper-pieces plated, and such coins as were of good silver were worth scarcely one-half their current value.

It proved to be the embouchure of what is now known as the River Tamar, on which Launceston, the second town of the island, is built. The discoverers sailed up the estuary, following its course for many miles inland. It was found to be alive with aquatic fowls, particularly black swans, sometimes numbering 500 in a flock. This unexpected diversion proved rich sport, and afforded a pleasant interlude to the monotony of life at sea. But the expedition was...", "...heals the wound that truth only irritates.

James Orkney, Esquire, M.L.A. for West Melbourne, had a small steamer of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> tons, built by himself from a model of the Great Eastern, which was quite ready for sea; and having also a captain willing to embark in her, he undertook to send her round to the Gulf of Carpentaria at his own charge.

The United States Navy, during the six months' period covered in this chapter, fared comparatively well, in spite of the fact that large forces were engaged in patrol duty in European waters and many transports crossed from the States to Europe and vice versa. Of the latter only one was lost. On October 17, 1917, the _Antilles_ while returning to the United States was torpedoed and sunk. Of those on board sixty-seven were drowned, including <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> soldiers. The United States destroyer _Cassin_ had an encounter with a German submarine on October 16, 1917. Though struck by a torpedo, she was not seriously damaged and made port safely, after having first attempted, until night broke, to discover her attacker, without succeeding, however. The patrol boat _Alcedo_, formerly a steam yacht, belonging to G. W. C. Drexel of Philadelphia, was torpedoed and sunk on November 5, 1917. She was the first fighting unit of the...", "...stands out also in a very singular individuality. Percy Bysshe Shelley was born on the 4th of August, 1792, at Fieldplace, in Sussex, England. He was the eldest son of Sir Timothy Shelley, and of an ancient family, traced back, it is said, to Sir Philip Sidney. When thirteen years old he was sent to Eton, where he began to display his revolutionary tendencies by his resistance to the fagging system; and where he also gave some earnest in writing of his future powers. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> he entered University College, Oxford, and appeared as a radical in most social, political, and religious questions. On account of a paper entitled _The Necessity of Atheism_, he was expelled from the university and went to London. In 1811 he made a runaway match with Miss Harriet Westbrook, the daughter of the keeper of a coffee-house, which brought down on him the wrath of his father. After the birth of two children, a separation followed; and he eloped with Miss Godwin in...", "...LAC QUI PARLE, Sept. 25, 1862. \"Colonel: [After speaking of a variety of matters concerning the disposition of troops who were in my command, the battle of Wood Lake (which he characterized as \"A smart conflict we had with the Indians\"), the rescue of the prisoners and other matters, he adds:] \"N.

The white man's burden in the east had been upon brown and yellow shoulders for over <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years now, and the Indians and Burmese and Indonesians were ruling themselves, after their fling at communism in the fifties. The initial bitterness which followed the debacle of 1955 had passed, we were glad to see. Porters no longer spat in the faces of white men.

With reference to these problems Dr. Abbott occupies a position similar to that of Boucher de Perthes in the Old World, and the Trenton valley is coming to be classic ground, like the valley of the Somme. In April, 1873, Dr. Abbott published his description of three rude implements which he had found some <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet below the surface of the ground \"in the gravels of a bluff overlooking the Delaware river.\" The implements were in place in an undisturbed deposit, and could not have found their way thither in any recent time; Dr. Abbott assigned them to the age of the Glacial drift.

In 1232, however, young Simon came to England to attempt the recovery of his mother's inheritance, and his graceful manners and Southern tongue at once delighted Henry III. Another heart was at the same time gained; the King's sister, Eleanor, who had been left a widow at <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> by the death of the brave Earl of Pembroke, had, in her first despair, made a vow of perpetual widowhood, and received the ring of dedication from the Archbishop; but at the end of six years all this was forgotten; she fell in love with the handsome Provencal, and prevailed on the King to sanction with his presence a hasty private wedding in St. Stephen's Chapel.

By turning his head slightly he could have looked across the sunlit surface of Buttermilk Channel to the green slopes...", "...of vessels built by them. I feel, therefore, that certain misinformed authors should, in the interests of the truth, correct their statements if they issue new editions of their work or write further on the development of the submarine. During the years of practical experimental work with the _Argonaut_, Mr. Holland continued in his efforts to get the _Plunger_--building under the 1893 appropriation--in shape for submerged trials, but without success. The large steam installation, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hundred horsepower, was largely responsible for this. As I remember, there was only about eighteen inches between the main engines, with large steam supply and exhaust pipes overhead and under foot. These engines were designed to run at over four hundred revolutions per minute. The boiler was located nearly in the centre of the vessel and so nearly filled the ship that there was barely room between the top of the boiler and ship to creep from \"forward to aft.\" [Illustration:...", "...food.\" Standing for a minute in a reflective mood, the man with the red beard addressed the Prince in a slow, meditative manner: \"How would you like,\" he said, \"to form a nucleus?\" \"Can we get any thing to eat by it?\" eagerly asked the Prince. \"Yes,\" replied the man, \"you can.\" \"We'll do it!\" immediately cried the whole sixteen, without waiting for further information. \"Which will you do first,\" said the man, \"listen to my explanations, or eat?\" \"Eat!\" cried the entire <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> in chorus. The man now produced from his cart a quantity of bread, meat, wine, and other provisions, which he distributed generously, but judiciously, to the hungry Prince and his followers. Every one had enough, but no one too much. And soon, revived and strengthened, they felt like new beings. \"Now,\" said the Prince, \"we are ready to form a nucleus, as we promised. How is it done?\" \"I will explain the matter to you in a few words,\" said the man with the red beard....", "...leaves very few, succulent, and tender; stalk short; quality tender, mild, and well flavored.

When fully grown, the four outside or lower leaves are about <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> inches in diameter; and, when taken off and spread out, their general outline is nearly circular. The stem is dwarfish, and the leaf-stalks come out quite close to each other; so that scarcely any portion of the stem is to be seen between them. The whole cabbage measures about three feet in circumference. The heart is shortly conical, with a broad base; near which it is about two feet in circumference, when divested of the outside leaves. The ribs boil tender. It is one of...", "...backward or sidewise, \"crab-fashion,\" as forward. They are of various colors and markings, often so patterned as to harmonize very perfectly with the general color and appearance of the rocks and sea-weeds among which they live. The spider-crabs are especially strange-looking creatures with unusually long and slender legs and a comparatively small body-trunk. They include the _Macrocheira_ of Japan, the largest of the crustaceans. Specimens of this crab are known measuring twelve to <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet from tip to tip of extended legs; the carapace is only as many inches in width or length. The soft-shelled crab is a species common along our Atlantic coast. It is \"soft-shelled\" only at the time of molting, and has to be caught in the few days intervening between the shedding of the old hard shell and the hardening of the new body-wall. The little oyster-crabs (_Pinnotheres_) which live with the live oyster in the cavity enclosed by the oyster shell are well-known and...", "...the horse he thought might win. Neptune was by Seahorse, and his dam, La Perouse, was one of Jim's best mares. He was a grey, a beautiful colour, and uncommon in race-horses. 'There are not many good greys,' said Jim; 'but once you do get a good one that colour he is generally an out and outer.' He thought this description applied to Neptune, whose fault was that he inherited a good deal of the temper his sire displayed on a memorable occasion at Wanabeen. The grey stood <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hands high, or a shade over, and was powerfully built, and no fault could be found with his shape in any respect. He was fast as the wind, and, moreover, could stay, and was sound in wind and limb. If carefully handled he seldom displayed much temper, but it was in him all the same, and great caution had to be exercised to keep it in check. Neptune had taken a great fancy to Willie, and the lad could do almost anything with him. It gladdened Jim Dennis's heart to see his...", "...of Isla, Sir Archibald Forbes, and a few other knights and barons assembled with 30,000 fighting men, besides camp followers and servants. It was a small force indeed to meet the great army which was advancing against it, and in cavalry in particular it was extremely weak.

Each army had stirring memories to inspire it, for the English in their march crossed over the field of Falkirk, where <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years before they had crushed the stubborn squares of Wallace; while from the spot which Bruce selected as his battleground could be seen the Abbey Craig, overlooking the scene of the Scottish victory of Stirling Bridge.

It was an unpainted square cottage and stood bare on the sod at the edge of Dry Run ravine. It had a small lean-to on the eastern side and a sitting room and bedroom below. Overhead was a low unplastered chamber in which we children slept. As it grew too cold to use the summer kitchen we cooked, ate and lived in the square room which occupied the entire front of the two story upright, and which was, I suppose, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet square. As our attic was warmed only by the stove-pipe, we older children of a frosty morning made extremely simple and hurried toilets. On very cold days we hurried down stairs to dress beside the kitchen fire. Our furniture was of the rudest sort.

Otherwise we should not certainly know that it lasted more than some six or eight months. About the two subsequent periods of our Lord's ministry we shall find no room to question that each lasted six months; but _here_ we have to admit much uncertainty as to the time. After all, a determination of the time employed would be a matter of very little importance to our study of this period. But the immense amount of...", "...head broken.

The climate is extremely mild, high hills sheltering the whole region from north and east winds, and the Arran mountains, intervening some <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> miles over the sea to the west, collect much of the rain. Hence, although near some very rainy districts, the Seamill neighbourhood is peculiarly sunny and dry.

In a small house about two miles from Bessie's home lived a very old lady. She loved the Lord and enjoyed telling of his goodness and of his dealings with her. Bessie, who was now about <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years of age, enjoyed these talks very much. One day while Bessie and her mother were visiting this aged saint, she brought forth a much-worn paper and handed it to Mrs. Worthington, saying, \"My daughter sent me this paper.

To give to this collection that variety which is the spice of a magazine's life, the editor has selected a single contribution from each of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> characteristic _Atlantic_ authors, making his choice from material not greatly affected by the interests of the moment. In two or three instances appears an essay which has already been published in some collection of an author's work, and the _Atlantic_ wishes to acknowledge with thanks permission from Houghton Mifflin Company to print once again Professor Sharp's delightful \"Turtle Eggs for Agassiz,\" which has been included in his volume \"The Face of the Fields,\" and Mr....", "...and in this \"undeniable situation,\" as George Robins would say, stood a snug public house, called Sawney's Cross; the front of which commanded a view, across the high road, for some distance up the lanes which led to the market town and common.

I saw her first five years ago at Gerard's; she came from Switzerland, where she had taken refuge.\" The Princesse Belgiojoso had her early education entrusted to men of broad learning whose political views were opposed to Austria. She was reared in Milan in the home of her young step-father, who had been connected with the _Conciliatore_. His home was the rendezvous of the artistic and literary celebrities of the day; but beneath the surface lay conspiracy. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> she was married to her fellow townsman, the rich, handsome, pleasure-loving, musical Prince Belgiojoso, but the union was an unhappy one. Extremely patriotic, she plunged into conspiracy. In 1831, she went to Paris, opened a salon and mingled in politics, meeting the great men of the age, many of whom fell in love with her. Her salon was filled with people famous for wit, learning and beauty, equaling that of Madame Recamier; Balzac was among the number. If Madame de...", "...Medici refused to take steps against Coligny, who was formally accused by the duchess of Guise and her brothers-in-law of having incited the murder. In 1566 she insisted on a formal reconciliation at Moulins between the Guises and Coligny, at which, however, none of the sons of the murdered man was present. Henry and his brothers were, however, compelled in 1572 to sign an ambiguous assent to this agreement. Guise's widow married James of Savoy, duke of Nemours, and the young duke at <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> went to fight against the Turks in Hungary. On the fresh outbreak of civil war in 1567 he returned to France and served under his uncle Aumale. In the autumn of 1568 he received a considerable command, and speedily came into rivalry with Henry of Valois, duke of Anjou. He had not inherited his father's generalship, and his rashness and headstrong valour more than once brought disaster on his troops, but the showy quality of his fighting brought him great popularity in the army....", "...hundreds of them.

But as the population between the ages of six and fourteen had increased to 827,000, only 65 per cent. of the children were attending school, and only one child in three was able to read and write.

The inscription of one dug up in the Via Labicana gives 1,800 feet by 500 feet; another was only twenty-four feet by fifteen feet, and another sixteen feet square. In the case of one of the larger tombs belonging to a family that became Christian, it was easy for them to make a catacomb under it and allow their fellow-Christians to be buried there, or to sell portions of the large space for separate vaults. Many vaults of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet square might be made in the space of 1,800 feet long by 500 feet wide, as the one on the Via Labicana. If the adjoining field belonged to the same family, the catacomb might be extended as far as the family property itself extended. This is the most probable explanation of the _praedium_ of the Lady Lucina and other Christian martyrs. They were heiresses to whom such a tomb and meadow belonged.

Though for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> centuries the name of Christian has been used throughout the whole world, this descriptive word was not much used in the first four centuries. The Christians used to call each other disciples, believers, elect, saints, and brethren. Third parties called them at first Jesseans, spiritual physicians, or gnostics. When heretics or followers of peculiar opinions of a novel kind arose, these were called by the name of their leaders, as Marcionites, Valentinians, Donatists; while...", "...States is handled. But our population in 1796 was only sixteen millions. I estimate the population of the northern section of the United States, as the States will be after the war, at twenty-two millions. In the article alluded to these northern Americans are now stated to be twenty millions. If then we, in 1796, could pay fourteen millions a year with a population of sixteen millions, the United States, with a population of twenty or twenty-two millions, will be able to pay the <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> or seventeen millions sterling of interest which will become due from them,--if their circumstances of payment are as good as were ours. They can do that and more than that if they have the same means per man as we had. And as the means per man resolves itself at last into the labour per man, it may be said that they can pay what we could pay, if they can and will work as hard as we could and did work.

But the experienced eye of Lord Fairfax, and of other members of the Fairfax family, had discovered beneath the unattractive appearance of George Washington a sterling character.

At seventeen he was appointed by Lord Fairfax surveyor of his vast estates in Virginia, and for a time he resided with his lordship at Greenway Court.

Two hundred and eighty of the latter--60 men and 220 women--were subsequently returned. They were brought over from Koma six months later by a Koma envoy, Chong Cha-ryang, to whom the Court presented three hundred pieces of gold.

Two such accounts of the treaty, brief but valuable, are given below. Louis had been the real sovereign of Bavaria for <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years and to his kingdom were now added all the German districts on the right bank of the Rhine (except Friesland), together with Mainz, Worms, and Speyer on the left bank, under the general name of _Francia Orientalis_.

They tried to cut down the anjan [50] trees, but their hands were blistered and they could not go on. Lingo had been asleep. He woke up and saw they had only cut down one or two trees. He took the axe and cut down many trees, and fenced a field and made a gate to it. Black soil appeared. It began to rain, and rained without ceasing for three days. All the rivers and streams were filled. The field became green with rice, and it grew up. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> score of nilgai or blue-bull. They had two leaders, an old bull and his nephew. The young bull saw the rice of Lingo's field and wished to eat it. The uncle told him not to eat of the field of Lingo or all the nilgai would be killed. But the young bull did not heed, and took off all the nilgai to eat the rice. When they got to the field they could find no entrance, so they jumped the fence, which was five cubits high. They ate all the rice from off the field and ran away.

From each of the eight angles of the roof springs a delicate spire or pinnacle, an exact duplicate of the great minarets in the corners, each <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet high, and they are so slender that they look like alabaster pencils glistening in the sunshine. The same duplication is carried out through the entire building. The harmony is complete.

Everyone guesses that 'one of the company' was Boswell.

Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> nine-months regiments formed in August, 1862, the One Hundred and Thirtieth and ours were the only regiments to actively participate in the three great battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, and we lost more men than either of the others.

Two vessels were due from the South Sea Islands in about a month, and as the skippers were both well known to and were on friendly terms with him, he felt pretty certain of getting a berth as second mate or supercargo on one of them. Then he went to look for a quiet lodging. This was soon found, and then realising the fact that sixteen shillings...", "...of Rome which is called the Leonine city.

Thus 1 + 18 + 23 + 26 + 31 + 48 + 56 + 57 = 260, and the sum of their squares is 11,180. Therefore 64 + 47 + 42 + 39 + 34 + 17 + 9 + 8 (obtained by subtracting each of the above numbers from 65) will sum to 260 and their squares to 11,180.

It prohibited it as regards all new cases for all other persons with the same exceptions.[185] Between this date and 1844 we find the same series of exceptions allowed to this general prohibition as in the case of outdoor relief to the able-bodied and their families; and these exceptions became stereotyped in Art. 3 of the Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order of 1844 (still in force).

The rise of the Labour Party began at this election; the serious illness of Mr. Chamberlain followed and hampered Conservative work and progress; the retirement of the Premier took place early in 1908 and, on April of that year, the King called on Mr. Asquith to form the Ministry which carried its election in 1910 by so small a Liberal majority.

What he wanted was a simple white chrysanthemum with <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> petals.

Another experiment, to show that the pressure of the air was the cause of suction, Boyle succeeded in carrying out at a later date. Two discs of marble were carefully polished, so that when a little spirit of turpentine was placed between them the lower disc, with a pound weight suspended from it, was supported by the upper one.

She saw the stars, and the earth with its heavy shadows, and the wavering outlines of the trees and shrubs, and felt a kinship with them. She was very happy, but she did not think. She did not want to think. When any obtrusive thought presented itself she instantly strove to banish it, and at first she succeeded. She wanted to recall the pleasurable sensations of the day, and to prolong them. The last <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hours seemed longer in the retrospect than any other measure of time with which she had been acquainted. She felt as if the terrible dream from which she had awakened that morning in affright had happened in some other state of being which ended abruptly while she was pacing the shady walks of the old palace garden with Mosley Menteith in the afternoon, and was now only to be vaguely recalled. Some great change in herself had taken place since then; she would not define it; she...", "...his days of rest in his father's house, he had not thought. Abandoned of men, he found consolation and blessedness in Him, and now first learned to perceive and enjoy the treasures which the Christian has in heaven. Whilst he roamed about with his flocks, through ice and snow, communion with his God in prayer, and quiet contemplation, were his portion. Let us hear how he himself, in a confession which he subsequently wrote, describes this change which took place in him. \"I was about <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years old, and knew nothing of the true God, when I was led into captivity with many thousands of my countrymen, as we deserved, in that we had departed from God, and had not kept his commandments. There God opened my unbelieving heart, so that I, although late, remembered my sins, and turned with my whole heart to the Lord my God, to Him who had regarded my loneliness, had had compassion on my youth and my ignorance, and had watched over me before I knew him; who, ere I knew...", "...to the bottom, for the purpose of fleeting and tentative examination, he gave the pan a sudden sloshing movement, emptying it of water. And the whole bottom showed as if covered with butter. Thus the yellow gold flashed up as the muddy water was flirted away. It was gold--gold-dust, coarse gold, nuggets, large nuggets. He was all alone. He set the pan down for a moment and thought long thoughts. Then he finished the washing, and weighed the result in his scales. At the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> dollars to the ounce, the pan had contained seven hundred and odd dollars. It was beyond anything that even he had dreamed. His fondest anticipation's had gone no farther than twenty or thirty thousand dollars to a claim; but here were claims worth half a million each at the least, even if they were spotted.

The Constabulary behaved with great gallantry but were hopelessly outnumbered, and lost their seven-pounder gun, four killed, six wounded, and twenty-four prisoners.

Thus in the heart of a native state the two great white races of South Africa were to be seen locked in a desperate conflict. However unavoidable, the sight was certainly one to be deplored.

Large voices, that is, voices that proceed from large resonance cavities, are often badly strained at this period of life by too loud and too high singing. It must not for a moment be forgotten that the age is a critical one for vocal effort, and a strain that the adult woman's voice will endure with apparent impunity may produce lasting evil effects on the voice of a girl of from fourteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years of age. If the requirements of the music are such that pitches above F, the fifth line G clef, must be occasionally sung, let the voices upon the part sing lightly.

Soon followed the news of Beresina--a poor little river of Lithuania--where the history of the world hung for a day as on a thread. But a flash of the dying genius surmounted superhuman difficulties, and the catastrophe was turned into a disaster. The divisions of Victor and Oudinot--the last to preserve any semblance of military discipline--were almost annihilated. The French lost twelve thousand killed or drowned in the river, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> thousand prisoners, twelve of the remaining guns. But they were across the Beresina. There was no longer a Grand Army, however. There was no army at all--only a starving, struggling trail of men stumbling through the snow, without organization or discipline or hope.

From that day the deaths diminished, and the sick began to recover. Of the thirty-two commissioned officers, only one, I think, was ever sick at all, and his sickness was of a kind altogether different; and, it is impossible to resist the conclusion, that the non-commissioned officers and soldiers got their disease from want of sufficient room, and, consequently, of sufficient pure air to...", "...trouble, as there were not spoils enough to go around, and his army was conquered.

The fight, however, fulfilled the object for which the advance was undertaken, that of occupying the Boers' attention and enabling the column from Dundee to make its way into Ladysmith unmolested. The Boers were now closing in on the latter town from all directions, and preparations for defence at once began. The town-hall and the schools were fitted up as hospitals and everything arranged for the reception of wounded. As the Boers had already been seen near Colenso, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> miles to the south, it was certain that the communications would ere long be cut. No more unsuitable place for a military camp could well have been selected than Ladysmith, which had indeed been chosen, years before the war was thought of, on account of its position on the railway, and the vicinity of the Klip river. The fact that the country immediately round was fertile and forage was obtainable no doubt influenced the military authorities in their selection.

But the liberties of a rebellious people, unmolested for <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years, were not to be suddenly abolished. The more he brushed the more the indignant locks rose up in revolt. He broke the comb and threw it down angrily. \"Wet your hair,\" said the Tennessee Shad. \"Soak it in water,\" said the Gutter Pup. \"Soak it in witch-hazel,\" said Dennis. \"It will make it more fragrant.\" Dink hesitated: \"Won't it smell too much?\" \"Naw.

We take him at first on trial for a Sabbath or two, to try his paces, and if he takes with the folks, if he goes down well, we clinch the bargain, and let and sell the pews; and, I tell you it pays well and makes a real good investment.

I also hope that social recognition of an appropriate kind will be given to healthy, capable, and large families, and that social influence will be exerted towards the encouragement of eugenic marriages.\" This volume, a model for all future autobiographers, ends with the following splendid statement of the eugenic creed:-- \"A true philanthropist concerns himself not only with society as a whole, but also with as many of the individuals who compose it...", "...at Roxbury, the left at Medford and Chelsea. Towards the end of May, a considerable reinforcement arrived at Boston from England, which, with the garrison, formed an army of from ten to twelve thousand men--all veteran troops. At the head of this reinforcement were three distinguished and practical generals--Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne. The difference in numbers was on the side of the Americans--not so, however, their military science, arms, or ammunition. They had, in all, but <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> field-pieces, six of which, at the very utmost, were in a condition for service. Their brass pieces, which were few, were of the smallest caliber. They had, however, some heavy iron cannon, with three or four mortars and howitzers, and some scanty provision of balls and bombs. But of powder, they were almost totally destitute. The situation of the English was now daily becoming more perplexing and critical, and the necessity was increasingly apparent, if they intended to...", "...D flat to E major looks violently enharmonic on paper, as in the first movement of Beethoven's _Sonata, Op. 110_. But E major with four sharps is merely the most convenient way of expressing F flat, a key which would need six flats and a double flat. The reality of an enharmonic modulation can be easily tested by transporting the passage a semitone. Thus, the passage just cited, put a semitone lower, becomes a perfectly diatonic modulation from C to E flat. But no transposition of the <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> bars before the return of the main theme in the scherzo of Beethoven's _Sonata in E[flat], Op. 31_, No. 3, will get rid of the fact that the diminished 7th (G B[flat] D[flat] E[natural]), on the dominant of F minor, must have changed into G B[flat] D[flat] F[flat] (although Beethoven does not take the trouble to alter the spelling) before it could resolve, as it does, upon the dominant of A[flat].

The two principal structures, called palaces, are surrounded by walls one hundred and forty feet high, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet thick at the base, but tapering to three or four feet at the top. Round one of the palaces the wall is double, as shown by the section in the cut. The English translation of Rivero, instead of surrounding one of the palaces with a double wall like the original, represents one wall as being twice as high and thick as the other. These walls, like all the structures of Gran-Chimu, are of adobes nine by eighteen inches, resting on a foundation of rough stones laid in clay.

Sargent describes fifteen species of hickory and in addition a large number of varieties by environment and by hybridization. There is a Mexican hickory, making <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> species for the North American continent, and the late Mr. F. N.

No one had seen such a very real doll's tea set before. From that...", "...on the edge of a dense forest. He had walked so far that the notes of the bagpipe hardly reached his ears, and was about to return to his companions, when, on turning his head, he espied, within a few paces, a young girl seated on the bank, looking toward the valley with a bewitchingly sweet expression, and smiling at the dance, which she could see in the distance; but there was in her smile a tinge of melancholy which seemed to be a natural part of it. She was apparently fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years of age. Her garments indicated poverty, but her charms made one overlook them. Beautiful fair hair played in curls about her innocent brow, her features were refined and delicate, her mouth graceful and smiling, and her soft blue eyes wore a pathetic expression of gentle melancholy which harmonized with the pallor of her complexion. Frederic stopped and gazed at the young woman; he could not tire of contemplating her. Why was she there, alone by the brook, while her...", "...Music was taken up to aid in getting proper intonation and rhythm in oratory and for learning the religious chants.

In a series of resolutions which were not a part of the platform but were nevertheless \"expressive of the sentiment of this convention,\" the party declared itself in sympathy \"with the efforts of organized workingmen to shorten the hours of labor\"; it condemned \"the fallacy of protecting American labor under the present system, which opens our ports to the pauper and criminal classes of the world and crowds out our wage-earners\"; and it...", "...there were many who urged Isabella to declare herself at once as the Queen of Castile and to head a revolution against her brother, the unworthy Henry. Her natural inclinations, as well as the whole character of her early education, had made her devout, almost bigoted, by nature, and it was but natural that her advisers at this time in her career were mostly members of the clergy, who saw in this young queen-to-be a great support for the Spanish Church in the future. But this girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> was wiser than her advisers, for she refused to head a revolution, and contented herself with a claim to the throne upon her brother's death. Such a claim necessarily had to run counter to the claim of the dubious Princess Juana, and to discredit her cause as much as possible her sobriquet _La Beltraneja_ was zealously revived. Sure of the support of the clergy, and still wishing to be near to her advisers, Isabella went to the monastery at Avila, where, it is said, deputations...", "...might not suspect me, and then I nipped over a stile, and ran away across country, going inland, away from the sea, as fast as I could travel. I could tell my direction by the sun, and I kept a westerly course, almost due west, for three or four hours, till I was tired out. It was a lonely walk, too; hardly anything but wild, rather marshy country, with few houses, few churches, and no bigger town than the tiniest of villages. At about six o'clock that afternoon, when I had gone some <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> miles since daybreak, I felt that I could go no further, and began to cast about for a lodging-place.

The boy had set his heart on college, and it almost looks as though a boy can accomplish anything with such a motto as poor William's. He borrowed some Latin and Greek books, and set hard to work. Soon his dear parents died, and so the care of a brother and sister fell upon him.

He describes a reception of much pomp and ceremony, given to the Duchess and the Princess by the Mayor and other officers of the town of Burghley, followed by a great dinner, which \"went off well,\" except that an awkward waiter, in a spasm of loyal excitement, emptied the contents of a pail of ice in the lap of the Duchess, which, though she took it coolly, \"made a great bustle.\" I am afraid the...", "...meditation.

As long as I could see a corn-field or a tree I was not satisfied. Nor indeed was I satisfied at last.

Some fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years afterwards, it happened that the king and queen went to visit one of their summer palaces; when the young princess, running one morning all over the rooms, in the frolicsome spirits of youth, at length climbed up one of the turrets, and reached a little garret, where she found an old woman busy spinning with a distaff. The poor soul had never even heard of the king's edict, and did not dream that she was committing high treason by using a spindle. \"What are you doing,...", "...1.] Your first question is, 'I ask your own heart, whether popularity and applause of variety of professors, be not in the bottom of what you have said; that hath been your snare to pervert the right ways of the Lord, and to lead others into a path wherein we can find none of the footsteps of the flock in the first ages?'

In the mean time the National Convention of France were boasting of their victories; it was asserted that they had gained twenty-seven pitched battles, taken one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> strong places, ninety-one thousand prisoners, and three thousand eight hundred pieces of cannon.

It must also be borne in mind that the mint cost of coining silver is many times greater than that of the same amount in gold. More than <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> tons of silver are required as the equivalent of one ton of gold. As a cold matter of fact, silver is neither the best nor the cheapest standard.

It is considered to be the oldest and smallest chapel in Scotland, its dimensions being sixteen feet six inches by ten feet <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> inches. The semicircular chancel is separated from the nave by a well-carved double-round arch, decorated with Norman zigzag mouldings.

Beza began by replying to the first part of the cardinal's speech, and showed that there is an invisible as well as a visible...", "...waters of the lowland brook, spanned by a little stone bridge, the fish hung motionless above the yellow gravel, and the dragonfly sat quite still, perched upon the sharp tip of a spike of the rushes, with its wings glistening in the sun. Along the road a youth came riding upon a fair milk-white barb, and the folk that he passed stopped and turned and looked after him, for never had so lovely a lad or one so gaily clad been seen in Nottingham before. He could not have been more than <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years of age, and was as fair as any maiden. His long yellow hair flowed behind him as he rode along, all clad in silk and velvet, with jewels flashing and dagger jingling against the pommel of the saddle. Thus came the Queen's Page, young Richard Partington, from famous London Town down into Nottinghamshire, upon Her Majesty's bidding, to seek Robin Hood in Sherwood Forest. The road was hot and dusty and his journey had been long, for that day he had come all the way from...", "...were very mischievous, still such was his respectability, that his enemies never entirely prevailed against him. His eyes were frequently in danger, but his adroitness preserved them; and he had at last the good fortune to die peaceably in his bed in the present Shah's reign.

In my youth I was remarkable for the attention which I paid to my studies, and before I had arrived at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> I was celebrated for writing a fine hand. I knew Hafiz entirely by heart, and had myself acquired such a facility in making verses, that I might almost have been said to speak in numbers. There was no subject that I did not attempt. I wrote on the loves of Leilah and Majnoun;[19] I never heard the note of a nightingale, but I made it pour out its loves to the rose; and wherever I went I never failed to produce my poetry and chant it out in the assembly. At this time the king...", "...henna, and its blue eyes, is not that of a warrior, but of a serious scholar or diplomatist. And he needed all the force of courage and all the arts of diplomacy for the work he had to do. Layard's early training was in the line of preparation for his life's work. Much of his boyhood was spent in Italy, where he acquired a taste for the fine arts, and as much knowledge of them as a child could obtain who was constantly in the society of artists and connoisseurs. At about the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> he was sent to England to study the law, for which he was destined by his parents. After six years in the office of a solicitor, and in the chambers of an eminent conveyancer,--for that is the way that lawyers were educated then,--he determined to leave England and seek a career elsewhere. He had a relative in Ceylon, who gave him hopes of securing a position there, and for Ceylon he started. A friend of his, ten years older, was bound for the same destination, both fond of...", "...visit to Rome that I often saw Victor Emmanuel, Italy's first King. Every Sunday afternoon he drove on the Pincian Hill. The extreme Catholics of Rome, the Pope's party, paid him little or no attention, and scarcely greeted him when he passed; but all the rest of Rome and all Italy nearly worshiped the \"Re Galantuomo.\" He was a stout, dark looking man, with black eyes and a mustache like a horse's mane. He was fifty-six years old then, and had been twelve years King of Sardinia, and <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years King of Italy. At this time our Minister, Mr. Marsh, arranged to have a friend and myself presented to Pope Pius IX, but a sudden attack of Roman fever deprived me of the pleasure. Two men have existed in my life-time whom I should have given much to know,--Mr. Gladstone and Abraham Lincoln.

And Felicity, who was useful, would, in her secret soul, have given anything to be interesting. Which is the way of human nature. Company descended on us that afternoon. First came Aunt Janet's sister, Mrs. Patterson, with a daughter of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years and a son of two. They were followed by a buggy-load of Markdale people; and finally, Mrs. Elder Frewen and her sister from Vancouver, with two small daughters of the latter, arrived. \"It never rains but it pours,\" said Uncle Roger, as he went out to take their horse. But Felicity's foot was on her native heath. She had been baking all the afternoon, and, with a pantry well stocked with biscuits, cookies, cakes, and pies, she cared not if all Carlisle came to tea....", "...state of things in Paris in this connexion is, in her own words, 'most abominable, too horrible for words.' Children are procured from certain theatre dancing schools, and their birth certificates sometimes falsified to make it appear that they are over fourteen, although often they may be as young as twelve or even ten. Then they are conveyed to vile places in Paris where their doom is sure. Let us hope that in due course this Bill will become law, for if girls are protected up to <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> in this country, surely they should not be sent out of it in doubtful circumstances under that age. Needless to say abominations of this nature are not unknown in London. Thus a while ago the Army received a telegram from a German girl asking, 'Can you help?' Two of its people went at once to the address given, and, contriving to get into the house, discovered there a young woman who, imagining that she had been engaged in Germany as a servant in an English family, found...", "...wanting a spire.

The nave was crowded, the canons occupied the stalls in their purple tippets edged with crimson; purple, because the chapter of a cathedral; crimson edged, because the founder of the See was a martyr. Fifteen, and the Dean, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> in all, were in their places. On the altar steps, in the apse, in the centre, sat Peter Nielsen in his old, worn cassock, without surplice. On the left side of the altar stood the richly-sculptured Episcopal throne, and on the seat was placed the jewelled mitre, over the arm the cloth of gold cope was cast, and against the back leaned the pastoral crook of silver gilt, encrusted with precious stones. When the last note of the bell sounded, the Dean rose from his stall, and...", "...to on Saturday night,\" Ivor answered. Glen went up to the horse and examined him well, passing his hand over him, carefully taking in his points. It was difficult to find fault with Barellan. If there was one it was his hocks, which were large and rather unsightly, but there was nothing wrong with them. They were rather low down, in the greyhound style. He had a splendid back and quarters, good shoulders, neck and chest, a shapely head and a good forehead, and fine eyes. He stood over <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hands. \"What do you think of him?\" Ivor asked. \"He's a good-looking horse. He ought to gallop. He's built for it,\" replied Glen. \"So he can. He's the best I have by a long way, although some people prefer Flash.\" \"I don't,\" said Glen promptly. \"He's in the Melbourne Cup, isn't he?\" \"Yes, in both Cups,\" said the trainer. \"Will he go for them both?\" \"I don't know. It depends on the sweep-money, I expect. Bellshaw's always insisted on having a cut out of the sweep...", "...\"Sire, it is Belle-Ile-en-Mer,\" replied Fouquet with simplicity. At this word, at this name, Colbert made so marked a movement, that the king turned round to enforce the necessity for reserve. Fouquet did not appear to be the least in the world concerned by the movement of Colbert, or the king's signal. \"Monsieur,\" continued Louis, \"you have then fortified Belle-Isle?\" \"Yes, sire; and I have brought the plan and the accounts to your majesty,\" replied Fouquet; \"I have expended <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hundred livres in this operation.\" \"What to do?\" replied Louis, coldly, having taken the initiative from a malicious look of the intendant. \"For an aim very easy to seize,\" replied Fouquet. \"Your majesty was on cool terms with Great Britain.\" \"Yes; but since the restoration of King Charles II. I have formed an alliance with him.\" \"A month since, sire, your majesty has truly said; but it is more than six months since the fortifications of Belle-Isle were begun.\"...", "...when the savages had you in their clutches, as these lads here have told?\" \"Here is the story of a man who came on the frontier believing himself a murderer, and doing whatsoever he might to atone for a supposed crime committed at a moment when anger held possession of him. As you know, I was born in Fauquier County in 1755, where my father, an Irishman, had won for himself by hard labor such a home and such a plantation as a poor man could survey with pride. Up to the time I was <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years old there came no thought into my mind save to be a planter, and continue the work my father had begun. Then I loved a girl, the daughter of our nearest neighbor, and counted, with the consent of her parents as well as mine, on marrying her in due course of time. Martin Donnelly came into the district, and by unfair means, as I did and still claim, won her from me. I met him the day after he was married. He taunted me with what he had done; claimed that an Irish planter...", "...scientific and humane, with simplicity; but, as Mr Symons says, \"a spirit of too much fire in too frail a body,\" and one moreover who has suffered and fought to the limit of human endurance.

We hear, too, of a love-story that would make an idyll; of passion so strong and a will so resolute as almost to be incredible in such a delicate creature; of a marriage in defiance of caste, a few years of brilliant happiness and then a tragedy.

Walker and <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> of his officers were to go on board the _St. Mary's_, thence to Panama, and home. It is a striking, and in its way, an heroic picture, that of the filibuster chief parting from his wild, wayward, but devoted comrades.

The only solution of this problem is for every school to have at least one teacher-training class each year. Any school which sets itself definitely to the task of training its own teachers, from its own ranks, for its own classes, will reduce the teacher problem to a minimum. Such a class should be composed of young men and women between the ages of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> and thirty, specially chosen by the pastor and superintendent because of their interest in the work and apparent fitness for it. The class should be taught by the best teacher obtainable, though he need not be an expert. It should meet at the church, at the regular Sunday-school hour, thus solving the difficulty as to time and place. Substitute teachers should never be drawn from this class. A teacher's diploma should be issued to each student completing the course and passing...", "...on the Great Peace that, though perhaps after many days, must follow the Great War and the little peace. Answering along this line, the protagonists of salvation through education pretty well agree that the thing itself means the widest possible extension of our public school system, with free state universities and technical schools, and the extension of the educational period, with laws so rigid, and enforcement so pervasive and impartial, that no child between the ages of six and <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> can possibly escape. This free, compulsory and universal education is assumed to be scrupulously secular and hedged about with every safeguard against the insidious encroachments of religion; it will aim to give a little training in most of the sciences, and much in the practical necessities of business life, as for example, stenography, book-keeping, advertising and business science; it will cover a broad field of manual training leading to \"graduate courses\" in special...", "...visit my wife's family, where Yvan, surgeon of the Emperor, came to see me every day.

These two were my only absences for <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years; therefore, on my return from Moscow, and during the campaign of France, my disease having reached its height, I quitted the Emperor at Fontainebleau, because it was impossible for me, in spite of all my attachment to so kind a master, and all the gratitude which I felt towards him, to perform my duties longer.

At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> he was sent to London and placed under Henry Cline (1750-1827), surgeon to St Thomas's hospital.

He sailed with his father to attack the French in 1346, and though only <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> was knighted by the king immediately on reaching France.

On another occasion, he tells him that he has just come to West Wycombe to spend a few days and breathe a little fresh air. \"I am in this House,\" he said, \"as much at my Ease as if it was my own; and the Gardens are a Paradise.\" After a journey to Oxford, with Lord Le Despencer, he informed the same correspondent that the former was very good to him on all occasions and seemed of late very desirous of his company.

The Ogulnian law in the same year increased the number to nine, five plebeian being added to the four patrician members. In the time of Sulla the number was fifteen, which was increased to <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> by Julius Caesar.

The American fox most widely found is that which Mr. Hornaday calls \"our wise old friend, the red fox,\" which is so well known in many parts of the country. It is a very cunning creature, \"so well able to take care of itself that it refuses to be exterminated.\" Still we are told that it was not hard for the early settlers in this country to outwit the red foxes, and to shoot them and trap them when they came...", "...that it could no longer be winked at, and it drew forth a remonstrance from the British cabinet.

Early's force of from fifteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> thousand men was, of course, in no way strong enough to be an army of invasion. The best success for which he could hope would be, in breaking through the defences of Washington, to hold the capital for a day or even a few hours.

Later, after the Supervisors had confessed, these affidavits were to be used by the defense at practically all the graft trials in efforts to break down their testimony against the bribe-givers. During the examination, Ach endeavored to force from Langdon and his deputies a statement of what evidence they had against Ruef. In this Ach failed.

She was the only daughter of an Italian by an English mother. The father had known better days; in his prosperity he had travelled, and won in England the affections of a lady of some fortune. He had been induced to speculate; he lost his all; he settled at Naples, and taught languages and music. His wife died when Isabel, christened from her mother, was ten years old. At <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> she came out on the stage; two years afterwards her father departed this life, and Isabel was an orphan. Glyndon, a man of pleasure and a regular attendant at the theatre, had remarked the young actress behind the scenes; he fell in love with her, and he told her so.

We paddled out and got aboard --clumb in at an upstairs window.

It is decided that the first night of our pilgrimage, we shall request hospitality at the hacienda of the ex-Minister Hechavarria--_La Gabia_, which is about ten leagues of very bad road from Toluca--which is <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> from Mexico. All these important arrangements being made, and a sketch of our journey traced out, we are about retiring to rest, in the agreeable prospect of not entering any four or two wheeled vehicle, be it a cart, carriage, coach, or diligence, till we return here.

Mules to be loaded, horses to be fitted with saddles; and one mule lame, and another to be procured, and the trunks found...", "...so nearly entrapped. This summons of ridiculous solemnity to keep a treaty which had already been torn to shreds by both parties, Oberstein answered with defiance and contempt. The reply was an immediate cannonade from the batteries of the citadel; which made the position of those erecting the ramparts excessively dangerous. The wall was strengthened with bales of merchandise, casks of earth, upturned wagons, and similar bulky objects, hastily piled together. In, some places it was <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet high; in others less than six. Night fell before the fortification was nearly completed. Unfortunately it was bright moonlight. The cannon from the fortress continued to play upon the half-finished works. The Walloons, and at last the citizens, feared to lift their heads above their frail rampart. The senators, whom Champagny had deputed to superintend the progress of the enterprise, finding the men so indisposed, deserted their posts. They promised themselves that,...", "...I rose in astonishment, and begged my Lady Ashley's pardon, for of a surety I had not known her. So I took her by the hand and kissed her; and was about to sit down again, when, with a smile that I could scarce fail to know, the other stranger saith-- \"And hath Isoult Barry forgot Anne Basset?\" \"My darling Nan!\" cried I, \"that I should not have known _thee_.\" \"Nay,\" saith she, again with her own sweet smile, \"'tis no marvel, dear heart, seeing thou hast not seen me for <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years.\" For I had missed seeing her in the procession at Queen Mary's coronation. Then after we had embraced, Philippa said-- \"I scantly know, Isoult, if thou wilt be glad to see us, considering the ill news we bring.\" \"Why, Philippa, what ill news?\" asked I. \"I heard of thy brother's death,--Mr James,--and writ to thee thereupon,\"--for methought Philippa had not received my letter. \"Ay, I had thy letter, and I thank thee for it,\" answered she. \"But hast heard...", "...death on the ground that in teaching the method of attacking a fortress he used drawings of Yedo Castle.

His eldest son, Prince Hidehito, being a mere baby, it was decided that Princess Tomo, Momozono's elder sister, should occupy the throne, Prince Hidehito becoming the Crown Prince. Her Majesty is known in history as Go-Sakuramachi. Her reign lasted only eight years, and in 1770 she abdicated in favour of her nephew, Hidehito, who ascended the throne as the Emperor Go-Momozono and died after a reign of nine years. This exhausted the lineal descendants of the Emperor...", "...and concealed the place of burial with leaves; if in an enemy's country, they removed the remains, even if in a state of partial decay, on the first opportunity that offered. To prevent the dead body of a brave from falling into the hands of an enemy appeared with them a religious duty paramount even to sepulture. As an evidence of this, Sam Brady, the celebrated Indian-fighter, once waylaid and shot an old Indian on the Susquehanna who was accompanied by his two sons, aged respectively <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> and eighteen years. The young Indians ran when their father fell, and Brady left the body and returned home. Next morning, having occasion to pass the place, he found the body gone, and by the tracks he ascertained that it had been removed by the lads. He followed them forty miles before he overtook them, bearing their heavy burden with the will of sturdy work-horses. Brady had set out with the determination of killing both, but the sight so affected him that he left them to...", "...Wallenstein made a movement, as if he designed to penetrate through Lusatia into Saxony, and circulated the report that Piccolomini had already invaded that country. Arnheim immediately broke up his camp in Silesia, to follow him, and hastened to the assistance of the Electorate. By this means the Swedes were left exposed, who were encamped in small force under Count Thurn, at Steinau, on the Oder, and this was exactly what Wallenstein desired. He allowed the Saxon general to advance <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> miles towards Meissen, and then suddenly turning towards the Oder, surprised the Swedish army in the most complete security. Their cavalry were first beaten by General Schafgotsch, who was sent against them, and the infantry completely surrounded at Steinau by the duke's army which followed. Wallenstein gave Count Thurn half an hour to deliberate whether he would defend himself with 2,500 men, against more than 20,000, or surrender at discretion. But there was no room for...", "...and brought him down with a treacherous volley, then cut off his head and sent it in to the Prince. Our guns were not heavy enough to cope with those of the fortress, and so we passed the time shelling the redoubts thrown up on the little hillocks around the town, alternating these operations with an occasional assault of one of the nearest of them when the men got impatient for some active movement. Meanwhile we learned that the Russian government was sending us four heavier guns, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> and thirty-two bronze rifled breech-loaders, the heaviest we had being ten-pound muzzle-loaders against a battery of field guns, Krupp steel, breech-loading twelve-pounders.

Coleridge, who knew him well at Malta, always spoke of him in the highest terms. Our history does not afford a more impressive example of a useful life uselessly thrown away. Of his duel with Barron the following is probably a correct account of the closing scene: The combatants approached within <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet of each other, because one was near-sighted, and the rule was that both should take deliberate aim before the word was given. They both fired, and fell with their heads not ten feet apart. Each believed himself mortally hurt. Before their removal from the ground they were reconciled, and blessed each other, declaring there was nothing between them. All that was necessary to have prevented the meeting was a personal explanation. Sir T.

I remember especially the placing of a battle monument just outside our village and the horde of strangers who came from various parts of the state for the ceremony. The heroes were five men in gray uniforms, all who were left of the company which had stood there and had been shot to pieces. One was an old man, three were middle aged, and one was so young that he could not have been more than <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> on the day of the fight. The man who had been their captain stayed at the parsonage. After supper the principal men of the village gathered in our parlor. I stood by the Father's chair and listened wide-eyed as, in his cracked voice, the Captain told us all the details of that slaughter. I remember that in the excitement of his story-telling the old soldier became profane, and the Father did not rebuke him.

Fortune, so adverse to me heretofore, seemed to have been more kind to me at this time, for the very night succeeding the day on which I killed the pig, a storm of hail, snow, and sleet, came on, and continued fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hours. The snow lay on the ground four inches in depth, and the whole country was covered with a crust almost hard enough to bear a man. In this state of the weather I could not travel, and my stock of pork was invaluable to me.

Still, there are chronic cases with a single chill, and acute cases with many. It rarely occurs that a patient has more than one chill in twenty-four hours. Billroth noticed among his patients only <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> who had two chills, and only six who each had three chills, in one day. The experience that fewer chills occur during the evening and night than in the morning and afternoon has been confirmed by statistics. Among 287 chills, 220 occurred from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M., while during the night, from 8 P.M. to 8 A.M., only 67 were observed. By this arbitrary division of the twenty-four hours Billroth desired to take into consideration the daily exacerbation in connection with the usual...", "...cherries.\" She pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression quite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open eyes. \"See here,\" she said. \"Don't let us talk about dying; I don't like it.

To talk about Dickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> shillings a week--and the children who got fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies. And about Dickon's mother--and the skipping-rope--and the moor with the sun on it--and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod.

He told Mr. Meyer straight out that his daughter was paid <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> florins, but she did not earn it, for she was very backward in learning--in fact, she made no progress at all; nor did she seem to care very much, for she never appeared at any of the rehearsals, and her salary went for the most part in paying fines.

The southern pair are over a century later in date. Both the turrets on the north side are octagonal, but neither of them is crocketed. The view from this spot at sunset is particularly fine. After passing the deanery, and turning to the left, it will be noticed that...", "...inspired by genius,--a poet, or an author, or an artist, perhaps a lawyer merely, but of rare talents, at any rate a man of superior intellect,--in a word, a paragon, who, when he should appear upon the earth, incarnate, she expected would conceive a violent passion for her, in which case, she should take it into consideration whether to marry him or not.

This, upon removal, was found to cover some fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> small earth mounds. In one of these were found human bones and river shells. In another was encountered a layer of hard white fire-clay. Two or three feet below this was a wooden trough. This was overlaid by small logs of wood to serve as a cover, and in it was found a skeleton, around which appeared the impression of a coarse cloth.

CHAPTER II. The two years had not been all playtime any more than they had been all summer. When one has not father, or mother, or brother, and all one's friends have barely bread enough for themselves, life cannot be very easy, nor its crusts very many at any time. Bebee had a cherub's mouth, and a dreamer's eyes, and a poet's thoughts sometimes in her own untaught and unconscious fashion. But all the same she was a little hard-working Brabant...", "...Therefore, that we may henceforth concentrate all our forces for the practical application of our one grand, distinctive, national idea--universal suffrage--I hope we will unanimously adopt the resolution before us, thus resolving ourselves into the American Equal Eights Association. Notwithstanding the rebuff they had received from the Anti-Slavery Society, this resolution was unanimously adopted and the Woman's Rights Society which had existed practically for <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years was merged into the American Equal Rights Association to work for universal suffrage. A constitution was adopted and officers chosen.[37] Mrs. Stanton thus describes the last moments of the convention: \"As Lucretia Mott uttered her few parting words of benediction, the fading sunlight through the stained windows falling upon her pure face, a celestial glory seemed about her, a sweet and peaceful influence pervaded every heart, and all responded to Theodore Tilton when he...", "...distinguished by the elegance of his manners and the beauty of his countenance and figure--advantages which, coupled with the known loyal principles of his father, and the sufferings he had undergone in the royal cause, procured for him, at the early age of fifteen, the situation of page in the household of the Duke of York, afterwards James II. His inclination for arms was then so decided, that that prince procured for him a commission in one of the regiments of guards when he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years old. His uncommonly handsome figure then attracted no small share of notice from the beauties of the court of Charles II., and even awakened a passion in one of the royal mistresses herself. Impatient to signalize himself, however, he left their seductions, and embarked as a volunteer in the expedition against Tangiers in 1766. Thus his first essay in arms was made in actions against the Moors.

There is a radical difference between the poem as Milton wrote it and as it appears set to Handel's music. Milton presented two distinct poems, though allied by antithesis, and Penseroso does not speak until Allegro has finished. In the poem as adapted for music they alternate in <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> strophes and antistrophes. The adaptation of these two parts was made by Charles Jennens, who was a frequent collaborator with Handel.[27] He also suggested the addition of a third part, the Moderato, and wrote the words, in which he counsels both Allegro and Penseroso to take the middle course of moderation as the safest. The wisdom of the poet in suggesting the _via media_ is more to be commended than his boldness in supplementing Milton's stately verse with commonplaces,...", "...so that hon. Members of this House might have read it? The letter of the noble Lord (Lord Stanley) was dated the 22nd of June, 1858, and to this hour it has never been answered. The noble Lord's despatch disallowed the annexation; it condemned it, and asked for information.

I say it is not fitting that the Secretary of State for India should be treated with utter disregard, if not with something like contempt, by any great satrap who happens to be sent out to govern any of the provinces of this country. This very case shows, that in the midst of the terrible hurricane of the mutiny, the thirst for annexation was unslaked. At the very moment, or just before, that the Queen issued her gracious Proclamation here, the Government...", "...placed crosswise.

The blastoderm of the chick before incubation is found to be composed of spherical anucleate bodies which Schwann considers to be cells, because they almost certainly develop into the cells of the incubated blastoderm, which are clearly recognisable as such after eight hours' incubation. The serous and mucous layers can be distinguished after <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hours' incubation, and it is found that the cells of the serous layer contain definite nuclei, though such seem to be absent in the cells of the mucous layer. Between the two layers other cells are formed belonging to the vessel layer, which is, however, in Schwann's opinion not a very definitely individualised layer. Schwann's next step is a detailed demonstration of the origin of each tissue from simple cells such as those composing the incubated blastoderm. \"The...", "...land.

He gained 16-1/2 pounds the first week and 31 pounds in five weeks. One would think that the idea about the weak stomach would have died a natural death, but it did not.

Stretching his arms toward me, he cried out, \"Lady, lady, come here!\" He was a boy of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years, one of the glorious Third Alabama, and he begged so hard to be allowed to see \"the boys\" that I had his bunk drawn up to an open window, supporting him in my arms so that he _could_ see.

Its mass might be lifted from the level of the water to its present position by the combustion of four bushels of coal. The enormous consumption of coals produced by the application of the steam engine in the arts and manufactures, as well as to railways and navigation, has of late years excited the fears of many as to the possibility of the exhaustion of our coal-mines. Such apprehensions are, however, altogether groundless. If the present consumption of coal be estimated at <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> millions of tons annually, it is demonstrable that the coal-fields of this country would not be exhausted for many centuries. But in speculations like these, the probable, if not certain progress of improvement and discovery ought not be overlooked; and we may safely pronounce that, long before such a period of time shall have rolled away, other and more powerful mechanical agents will supersede the use of coal.

But the little one is apt to become too old for her years. This happened with Beret, while Mildrid only gained by being forbearing and kind and sympathetic--and she made her parents and grandparents happy. There is no more to tell till Mildrid was in her fifteenth year; then old Knut died, suddenly and easily.

These mandates exasperated the Moriscoes throughout Andalusia. They rebelled and fought desperately; but after frightful bloodshed and suffering, they were quelled and broken down, never to regain their ancient sway. The suppression of the heretics was complete by the time of Philip III. And at this time began the decline of Seville's prosperity. When Philip V. reigned, the <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> thousand looms of the city had been reduced to less than three hundred, and the population was thinned to 'a quarter of its former number of inhabitants.' In the fruitful district around Seville the vineyards and olive gardens were in a state of neglect, and fields once fertile became wastes. Trade declined rapidly with the extirpation of heresy. The industrial population was deprived of its most skilful and industrious members when the last band of Moriscoes quitted the city....", "...Fancy twelve officers in a tent!

Captain Speedy says that <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> is very much nearer the mark; and as he has a knowledge of the country, while the Quartermaster's department have uniformly been wrong in their distances, it is safe to assume that it is a fifteen days' march; that is to say, even without allowing a day for the capture of Magdala, or for arranging matters there, we cannot be back to Lat under a month.

Service may become perfectly normal to life. Our modern paupers, whether they tramp the highways or ride in private cars, came usually out of homes where the moral standard interpreted life as just the chance of graft, to gain without giving, to have without earning. Parental indulgence educates in pauperism. Let a boy remain the passive beneficiary of all the advantages of a home until he is <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> or eighteen, and it will be exceedingly difficult to convert him from the pauper habit. The hard task before parents is to save their children from the snare of passive luxury. Perhaps, remembering our toilsome youth, we seek to shield them. It is a serious unkindness. It is a wrong to our world. The religious mind is the one that takes life in terms of service, sees the days as doors to ways of usefulness, girds itself with the towel, and finds honor in bending to do the...", "...you could say more than that for English honesty; although, of course, there may be exceptions here as well as there. After I left Jelasore the other day, I remembered that I had omitted to lock my patarahs or tin travelling-boxes.

Parties were immediately sent out in search of the natives, who soon brought back many chiefs and priests who were well treated, and both supplied us plentifully with provisions, and pointed out our road to Izguantepec, which was three days journey, or <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> leagues from the town where we now were. During our journey to this place, our stage-dancer and three of the new come Spaniards died of fatigue, and many of the Mexicans had been left behind to perish. We discovered likewise that some of the Mexican chiefs who accompanied us, had seized some of the natives of the places through which we passed, and had eaten them to appease their hunger.

Nothing could apparently be more outside his sympathy than the department needing these seven thousand volumes; but he recognized its importance in the general plan of the new institution, bought the library for over twelve thousand dollars, and gave it to the university.

At a later period, to extinguish the university debt, to increase the equipment, and eventually to provide free scholarships and fellowships, he made an additional gift of about eighty thousand...", "...moving backwards and forwards, but stopping now and again to exchange pleasantries, or more often fatuous remarks about food, with the rest of the picket at the fire. It was nothing new to Jack that the Congo soldier's idea of sentry-go is somewhat loose. Again Jack was favoured by circumstances. The glow of the fire did not extend far into the darkness of the gully; the noise of the laughing and talking was loud enough to drown all slight sounds for some distance around. Thus the <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> men in the gully could approach very near the camp fire without being seen or heard. Jack's plan, already half formed before he started, was quickly adapted to the conditions. Silently gathering his men together, he ordered them in a whisper to follow him in a charge with the bayonet; not to fire except at the word of command; not in their pursuit of the enemy to go beyond the camp fire. It would have been easy to dispose of at least a third of the picket by firing upon them...", "...The master and slave then proceeded. David cut a path with a bill-hook, and behind him came a marine with three more loaded guns. They had not gone above twenty yards through mud and water, the negro looking every way with uncommon vivacity, when he suddenly called out, \"Me see snakee!\" and, sure enough there the reptile lay, coiled up under the fallen leaves and rubbish of the trees. So well covered was it, that some time elapsed before the captain could perceive its head, not above <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet from him, moving its forked tongue, while its vividly-bright eyes appeared to emit sparks of fire. The captain now rested his piece upon a branch to secure a surer aim, and fired.

But mostly it was just a craze among the very wealthy, as distinguishing them from people who could afford but one set of litter-bearers. An ordinary four-man litter could be used only for going about the city--longer distances were impossible, and excursions into the country soon tired out eight bearers. For road travelling one must have sixteen bearers, two sets relieving each other in turn. Brinnaria bought <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> gigantic negroes and tested them on her inspections of her stock-farms. She tried German bearers, Goths and Cilicians. Her bearers became famous for their speed and endurance. If she heard of any squad reputed better than hers, she bought it at any price, until, not counting the teams of bearers belonging to the Palace, there was only one gang in Rome which she envied. She tried to purchase them but could not. They belonged to her mother's friend Nemestronia.

Already, in the desire to build large, high-powered machines, some remarkable craft have been produced; and one of the most striking is the Sykorsky, a huge and highly successful Russian biplane. This machine has flown to a height of 3000 feet with <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> passengers, whose combined weight was nearly a ton and a quarter. In its original form the machine had four motors, each developing 100 horse-power, which were mounted on the lower plane upon either side of the hull, one being placed behind the other and all driving independent screws. But the rear engines were afterwards brought alongside the front ones; and now, in its most recent form, the machine employs three motors, giving a total of nearly 1000 horse-power. The craft has...", "...sorely against them. It was in vain to question them further.

Against the narrow views of scholastic theologians, against the futile preoccupations of the Middle-Age materialists, against the lawyers and physicians and astrologers in vogue, he declared inexorable hostility.[24] These men, by their puerilities and falsities, obstructed the natural action of the mind; therefore Petrarch attacked them. At the same time he recognised the liberators of the reason by a kind of tact. Though he could not interpret the <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> dialogues of Plato he possessed in Greek, he perceived intuitively that Plato, as opposed to Aristotle, would become the saint of liberal philosophy, surveyed by him as in a Pisgah-view. His enthusiasm for Cicero and Virgil was twofold; in both respects he proved how capable he was of moulding the taste and directing the mental force of his successors. As an artist, he discerned in their style the harmonies of sound and the proprieties of diction, whereby Latin might once again...", "...his time in displacing Hunker office-holders with Whigs, the Democratic party was trying to reunite. It called for a bold hand. John Van Buren, with a courage born of genius, had struck it a terrible blow in the face of tremendous odds, the effect of which was as gratifying to the Barnburners as it was disastrous to the Hunkers. But, in 1849, the party professed to believe that a union of the factions would result in victory, since their aggregate vote in 1848 exceeded the Whig vote by <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> thousand.

On further examination it will appear that the high churchmen whom I take to be a decided majority of the clergy as well as a decided minority of my recommendations, have gone as a rule to the places of hard work and little pay. For example, they have got five out of ten _parochial_ recommendations; but, out of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> appointments to deaneries and canonries, they have received four, and those, with the exception of Mr. Furse, the worst.

Every thing being now ready, the embarkation of the troops commenced at the dawn of day, on the 21st. For the want of a sufficient number of boats, not more than one third of the number could embark at once. There is a range of islands extending from the head of the Peninsula to Malden. These islands render the navigation safe, and afford the army convenient depot for baggage and stores, as well as halting places. Put-in-bay island, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> miles from Portage, was selected by the General as the first point of rendezvous--the first stage in his passage across the lake. The weather was favorable. As soon as the first division of boats reached the island, men were immediately detached to take back the boats for a fresh load. Such was the eagerness of the men to accelerate the embarkation of the whole army, that they, in most cases, anticipated this regulation by volunteering their services to return with the boats....", "...{64} It often happens that a whole Irish family is crowded into one bed; often a heap of filthy straw or quilts of old sacking cover all in an indiscriminate heap, where all alike are degraded by want, stolidity, and wretchedness.

Often more than one family lived in a single damp cellar, in whose pestilent atmosphere twelve to <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> persons were crowded together. To these and other sources of disease must be added that pigs were kept, and other disgusting things of the most revolting kind were found. We must add that many families, who had but one room for themselves, receive boarders and lodgers in it, that such lodgers of both sexes by no means rarely sleep in the same bed with the married couple; and that the single case of a man and his wife and his adult sister-in-law sleeping in one bed was...", "...were need of hennes, as I ween, Yea more than seven times seventeen.

The Roman Empire was one-fourth its size; all the Russias contain an eighth less; it is <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> times as large as France, and three times as large as the United States. The United Kingdom, with its colonies and dependencies, includes about one-fifth of the entire globe. The rapidity with which population has grown in some parts of our dominion may be measured by Australasia, which in 1837 had 134,059, and in 1885, 3,278,934, or twenty-three times as many more.

In 1749 his voice broke, and the director, Georg von Reutter, took the occasion of a boyish escapade to turn him into the streets. A few friends lent him money and found him pupils, and in this way he was enabled to enter upon a rigorous course of study (he is said to have worked for <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hours a day), partly devoted to Fux's treatise on counterpoint, partly to the \"Friedrich\" and \"Wurttemberg\" sonatas of C. P. E. Bach, from which he gained his earliest acquaintance with the principles of musical structure. The first fruits of his work were a comic opera, _Der neue krumme Teufel_, and a Mass in F major (both written in 1751), the former of which was produced with success.

Through these timely precautions Chuwen, who was only <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years of age, was proclaimed emperor without any opposition, and took the title of Kien Wenti. Hongwou had rightly divined that his sons might prove a thorn in the side of his successor, and his policy of employing them in posts at a distance from the capital was only half successful in attaining its object.

His family consisted of three persons--himself, his wife, and a son, Ezekiel, familiarly known as Zeke, now <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years old. The leading family trait was meanness. Mr. Tucker supplied a mean table even for a poorhouse, and some of the hapless inmates complained bitterly. One had even had the boldness to present a complaint to the selectmen, and that body, rather reluctantly, undertook to investigate the justness of the complaint. They deputed Squire Pope to visit the poorhouse and inquire into the matter.

It appears from the _Satires_ themselves that they were written late in life; we are informed that he reached his eightieth year, and lived into the reign of Antoninus Pius. Martial, by whom he is repeatedly mentioned, alludes to him only as a rhetorician, not as a satirist. The <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> satires (of which the last is, perhaps, not genuine) were published at intervals under Trajan and Hadrian. They fall into two groups; the first nine, which are at once the most powerful and the least agreeable, being separated by a considerable interval of years from the others, in which a certain softening of tone and a tendency to dwell on the praise of virtue more than on the ignoble details of vice is united with a failing power that marks the approach of senility....", "...the best account I could; and then he bid me to fetch the two seamen to him, he walking into the house.

A downward jump of fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet, and a forward leap of seven or eight feet, had to be made at the same time. That is not much, you will say. It was not much: it was not the quantity, but it was the quality of the jump which gave to it its particular flavor. You had to hit a narrow ridge of ice.

Thus, before the mild epidemic of 1894 the death rate in the vaccinated was <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> per cent; since 1894 it has been only seven per cent; while in the unvaccinated before 1894 it was fifty-eight per cent; and since that date it has been but seventeen per cent, as reported by Welch from the statistics of 5,000 cases in the Philadelphia Municipal Hospital. =Complications.=--While a variety of disorders may follow in the course of smallpox, complications are not very frequent in even severe cases.

This permitted any individual to claim a mile square, provided it be not on a town site or water-power, and that any mission claims already made be not affected, up to the limit of six miles square. This land law was framed upon the general conception of the proposed Linn bill already brought before Congress. The land law allowed land to be taken in any form, but since there was no existing survey,...", "...encoding: ASCII *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TRADITIONS OF THE TINGUIAN *** Traditions of the Tinguian A Study in Philippine Folk-Lore By Fay-Cooper Cole Assistant Curator of Malayan Ethnology 1915 Contents Preface 3 Introduction 5 Tales of the Mythical Period 33 Ritualistic and Explanatory Tales 171 Fables 195 Abstracts 202 Preface The following myths were collected by the writer in 1907-8 during a stay of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> months with the Tinguian, a pagan tribe of northwestern Luzon in the Philippines. The material, for the most part gathered in texts, was partially translated in the Islands, while the balance was worked over during a brief visit to America in 1909. In this task I was assisted by Dumagat, a full blood Tinguian, who accompanied me. While not, in all cases, giving a literal rendering, I have endeavored to follow closely the language of the story-tellers rather than to offer a...", "...good woman was overjoyed to see Dolly so happily preferred; but when Sir Launcelot unfolded the proposed marriage, she interrupted him with a scream--\"Christ Jesus forbid--marry and amen!--match with her own brother!\" At this exclamation Dolly fainted; her lover stood with his ears erect, and his mouth wide open; Crowe stared, while the knight and his lady expressed equal surprise and concern. When Sir Launcelot entreated Mrs. Cowslip to explain this mystery, she told him, that about <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> years ago, Mr. Clarke, senior, had brought Dolly, then an infant, to her house, when she and her late husband lived in another part of the country; and as she had then been lately delivered of a child which did not live, he hired her as a nurse to the little foundling. He owned she was a love-begotten babe, and from time to time paid handsomely for the board of Dolly, who he desired might pass for her own daughter. In his last illness, he assured her he had taken care to...", "...Percy Landreth, Elsie, and Ned joining eagerly in the request; and the captain at once began. \"Fort Stephenson was built in 1812; the garrison consisted of 160 men under the command of Major George Croghan, then but twenty-one years of age. It was on the 31st of July, 1813, that it was invested by a large force of British and Indians under the command of Proctor. The fort was not a strong one; its chief defences were three block houses, circumvallating pickets from fourteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet high, and a ditch about eight feet wide and as many feet deep; they had one iron six-pounder cannon. Of course, swords and rifles were not lacking, and the men were Kentucky sharpshooters. \"General Harrison heard that the British were moving against Fort Stephenson. He had visited the fort, and felt convinced that it could not be held against an attack with heavy artillery, so had said to Major Croghan: 'Should the British approach you in force with cannon, and you can...", "...out of the north,--hanging to the tangle of spar and cordage which had once been the foremast and its gear.

The mainmast was far away, with all that pertained to it; but the solid, hard-pine jib-boom was still intact, and not one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> dories piled spoon-fashion in the four nests had been injured when the spars went by the board.

In fact, the whole country waits in virgin richness to be exploited by a wide-awake people, and now the outcome of the land falls into the hands of the Americans.

Forty cows giving milk, six hundred swine of all ages, putting on fat or doing whatever other duty came to hand, fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> hundred hens laying eggs when not otherwise engaged, three thousand apple trees striving with all their might to get large enough to bear fruit,--these made up my ideal of a factory farm; and it looked as if one year more would see it complete. No rain fell in October, and my brook became such a little brook that I dared to correct its ways. We spent a week with teams, ploughs, and scrapers, cutting the fringe and frills away from it, and reducing it to severe simplicity. It...", "...of a paper currency; secondly, the proximity of Spain, and the inferiority of Spanish manufactures, which gave to France a ready and a near market for the sale of her fine fabrics, which were paid for in the gold of the New World. In the United States, gold would have none of these subsidiary helps; on the contrary it would have to contend with a paper currency, and would have to be obtained, the product of our own mines excepted, from Mexico and South America, where it is rated as <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> to one for silver. All these circumstances, and many others, would have to be taken into consideration in fixing a standard for the United States. Mr. B. repeated that there was nicety, but no difficulty, in adjusting the relative value of gold and silver so as to retain both in circulation. Several nations of antiquity had done it; some modern nations also. The English have both in circulation at this time. The French have both, and have had for thirty years.

From Dio Cassius we learn that in Rome, at the beginning of the Empire, marriages of children under ten years occasionally took place. In some parts of the world the child-wife does not belong to her child-husband. \"Among the Reddies, of India,\" Letourneau informs us, \"a girl from <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> to twenty years of age is married to a boy of five or six. The wife then becomes the real wife of the boy's uncle, or cousin, or of the father of the reputed husband. But the latter is considered to be the legal father of the children of his pretended wife.\" So it is only when the boy has grown up that he receives his wife, and he, in turn, acts as his relative before him (100. 354). Temple cites the following curious custom in his tales of the Panjab (542. I. xviii.):-- \"When...", "...in lieu of something more entertaining. Now this beach being so far removed from Burnfield, its solitude was rarely, if ever, disturbed; therefore, great was Georgia's surprise upon reaching it, to find a shady spot under her own favorite rock already occupied. Miss Georgia came to a sudden halt, and, standing on tiptoe, gravely surveyed the new-comer, herself unseen. Under the shadow of the overhanging rock, on the warm sands, lay a tall, slight, fashionably dressed youth, of <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> or thereabouts, with handsome, regular features, a complexion of feminine fairness, a profusion of brown, curling hair, a high forehead, and unusually and aristocratically small hands and feet, the former as white as a lady's. The predominating expression of his face was a mixture of indolence and drollery; and as he lay there, with his half closed eyes, he looked the very picture of the _dolce far niente_. \"Well, now,\" thought Georgia, \"I wonder who _you_ are, and where you...", "...of Virginia had spread but three hundred miles into the interior of the country, during the last forty-three years population had spread westward more than a thousand miles.

This had now been shortened by steamboat to seven days down and <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> days up. From these considerations and the time from St. Louis to the mouth of the Columbia by steamboat and wagon, he argued that Oregon was no more distant from St. Louis in 1822 than St. Louis was twenty years before from Philadelphia. The fur-trade, the whale and seal fisheries, the trade with China, and the opportunity for agricultural occupation afforded by Oregon were all set forth.[Footnote: Annals of Cong., 17 Cong., 2 Sess., 397.] Against the proposal, his opponents...", "...like Joan of Arc, nor that she was actuated by purely lofty and unselfish motives. I believe that she was a very ardent, impulsive child, fond of trinkets, grateful for favours, absolutely uncontrolled, and with plenty of wild Indian blood in her veins. Whether or no she saved John Smith's life, she deserves our homage for her kindness in warning him of danger, in rescuing Henry Spelman, in bringing food to the colonists during the hard winter of 1608-1609. She knew John Smith for only <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> months, and yet in that brief time the two have occupied the stage to the exclusion of many noble and good men, such is the eagerness with which we welcome the romances that enliven the prosaic pages of history. She owes much of the interest attending her life to the fact that the child of a savage should be presented at court, and receive attention from the highest lords and ladies in the land.

Down around the line the yacht went until it drew up near the Minnesota on the opposite side. A launch steamed off to get the President. As he approached the Minnesota gave him twenty-one more guns. Then the fleet gave itself up to final preparations for departure. Twenty minutes later the Minnesota fired another salute to mark the President's leavetaking. He went to the Brazilian cruiser, Benjamin Constant, which, with the rest of the Brazilian ships, <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> in number, was to escort the American fleet out of the harbor. By that time the clouds had begun to descend from the hills, the wind to blow in gusts and a few raindrops to fall. It was seen that the waterfront was black with people. Then sharp dashes of rain swept over the city and hid it from view. The clouds fell upon the shore in great fog banks. The President by this time had gone to Fort Villegagnon, the naval station in the harbor half a mile from the beautiful...", "...at our work. I told the Bo's'n and the Smith to lay many strands of the vine on the floor and weave other vines in and out. \"Why can't we do that up here?\" asked Cynthia. \"I am afraid you would not make them strong enough,\" said I; \"but if you think you could, you might try.\" I felt that it would amuse them perhaps, and would make the time pass more quickly. We wove busily for an hour or two, and finally we had made eight or ten broad, closely filled mats. They were each about <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> feet long. We wove them together two and two lengthwise, and then placed some on the top of others, thus making several layers. These we bound securely together, and when we had finished we found that we had woven a broad and strong platform, which I was sure would hold a much heavier weight than that of a slight young girl. \"The most important thing now,\" said I, \"is that you should secure it well on your side. See how we have fastened these strong vines to your end of the...", "...E. F. _and_ T. D.

When one sketch is thus made, the camera is to be moved fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> inches to the right or left, and a second drawing made in the same way.

They will not be fit in less than six months. When the vinegar is boiled, let it stand to be cold, or rather lukewarm, before you put it to the lemons, and if you use more than a gallon of vinegar, increase the quantity of each ingredient in proportion. Strictly observe the direction first given, to let the lemons lie in salt fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> days, to turn them every day, and to let them be thoroughly dry before you put the pickle to them; it will be a month at least before they are sufficiently dry. _Lemons._ No. 2.

No. Mr. Hastings was ordered, and a very disagreeable and harsh order it was, to take away one half of the Nabob's allowance which he had by treaty. I do not charge Mr. Hastings with this reduction: he had nothing to do with that. Sixteen lac were cut off, and sixteen left; these two sums had been distributed, one for the support of the seraglio and the dignity of the state, the other for the court establishment and the household. The <span class=\"clocktext\">sixteen</span> lac which was left, therefore, required to be well economized, and well administered. There was a rigor in the Company's order relative to it, which was, that it should take place from an antedated time, that is, a whole year prior to the communication of their order to the Nabob. The order was, that the Nabob's stipend should be reduced to sixteen lac a year from the month of January. Mr. Hastings makes this reflection upon it, in order to leave no doubt upon your mind of his...", "...of actual military power as contrasted with spiritual dominion and popular aspiration. So far as the latter is concerned its vitality is often forgotten and its vigour underestimated. One must consider the enormous odds against which the spirit of popular emancipation had to struggle in order to appreciate the strength it developed.

This is a proud discovery for an Italian boy, as singing--especially operatic singing--is held in such high regard in Italy that one naturally looks forward with joy to a career in the great opera houses of one's native country and possibly to those over the sea.
