By half-past <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> the attack had been beaten back, with much more loss to the enemy, on this occasion, than to ourselves. On the 15th began the long series of gruelling struggles which, with varied fortunes and cruel losses, was to keep the 3rd Division under almost ceaseless strain throughout the next four weeks, until its withdrawal, with the 1st and 2nd Divisions, from the Somme area. According to the plan of operations for the great offensive on the 15th, the part assigned to the 3rd...", "...and deliberately murdered her. According to the prevalent custom, Tom Otter's corpse was hung in chains. The day selected for that purpose inaugurated a week of merry-making of the most unseemly character. Booths were pitched near the gibbet, and great numbers of the people came to see the wretch suspended. It is reported that some years later, when the jaw bones had become sufficiently bare to leave a cavity between them, a bird built its nest in this unique position. The discovery of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> young ones therein gave rise to the following triplet still quoted in the neighbourhood:-- \"There were nine tongues within the head, The tenth went out to seek some bread, To feed the living in the dead.\" The gibbet was standing until the year 1850, when it was blown down.

The last hours of Miss Macomber are thus described by Rev. S. M. Osgood, who was at Maulmain at the time of her death. The account, from the pen of one who witnessed the whole scene, will be read with deep interest. Mr. Osgood says,-- \"It becomes my painful duty to announce to you the death of our dear sister E.

Meantime, Burr had met with embarrassing delays. The promised recruits had not come in, since war had not been declared. Only two of the five boats which Jackson had agreed to build were ready.

Nevertheless, the judge bound Burr over to appear from day to day. Holding this proceeding unauthorized...", "...trade. This is not, however, the case with Nantes: it has still a brisk interior commerce, and the number of new houses are sufficient proofs that its inhabitants increase in opulence. Nantes was the residence and the burying place of the ancient Dukes of Bretagne; in the town and neighbourhood, therefore, are many of the relics of these early sovereigns. On an hill to the eastward is the castle in which these princes used to hold their court: it is still entire, though built nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> hundred years ago; and the repairs having been made in the character of the original structure, it remains a most perfect specimen of the architecture of the age in which it was built. One room, the hall or banquetting-room, as in all Gothic castles, is of an immense size, and lofty in proportion. The ornaments likewise partake of the character of the age; they are chiefly carved angels, croziers, and other sacred appendages.

That which we had weighed little more than two ounces, about the weight of a middling sized bat, and the squirrel weighs eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> ounces. However, there are some of a greater size, since we have a skin of a polatouch much larger than usual. The polatouch has some analogy with the bat by this extension of the skin, which unites the fore and hind legs, and supports him in the air; he seems also to participate of his nature, for he is quiet and sleepy in the day time, having no activity but towards the evening.

But perhaps the most interesting thing about this balloon was the structure of the car and its contents.

The cross-head and the chains, weighing more than 50 tons, descended with a fearful crash upon the press, and the tube itself fell down upon the packing beneath. Though the fall of the tube was not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> inches, it crunched solid castings, weighing tons, as if they had been nuts. The tube itself was slightly strained and deflected, though it still remained sufficiently serviceable.

I'm starting now, <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock.\" I glanced at the clock, which showed a quarter to nine. \"I'll be with you in five minutes--darling!\" I responded, throwing in the last word with immense audacity. \"_Au revoir_; I've got to hustle!\" I put up the receiver and dashed back into my bedroom, where my cold bath, fortunately, stood ready. Within five minutes I was running down the stairs, as if a sheriff and posse were after me, while Mrs. Jenkins leaned over the hand-rail and watched me, evidently under...", "...hath served the king?\" Upon which she readily made answer: \"Yes, sir; I'd die sooner than betray you.\" Being reassured at this, he ate heartily. When night fell, Richard brought him into the house again, and the king, now abandoning his intention of proceeding to London, expressed his anxiety to reach Wales where he had many friends, and which afforded him ready opportunities of escaping from the kingdom. Pendrell expressed himself willing to conduct him thither. Accordingly, about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> of the clock, they set out with the determination of crossing the Severn, intending to pass over a ferry between Bridgenorth and Shrewsbury. When they had walked some hours they drew near a water-mill. \"We could see the miller,\" said the king in relating the story, \"as I believe, sitting at the mill-door, he being in white clothes, it being a very dark night. He called out sturdily, 'Who goes there?' Upon which Richard Pendrell answered, 'Neighbours going home,' or suchlike words....", "...is taken of this custom, either of tobacco or the pipe in the Verrazzano letter. The most remarkable omission of all is of the bark canoe. This light and beautiful fabric was peculiar to the Algonkin tribes. It was not found among the southern Indians, much less in the West India islands. Its buoyancy and the beauty of its form were such as to render it an object of particular observation. Though so light as to be capable of being borne on a man's shoulders, it would sometimes carry <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> men, and ride with safety over the most stormy sea. It was always from the first a great object of interest with the discoverers of the northerly parts of the coast, which they manifested by taking them back to Europe, as curiosities. Aubert carried one of them to Dieppe in 1508, and Captain Martin Fringe, who was one of the first to visit the shores of Cape Cod, took one, in 1603, thence to Bristol, which he thus describes, as if he saw no other kind. \"Their boats whereof we...", "...down and pray to God to give you strength in the future to stand against temptation.\" Mrs. Barfield took Esther's hand and they knelt down by the round table, leaning their hands on its edge. And, in a high, clear voice, Mrs. Barfield prayed aloud, Esther repeating the words after her-- \"Dear Lord, Thou knowest all things, knowest how Thy servant has strayed and has fallen into sin. But Thou hast said there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> just men. Therefore, Lord, kneeling here before Thee, we pray that this poor girl, who repents of the evil she has done, may be strengthened in Thy mercy to stand firm against temptation. Forgive her sin, even as Thou forgavest the woman of Samaria.

Effie snatched it out of her hand. \"All right, Grannie. Half a sec. more!

Effie wiped the blackboard with frantic speed, but not before Vivien had caught a clear view of her portrait. She glared first at Effie, who had skipped back to her place, then at the <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> other conscious faces. Finally she announced: \"You'll every one of you report yourselves to me at four o'clock this afternoon. I shall expect you in the handicraft room, and you'll each bring a poetry book with you.

The use of this enormously elongated penis obviously is, that the spermatozoa of these males, which are so extremely small in size, compared to the female, should all be conveyed within the sack, and none be lost. It should be borne in mind, that the whole male, including every part, is scarcely larger than a single ovum, of which sometimes sixty have to be impregnated by only two or three males.

Years later, this butler, Joshua Queeney, 'a much enfeebled old man,' retold and enlarged the tale of the enormous consumption of his best wine; with a sacred oath to confirm it, and a tear expressive of elegiacal feelings.

Taking the cubit or ell at its lowest estimate, that is eighteen inches, each slab, being nine feet long, <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> feet wide, and four and a half feet thick, would weigh upward of twenty-eight tons, reckoning thirteen cubic feet to the ton,--the right estimate for such stone as is quarried from the Sinaitic cliff.

The clock, like everything in his rooms, was costly, a little ornate, and suggestive of an owner whose intention aimed frankly at the original.

This vastly amused the spectators, and even broke down their studied and courtly gravity and surprised them into laughter. Of course the seconds struck up the swords and started the duel over again. At the word, the deluge of blows began, but before long the surgeon once more interfered--for the only reason which ever permits him to interfere--and the day's war was over. It was now two in the afternoon, and I had been present since half past <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> in the morning. The field of battle was indeed a red one by this time; but some sawdust soon righted that. There had been one duel before I arrived. In it one of the men received many injuries, while the other one escaped without a scratch. I had seen the heads and faces of ten youths gashed in every direction by the keen two-edged blades, and yet had not seen a victim wince, nor heard a moan, or detected any fleeting expression which confessed the sharp pain the hurts were...", "...or four leagues. As we approached Point Pearce the soundings were very irregular and generally upon a rocky bottom. We passed many ripplings occasioned by the tide setting round the point and meeting the other tide from the southward. As these eddies were driving us towards the shore we steered off south-west. At six o'clock p.m. Point Pearce bore North 65 degrees East eleven miles, and in a line with the hills about Mount Goodwin. Between this time and noon the soundings were between <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> and thirty-two fathoms, upon a rocky bottom.

Blake came up in the night with eighteen ships. The Dutch tried to draw off, but at eight o'clock we came up to them, and, after fighting for four hours, they hauled off and ran, in great confusion, for the flats, where we could not follow them, and so they escaped to Zeeland.

While it requires many wheels to work the machine, some are large, some small, but all are dangerous. Men becoming infatuated with politics, the desire to hold office leads them from paths of rectitude.

One man may succeed in reaching the summit of his ambition, but it is by climbing over the ruins of the <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> hundred and ninety-nine fallen on the highway. The fight for spoils develops bad passions, creates schisms in parties.

The position of Sangar Strait, between Yezo and Niphon, being very uncertain, Kruzenstern resolved to determine it.

It was soon discovered that such was not the design of Great Britain, and satisfactory explanations of the real objects of the measure have been given both here and in London.

In 1845 this exclusion was relaxed so far as concerns the Bay of Fundy, but the just and liberal intention of the home Government, in compliance with what we think the true construction of the convention, to open all the other outer bays to our fishermen was abandoned in consequence of the opposition of the colonies. Notwithstanding this, the United...", "...said he was still taking his siesta. We had time to look at the only objects of interest in the village, and these were the wells, which, after our straits at Chunhuhu, were a refreshing spectacle, and of which our horses had already enjoyed the benefit by a bath.

From time immemorial, nine wells formed at this place the centre of a population, and these <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> wells are now in the plaza of the village. Their origin is as obscure and unknown as that of the ruined cities which strew the land, and as little thought of. These wells were circular openings cut through a stratum of rock.

The Finns took 1,560 officers and soldiers prisoner, while their captures included four trench mortars, <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> machine guns, and one bomb thrower. The Cheshskoslovatsky brigade captured sixty-two officers and 3,150 soldiers, fifteen guns and many machine guns. Many of the captured guns were turned against the former owners.

In his _History of Fife_, published in 1710, Sir Robert Sibbald has both drawn and described it. \"It is (says he) made like a coffin, and very fierce and grim faces are done on both the ends of it. Upon the middle stone which supports it, there is the figure of a man holding a spear in his hand.\"[42] He might have added that on the corresponding middle part of the opposite side there is sculptured a rude cross;...", "...of the devil in producing diseases through the aid of old women. The prosecution against this class raged with unusual violence in Scotland under the covenanters. To deny the existence of especially evil supernatural powers, in old women, was held as an evidence of skepticism exposing the doubting person to like suspicion. Great numbers of women were put to death at a time; so common indeed was the sight as to cause but little comment. A Scotch traveler casually mentioned having seen <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> women burning together at Bath in 1664. Knox himself suffered a woman to be burned at St. Andrews whom one word from him would have saved. Father Tanner speaks of \"the multitude\" of witches who were daily brought under the torture that was constantly practiced by the church. The reformers were more cruel than those from whose superstitious teachings they professed to have escaped. All the tortures of the old church were repeated and an unusual number of new and diabolical ones...", "...some sea-snakes every day, so this day we saw a great many, of two different sorts or shapes. One sort was yellow, and about the bigness of a man's wrist, about four feet long, having a flat tail about four fingers broad. The other sort was much smaller and shorter, round, and spotted black and yellow. This day we sounded several times, and had forty-five fathom, sand. We did not make the land till noon, and then saw it first from our topmast head; it bore south- east by east about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> leagues distance, and it appeared like a cape or head of land. The sea breeze this day was not so strong as the day before, and it veered out more, so that we had a fair wind to run in with to the shore, and at sunset anchored in twenty fathom, clean sand, about five leagues from the Bluff point, which was not a cape (as it appeared at a great distance), but the easternmost end of an island about five or six leagues in length, and one in breadth. There were three or four rocky...", "...the ribs distant from each other: I have seen six or seven ribs on the rostrum alone.

His wife only guessed how he suffered, but even she was mistaken in believing that his heart ached for the loss of his friend alone.

Not till <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock, and weary with the many services of the day, had the priest returned home, eating a mouthful of supper, and retiring to his study. Thither his wife followed him presently, establishing herself with her needlework in silence.

She had often thus watched him occupied in holy meditation, and the inward peace...", "...obtained by magneto-electric induction in a few feet of wire is of but small intensity, and has not yet been observed except in metals, and carbon in a particular state, still it has power to pass through brine (23.); and, as increased length in the substance acted upon produces increase of intensity, I hoped to obtain effects from extensive moving masses of water, though quiescent water gave none. I made experiments therefore (by favour) at Waterloo Bridge, extending a copper wire <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> hundred and sixty feet in length upon the parapet of the bridge, and dropping from its extremities other wires with extensive plates of metal attached to them to complete contact with the water.

Their fire was badly directed, and most of the bombs burst too soon or too late. The besieged became accustomed to them, and kept out of their way when they saw them coming. For a dozen bombs fired the first evening, two men were wounded, and one gun-carriage damaged. On the morning of the 25th of November the weather, hitherto fine, suddenly changed. About <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> a fine snow fell, and was soon after followed by a deluge of rain, accompanied by squalls. During the night of the 15th, the men on guard in the trenches were up to their knees in water; it was impossible to work. The rain continued regular and heavy during the whole of the 16th.

In these beds foot-prints, referred to three species of quadrupeds, have lately been detected, all of them five-toed and in double rows, with an opposite symmetry, as if made by right and left feet, while they likewise display the alternation of fore foot and hind foot. One species, the largest of the three, presents a diameter for each foot-print of about two inches, and shows the fore and hind feet to be nearly equal in dimensions. It exhibits a length of stride of about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> inches, and a breadth between the right and left treads of nearly four inches. The impressions of the hind feet are but little in the rear of the fore feet. The animal which made them is supposed to have been allied to a Saurian, rather than to a Batrachian or Chelonian; but more information is required before so difficult a point can be decided.

It was visible for the long period of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> months, and was conspicuously prominent to the naked eye during September, but these facts, though note-worthy, would not have called for particular remark, had not the comet exhibited some special peculiarities which distinguished it from all others.

As soon as Mademoiselle de Verneuil had turned the creaking hinges of the lower door she smelt an intolerable ammoniacal odor, and saw that the beasts in the stable had kicked through the inner partition which separated the stable from the dwelling. The interior of the farmhouse, for such it was, did not belie its exterior. Mademoiselle de Verneuil was asking herself how it was possible for human beings to live in such habitual filth, when a ragged boy about eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> years old suddenly presented his fresh and rosy face, with a pair of fat cheeks, lively eyes, ivory teeth, and a mass of fair hair, which fell in curls upon his half-naked shoulders. His limbs were vigorous, and his attitude had the charm of that amazement and naive curiosity which widens a child's eyes. The little fellow was a picture of beauty. \"Where is your mother?\" said Marie, in a gentle voice, stooping to kiss him between the eyes. After receiving her kiss the child...", "...above followed intently.

For this purpose, since no direct attack was intended, the guns were of more importance than the infantry--and indeed the infantry should, one might imagine, have been used solely as an escort for the artillery. A desultory and inconclusive action ensued which continued from <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> in the morning until half-past one in the afternoon. A well-directed fire of the Boer guns from the hills was dominated and controlled by our field artillery, while the advance of their riflemen was restrained by shrapnel. The enemy's guns were more easily marked down than at Elandslaagte, as they used black powder. The ranges varied from three to four thousand yards.

When they came into the sitting-room, where Bruce and Morton were talking together, Mrs. Sanford asked Graves to lend her a dollar, but he refused. \"Pshaw! I don't want it,\" she replied. \"I only asked to see whether you'd lend it, as I have quite enough of my own;\" and, so saying, she took out her pocket-book. Morton saw her count out <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> ten-dollar bills and nine one-dollar bills. From the fact that she showed just ninety-nine dollars, it was probable that she had only recently changed one of the one-hundred-dollar bills taken from young Trafton.

If these two swans could have continued on to Norfolk Island, which is about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> hundred miles from Australia, and, after arriving there, could have recovered their health, made a nest, and reared a brood of young ones, then there might have been black swans in Norfolk Island as well as in Australia.

I think Mr. Ford brought in four rats and had one coon foot. That evening Mr. Ford went home to raise his nets, and when he came back he brought in two mink; I got two coon. Mr. Ford went home again and made arrangements for a team to come in and move us out to \"pastures new.\" He also brought another mink, and I believe that we got two or three coons that night. I think we got nine rats, four mink and eight coons in the three nights with about twenty traps. The land...", "...for, by asy and very ignoble means. My father--for all this time, though I have never mentioned him, I had a father living--my father, being in public life, and much occupied with the affairs of the nation, had little leisure to attend to his family. A great deal went on in his house, without his knowing any thing about it. He had heard of my being ill and well, at different hours of the day; but had left it to the physicians and my mother to manage me till a certain age: but now I was <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> years old, he said it was time I should be taken out of the hands of the women; so he inquired more particularly into my history, and, with mine, he heard the story of Simon and the Jews. My mother said she was glad my father's attention was at last awakened to this extraordinary business. She expatiated eloquently upon the medical, or, as she might call them, magical effects of sympathies and antipathies: on the nervous system; but my father was not at all addicted to a belief in...", "...even to the extremest party, led, we supposed, chiefly by Mr. Sidney. But I murmured that it was a shame that His Majesty treated him so; and while I was listening to further eulogies on His Grace, a new thought came to me which I determined to put into execution that very night; for I felt we were not making any progress. There was not much more conversation of any significance, and I was soon able to carry out what I determined; for my Lord Essex when we broke about half-past <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock, again offered to take me home. I said good-night very respectfully to the company; and followed him into the coach. For a while I said nothing, but appeared preoccupied; so that at last my Lord clapped me on the knee and asked me if I ailed--which was what I wished him to do. \"My Lord,\" said I, with an appearance of great openness, \"I have a confession to make.\" \"Well?\" said he. \"What is it?\" \"I am disappointed,\" I said. \"There is a deal of talk; and most...", "...induce the larger grocers, and even the average grocers, to purchase their coffee already roasted. Coffees were roasted in the old style, \"pull-out\" roaster cylinder. That is to say, it was necessary to stop the roaster and to pull out the cylinder to sample the coffee in order to know when to take the coffee off the fire. When the coffee was ready to take off, the cylinder was pulled out its entire length. It was then turned over and a slide <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> inches wide, running the full length of the cylinder, was opened and the contents were dumped in the cooling box. When the coffee reached the cooling box, it took two men with hoes or wooden shovels to stir and turn it until it was properly cooled, there being no cooling arrangements then as we have nowadays. At that time there were no stoning or separating machines; and as a bag of the ordinary green Jamaica coffee contained from three...", "...is fatal, there is an end of all: the bruised bodies are washed up; the women wring their hands, and the old men walk about silently. But if things go well, then the fisherman's old age is comfortable enough.

The \"Halicore\" ran into harbour one October morning and took up her berth at the quay. The brig had come from a <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> months' voyage and the men were regarded as heroes when they came ashore, for most of our vessels were merely coasters. When all was made snug on board, the sailors went to their homes and received the admiring homage of the neighbours. One young man whose parents lived in a cottage away to the north was very keen to get home. He had a weary stretch of moorland to pass, and the evening was wild, with only fitful gleams of moonlight to brighten the dark, but the young sailor would...", "...And the Psalmist says of Him, \"The Lord is my Shepherd, therefore can I lack nothing. He shall feed me in a green pasture, and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort[13].\" And he addresses Him, \"Hear, O thou Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep, show Thyself also, Thou that sittest upon the Cherubims[14].\" And He Himself says in a parable, speaking of Himself, \"What man of you having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing[15].\" Observe, my brethren, it is here said that Christ, the Lord of Angels, condescends to lay the lost sheep on His shoulders: in a former passage of the Prophet Isaiah it was said that He should \"gather them with His arm, and carry them in His bosom.\" By carrying them in His bosom is meant the love He bears them, and the fulness of His...", "...with all the panels open, on account of the excessive heat of the summer months. In wet weather these panels are covered with leather aprons, which are fixed on with battons, a very insufficient protection in the winter, as the wind blows through the intermediate spaces, whistling into your ears, and rendering it more piercing than if all was open. Moreover, they are no protection against the rain or snow, both of which find their way in to you. The coach has three seats, to receive <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> passengers; those on the middle seat leaning back upon a strong and broad leather brace, which runs across. This is very disagreeable, as the centre passengers, when the panels are closed, deprive the others of the light and air from the windows.

Further than that, it occupied such a position that a trench little more than a quarter of a mile in length and averaging a depth of about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> feet was all that was needed to drain the swamp by carrying off the water and discharging it into a valley some three-hundred feet deep. An alternative scheme which Earle also investigated was the diversion of the stream which supplied the swamp with water; and this was also found possible by cutting a trench about two hundred yards long; but it was open to the objection that, in order to do it, the workers would be obliged to walk a distance of nearly twelve miles daily to and...", "...the stock-exchange abbreviation for Sugar, I winced, as one does at the dentist's probe--well, I could not stand it. I determined to put up Sugar--that is, I determined to try. Little the woman knew what she asked when she wrote: \"You will put up Sugar?\" She had read that a stock operator works magic, but it had never entered her head that his wand was a stick of dynamite a thousand times concentrated--a stick of dynamite that the law of stock-market averages shows goes off in his hand <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> out of every ten times it is handled, and that when it goes off there is nothing more for the handler but the minister, the flowers, and the head-stone; indeed, often the explosion leaves nothing with which to buy even a head-stone!

He even served the very worst part of the bird to the simple Amedee, as he would force him to choose the <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> of spades. Then he poured out the chambertin, and once more all heads became excited, and the conversation fell, as was inevitable, upon the subject of women.

One moment out of all that had happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment when I struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look of torture. And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a distorted smile she had at that moment! But I did not know then, that fifteen years later I should...", "...not proceed, and returned again the same night. Then Parker, Smith, Townsend, Purpet, and five others, desired that they might go by land, and that the boat might fetch them from the shore opposite the isle, being scarcely a mile across.

But these <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> men were never more heard of. On the 11th, when most of our men were at the island, only the captain, master, and five more remaining in the ship, there came a great multitude of savages to the shore beside the ship, throwing dust into the air, leaping and running about like so many beasts, having vizards on their faces like dogs, or else their faces actually resembled dogs. We greatly feared they would have set the ship on fire, for they would suddenly make fire, at which we were...", "...powers, Sir John Macdonald opposed it as meaning separation and independence, ending his speech with the declaration, 'A British subject I was born, a British subject I hope to die.'

This was to be done as soon as convenient in each Province.

The really great discoveries which link the \"Great North-West\" for all time in history with France and French names were initiated by PIERRE GAULTIER DE LA VERENDRYE, who was born in 1685 at the town of Three Rivers, in Lower Canada, where his father was Governor. He entered the army at the age of twelve, and took part in the French campaigns in Flanders, winning the rank of lieutenant at the battle of Malplaquet, where he received <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> wounds and was left for dead on the field. He then returned to Canada, not having the necessary means with which to support the position of a lieutenant; and then, as France seemed to have entered upon a period of protracted peace, he determined to become an explorer.

In 1859, having attained his majority, he removed to Walla Walla county to start in the business world independently, settling on the present site of Huntsville, where he successfully engaged in farming and in the raising of live stock until 1884. He then removed to Whitman county, where he purchased a place three miles north of Hay and there carried on general agricultural pursuits for sixteen years. His success as a cattle man and a farmer continued and he acquired...", "...the ravine where there is a cross, is it not?\" If Honorine had been next to Agathe, she would have pinched her viciously, to make her regret her question, but their escort separated them; so that she could only make a convulsive movement, which she instantly checked, pretending that she had made a misstep. \"Yes, mademoiselle,\" replied Paul curtly, \"that is the ravine of the cross.\" \"We have been told a very sad story about that cross--that a young man was found dead on that spot, <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten years ago, I believe.

I think that death, unaccompanied with cruelty, should be the utmost exertion of human authority over our unhappy fellow-creatures.\" Torments, however, were always inflicted in these cases.

But horrible as the excesses might have been, which occasioned these punishments, it must be remembered, that they were committed by ignorant savages, who had been dragged from all they held most dear; whose patience had been exhausted by a cruel and loathsome confinement during their transportation; and whose resentment had been wound up to the highest pitch of fury by the lash of the driver.

Indeed, it is an outrage upon Nature herself, for Nature loves her margins even more than I do. She goes in for margins on a truly stupendous scale. She wants a bird, so a dozen are hatched. She knows perfectly well that eleven out of the twelve are merely margin. She will throw them to the cats, and the foxes, and the weasels, and the snakes, and only keep the best of the batch. She wants a tree, so she plants a hundred. She knows that ninety and <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> are margin, to be browsed down by cattle, but she means to make sure of her one. 'The roe of a cod,' Grant Alien tells me, 'contains nearly ten million eggs; but, if each of those eggs produced a young fish which arrived at maturity, the whole sea would immediately become a solid mass of closely packed cod-fish.'

It was flowing down along a bald-top mountain back from our camp at the beaver pond, and looked like gray smoke. The sun was just being swallowed.

There was but one that interested him, and this he examined intently, almost excitedly. It represented a little girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten years,--Alice, undoubtedly,--with her arms clasped about the neck of a magnificent St. Bernard dog and looking up into the handsome features of a tall, slender, dark-eyed, black-haired boy of sixteen or thereabouts; and the two were enough alike to be brother and sister.

A very short distance brought him to an open glade in the wood, where he beheld four men contending with a party of at least <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten. Two of the four were dismounted at the very instant of Weseloff's arrival; one of these he recognized almost certainly as the Khan, who was fighting hand to hand, but at great disadvantage, with two of the adverse horsemen. Seeing that no time was to be lost, Weseloff fired, and brought down one of the two. His companions discharged their carbines at the same moment, and then all rushed simultaneously into the little open area.

Satisfied with Eggleston's answers, Davis sat in thought a moment, and then continued: \"I am anxious to send some one through the entire line of the Confederate armies in such a way that he will be present at all the great battles and end up at the battle of Gettysburg.

Three hundred years ago these trees were laid out and planted so close that, save for openings above the lower trunk, where the trees begin to narrow, the space on each side of the roadway is solidly walled by cedar bases. We have seen nothing to compare, in uniformity and distance, with the two rows of cryptomeria at and below Nikko. Pine and other trees grow all about, and rivers, cascades, and inviting glens all go to make the surroundings very attractive....", "...declared on Jehu's side. It might be expected to feel some gratitude to the dynasty which Jehu had supplanted, seeing that it owed to the grandfather of the king whom he had just slain its very existence as the capital of Israel. He would put a bold face on his usurpation, and strike while the iron was hot. He would not rouse opposition by seeming to assume that Samaria would accept his rebellion. He therefore wrote a letter to the rulers of Samaria[197]--which was but a journey of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> hours' distance from Jezreel--and to the guardians of the young princes, reminding them that they were masters in a strong city, protected with its own contingent of chariots and horses, and well supplied with armour. He suggested that they should select the most promising of Ahab's sons, make him king, and begin a civil war on his behalf. The event showed how prudent was this line of conduct. As yet Jehu had not transferred the army from Ramoth-Gilead. He had doubtless taken...", "...signals and act accordingly. In case signals cannot be seen or clearly understood, no captain can do wrong if he places his ship alongside that of an enemy.\" One of the last orders of this admirable man was that the name and family of every officer, seaman, and marine who might be killed or wounded in action, should be, as soon as possible, returned to him, in order to be transmitted to the chairman of the patriotic fund, for the benefit of the sufferer or his family.

The history of man seems to run back into a far distant and gloomy past. Except for the poetical account in Genesis and the traditions of various peoples throughout the world, real history fades away into an earlier time of which there are no written records.

But seven or eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> thousand years are as nothing in comparison with the age of the earth, which runs back into a past so limitless that no man can safely assign any set figure to it. In a recent paper, Dr. Walcott, of the Smithsonian Institution, says that the antiquity of the earth must be measured not in millions, for they are too short, nor hundreds of millions, for this carries us too far, but must surely be measured in tens of millions of years.

He and Hamilton had much in common, and to some degree he took Laurens's place; not entirely, for Laurens's idealism gave him a pedestal in Hamilton's memory which no other man but Washington ever approached; and Morris was...", "...of the Universe, it is open and well-known unto Thee that with these ten fingers I have labored without ceasing in the law, and never sought after any worldly profit with even so much as my little finger; may it therefore please Thee that there may be peace in my rest!\" A voice from heaven immediately responded (Isa. lvii. 2), \"He shall enter peace: they shall rest in their beds.\" Ibid., fol. 104, col. 2.

She wanted fresh provisions and flour; so our captain gave her potatoes, bananas, and turkeys. Being so much becalmed ourselves, our captain did not dare to give them flour, as we might come short, and they had plenty of hard bread. It quite revived our courage, for what were our <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> days compared with their sixty days? And we had plenty of provisions and good company. We saw a great many flying-fish every day. These are small, and have their forward fins so long that they serve them as wings skimming along on the surface of the water.

The era of Elsa began. Old Prince Hammerfeldt had left a successor behind him in the person of his nephew, Baron von Bederhof, and this gentleman was now my Chancellor and my chief official adviser. He was a portly man of about fifty, with red cheeks and black hair. He was high in favour with my mother, the husband of a buxom wife, and the father of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> children. As is not unusual in cases of hereditary succession, he was adequate to his office, although he would certainly not have been selected for it unless he had been his uncle's nephew; but, being the depositary of Hammerfeldt's traditions (although not of his brains), he contrived to pass muster. He came at this time to Artenberg, and urged on me the necessity of a speedy marriage. \"The recent danger, so providentially averted,\" he said, \"is a stronger argument than any I...", "...appeared their Colours flying.

We waited the first onset; in a few minutes the firing commenced in all quarters, which lasted from four o'clock in the afternoon, till near <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> at night. They endeavoured to break our square in every quarter, but like true Soldiers we cleaved together and repelled them; they stormed our little line twice, but were beat back with slaughter; they drove their dismounted horses to the mouths of the Cannon in order to shelter themselves, but the grape shot made them fall on every side; they even set the town on fire in order to annoy us with the smoak, but the wind at the order of _our God_ turned, drove it from us, and...", "...instantly a heavy broadside was poured into the \"Defence.\" A sharp action followed, lasting for nearly an hour. The \"Defence\" bore the brunt of the conflict, for the four schooners did not come to sufficiently close quarters to be of much assistance against the enemy. The gunnery of the Americans proved too much for the enemy, however; and after losing eighteen men, together with a large number wounded, the British surrendered. The American vessel was a good deal cut up aloft, and lost <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> of her men. The next morning a third transport was sighted by the \"Defence,\" and speedily overhauled and captured. More than five hundred British soldiers were thus captured; and the British thenceforward dared not treat the Americans as rebels, lest the colonial army authorities should retaliate upon the British prisoners in their hands.

In the morning they were intrenching themselves, when they were greeted by a brisk fire from the edge of the woods. It came from a party of Indians, whom the rangers presently put to flight, and, imitating their own ferocity, scalped <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> of them. Wolfe came over to the camp on the next day, went with an escort to the heights opposite Quebec, examined it with a spy-glass, and chose a position from which to bombard it. Cannon and mortars were brought ashore, fascines and gabions made, intrenchments thrown up, and batteries planted.

She also said that I should become a widow when no longer young but not too old to marry again which I should do.

A number of these ancient epics form what is termed the Trojan Cycle, because all relate in some way to the War of Troy.

The Iliad (of which a synopsis is given) follows this epic, taking up the story where the wrath of Achilles is aroused and ending it with the funeral of Hector. This, however, does not conclude the story of the Trojan War, which is resumed in the \"Aethiopia,\" in five books, by Arctinus of Miletus. After describing the arrival of Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons, to aid the Trojans, the poet relates her death at the hand of Achilles, who, in his turn,...", "...nor yet that of the twelve pounds of ruddy gold in Ecke's girdle prevailed on Theodoric, who said again and again: \"I will fight thee gladly when day dawns, but not here in the darkness, where neither of us can see his foe\".

Answer, 360 pounds. Our next question is: If, in six pounds of acids in a normal must, 754 pounds of water appear, how much water is required for nine pounds of acids? Answer, 1,131 pounds. As, therefore, the must which we intend to improve by neutralizing its acids, should contain 360 pounds of sugar, nine pounds of acids, and 1,131 pounds of water, but contains already 150 pounds of sugar, 9 pounds of acids, and 841 pounds of water, there remain to be added, 210...", "...and a large number of pistillate blossoms and later a good crop of nuts which is fairly good evidence that it must have fertilized itself.

Approximately <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> tenths of the proceeds of American agriculture goes to nourish the quadruped, and man eats the remaining one tenth; therefore, if we want to get clear of the possibility of a crop being overproduced, let us grow something the beast can eat. To say that we will never overproduce food crops for man is ridiculous. It is quite possible, for instance, that we may produce too many Persian walnuts for man's food, but the tree that will produce nuts to feed the beasts is on a firm basis....", "...too, that women, moved by the preaching of \"the Perfected,\" condemned their unconverted husbands to an enforced celibacy. This was one of the results of the neo-Manichean teachings. Moreover, they carried their principles so far as to consider it a crime even to touch a woman. They forbade a man to sit next to a woman except in case of necessity. \"If a woman touches you,\" said Pierre Autier, \"you must fast three days on bread and water; and if you touch a woman, you must fast <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> days on the same diet.\" At the ceremony of the _consolamentum_, the Bishop who imposed hands on the future sister took great care not to touch her, even with the end of his finger; to avoid doing so, he always covered the postulant with a veil.

The captains of the two boats, for some reason or other, lashed their vessels together, side by side, and in this manner we made the greater part of the trip. In going up the Cumberland the regiment lost two men by drowning; Henry Miner, of Co. D, and Perry Crochett, of Co. G. There was something of a mystery in regard to the death of Miner. He was last seen about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock one evening on the lower deck of the boat, close to where the two boats were lashed together. It was supposed that in some manner he missed his footing and fell between the boats, and was at once sucked under by the current and drowned. His cap was discovered next morning on the deck near the place where he was last observed, but no other vestige of him was ever found. The other soldier, Perry Crochett, stumbled and fell into the river in the day time, from the after part...", "...the Genies in beauty of form; and though not moulded of such light materials as the mother, their corporeal structure was finer than the dull earthy clay of the father.

Such a mock suicide he could perpetrate at will, and whenever he needed it in his dramas, as an affecting theatre poet; oftenest, however, he and the Leipsic blockhead inflicted this death upon themselves in effigy, when among a lot of ladies they had singled out to visit that one who was most in love with them.

The auditing system in vogue is as old as the Government and the methods used are antiquated. There are six Auditors and seven Assistant Auditors for the <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> departments, and under the present system the only function which the Auditor of a department exercises is to determine, on accounts presented by disbursing officers, that the object of the expenditure was within the law and the appropriation made by Congress for the purpose on its face, and that the calculations in the accounts are correct. He does not examine the merits of the transaction or determine the reasonableness of the price paid for the articles purchased, nor does he...", "...Yet she, herself, how full her life was; how fast the world went on! \"And we forget because we _must_ And not because we will,\" thought Flossy, and in this mood Violante's tears had surely met with warm sympathy.

On the evening of that day, a mob assembled in St. James's-street and its vicinity, and about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock the concerted signal was given by a number of men riding furiously through various parts of the city. Outrage followed; the chief justice of Ireland, Lord Kilwarden, was stabbed to death with pikes, Colonel Brown was shot, and others were wounded.

In 1829 a court theatre, as has been said, was opened. Rosalie came as a leading lady, and one Heinrich Dorn came as musical director. Dorn was nine years older than Richard at a time of life when <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> years make an immense difference; but the elder, certainly through the influence of Rosalie, from the beginning took a keen interest in the younger. He played Richard's music at the theatre--to his own confusion on at least one occasion.

Though long before this time the library of the Popes was of considerable importance, yet on account of the immense number of volumes produced by Nicholas V. he is generally regarded as the founder of the Vatican Library. The number of volumes which it contained at the time of his death is variously estimated at from one to <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> thousand. The works of the Fathers of the Church, and the Scholastics and Canonists were well represented.[9] After the death of Nicholas V. the Pagan side of the Humanist movement became more and more apparent. Pius II. (1458-64), who, as Aeneas Sylvius, was well known as a clever writer of the Humanist school, seems as Pope to have been decidedly suspicious of his former friends. His own private library was filled with Christian authors, and care was taken to show favour only...", "...a considerable sum of money in this way, and finally ran his boat regularly between the island and the city.

His wife was a woman of more than usual character, and aided him nobly in making his way in the world. This admirable couple were blessed with <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> children. The oldest of these, CORNELIUS, the subject of this sketch, was born at the old farm-house on Staten Island, on the 27th of May, 1794. He was a healthy, active boy, fond of all manner of out-door sports, and manifesting an unusual repugnance to the confinement and labors of the school-room. He has since declared that the only books he remembers using at school were the New Testament and the spelling-book. The result was, that he merely learned to read, write, and cipher,...", "...Terrible execrations broke from the Oriental's lips, as he hurled his body against the iron bars of his prison cell. Demoniacal yells waked the silent echoes. The other prisoners, alarmed and rendered restless, soon joined in, and soon the dark vaults of the Emperor's Tomb resounded with a veritable pandemonium, a chorus of the damned that caused Tristan to put his fingers to his ears lest he, too, go mad. At nine o'clock that night the last visit was to be paid the prisoners. At <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock Maraglia, the Castellan, came, attended by the guard, which waited outside. The Castellan was in a state of nervous excitement. As he entered Tristan's cell he looked about, as if he dreaded a listener, then he approached his prisoner and whispered something into his ear. For a moment Tristan knew not what has happening to him.

Sixty-one years are not threescore and ten, being <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> years short.

Consciousness of nutritive functions is always painful, and digestion, quite as well as ovulation, may become a process most disturbing to cerebral tranquility and efficiency.

The ovaries are decidedly active during at least fifteen days of every month; the stomach, during three or four hours after each meal, or from <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> to twelve hours a day. As a matter of fact the digestive function is much more often the occasion of conscious discomfort, than is the function of ovulation. Whenever it becomes so, the dyspeptic approaches the condition of the reptiles or ruminating animals, in whom the process of digestion so absorbs the powers of the nervous system that all other modes of its activity are suspended.

Yet, after all, at this time of day, it seems more of a compliment than a gibe. To be a whole ninth of a man! Few of _us_, when we ponder it, can boast so much. Take, for instance, that other proverbial case of the fractional-part-of-a-pin-maker. It takes <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> persons to make a pin, we were taught in our catechism. Actually that means that it takes nine persons to make one whole pin-maker, which leaves the question still to be solved as to how many whole pin-makers it takes to make a man. What is the relation of one pin-maker to the whole social economy? That discovered, a multiplication by nine will give us the exact fractional part of manhood which belongs to the ninth-of-a-pin-maker.

It may have been merely a whim on her part, but she held tenaciously to her belief, acted in accordance with it, and no one could dissuade her from it.

So, laying down our rods on the rocks, we walked up to the beach--just in time to see two \"goanners\"--one of them with a wriggling mullet in his mouth--scamper off into the bush. A careful search revealed the harrowing fact that <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> of the twelve fish were missing, and the multitudinous criss-cross tracks on the sand showed the cause of their disappearance. My sister sat down on a hollow log and wept, out of sheer vexation of spirit, while I lit a fire to boil the billy and grill the three remaining mullet.

Then on September 29--that is, only <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten days after the receipt of the French dispatch--we have this most important dispatch, which I shall read at some little length. It is at p. 136, and is really addressed to the Diet. The Secretary of State says: Her Majesty's Government, by the Treaty of London of May 8, 1852, is bound to respect the integrity and independence of Denmark. The Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia have taken the same engagement. Her Majesty could not see with indifference a...", "...Samson among us to do so great a feat?\" \"Lay me thy ships alongside mine, king, close to this barricaded bridge,\" said the valorous boy, \"and I will vow to break it down, or ye may call me caitiff and coward.\" \"Be it so,\" said Ethelred, the English king; and all the war-chiefs echoed: \"Be it so!\" So Olaf and his trusty Rane made ready the war-forces for the destruction of the bridge. Old London Bridge was not what we should now call an imposing structure, but our ancestors of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> centuries back esteemed it quite a bridge. The chronicler says that it was \"so broad that two wagons could pass each other upon it,\" and \"under the bridge were piles driven into the bottom of the river.\" So young Olaf and old Rane put their heads together, and decided to wreck the bridge by a bold viking stroke. And this is how it is told in the \"Heimskringla,\" or Saga of King Olaf the Saint: \"King Olaf ordered great platforms of floating wood to be tied together with hazel...", "...Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa.

Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly.

However, if the company is a potent antagonist, thus far it is an eligible one, that, in the event of losing the suit, the honorable company is solvent; and such an event, after some <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten years' delay, did really befall the company. The question at issue respected some docks which Colonel Watson had built for the company in some Indian port. And in the end this lawsuit, though so many years doubtful in its issue, proved very valuable to Miss Watson; I have heard (but cannot vouch for it) not less valuable than that large part of her property which had been paid over without demur upon her twenty-first birth-day.

At Siboney the detachment stopped to look after the detail from the 13th Infantry, which had not yet reported. The detachment commander sought out the regimental adjutant, who referred him to the regimental commander, Col. Worth.

At one spot along its shore was, and still is, an old country-house, formerly used as a hotel, but whose customers, always pleasure-seekers from the neighboring towns, had been drawn away by the erection of a more modern and satisfactory place of entertainment at the other extremity of the lake, and it had now been for many years closed....", "...fair.

All this time they had nothing to eat; their sole subsistence being a small quantity of rum, which was served out at stated intervals. The following morning, about eight o'clock, land was observed right ahead, and they endeavoured to steer in that direction; but their progress, from the heavy construction of the raft, was necessarily very slow, and it was not until sunset that they found themselves about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten miles from the shore. All the next night they stood in the same direction; and about four or five o'clock in the morning, as near as they could guess, they were cast by the surf upon the beach. Utterly prostrate with the fatigues they had undergone, they threw themselves upon the sand, and soon found in sleep a brief forgetfulness of their past cares and troubles.

A somewhat different account is given by some, in which Bowman is exculpated from all blame.

Most probable is it that this article of accusation does not refer to any imprisonment, real or supposed, at Middleham, in 1469, but to Clarence's invasion of England in 1470, when Edward's state, person, and life were jeopardized by his narrow escape from the fortified house, where he might fairly be called \"in straite warde;\" especially as the words, \"after procuring great commotions,\" could not apply to the date of the supposed detention in Middleham, when,...", "...for all we had was what granny made by odd days' work here and there, and by selling her dried herbs and drinks she made of them.

On our way to the strangers' laboratory we passed a number of trellis-work houses, with creepers trained over their sides and roofs. \"You see,\" said Dr. Treub, with a smile, \"we have _cool_ houses here instead of _hot_ houses. They are for forest plants accustomed to coolness and shelter.\" I was especially asked to notice the...", "...England simply to avoid intermixing any question about foreign trade.

I suppose, because the quantity of silver in that sum is assumed to be the product of four days' labor in a silver-mine. _X_. Certainly; because it is the product of the same quantity of labor as that which produced the hat. Calling twenty shillings, therefore, four ounces of silver, the hat was worth <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> tenths of four ounces. Now, when wages advance from twelve shillings to fourteen shillings, profits (you allege) will not pay this advance, but price. On this supposition the price of the hat will now be--what? _Phil_. Twenty shillings; leaving, as before, six shillings for profit. _X_. Six shillings upon fourteen shillings are not the same _rate_ of profit as six shillings upon twelve shillings; but no matter; it does not affect the argument.

At one time in attack, at another in defence, they circle round each other, and spy out a moment to give a deadly blow.

Thus, for <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> days, the contest went on between the two armies. The army of the Kurus had the advantage; no one ventured to meet the aged Bhishma. Then Krishna, the driver of Arjuna, advised him to mount the chariot of Cikhandin, the young son of Drupada, the prince of the Panchalas, on the following morning and to put on his armour. The aged Bhishma would not fight against Cikhandin; he held it beneath him to fight against children. When he saw Arjuna approach him with the ensigns of...", "...with a grinning mascherino.

He was often in his private cabinet at the Ministry of War at <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock in the morning, and frequently sent home by his private secretary urgent papers which he could examine and initial after dinner, as he had done that day. His wife and daughter were up at the villa near Florence for the vintage, and he was alone and undisturbed.

After the great excitement the weaver had undergone from the events of the afternoon, he had felt a longing for this quietude, and had even begged Mrs. Winthrop and Aaron, who had naturally lingered behind every one else, to leave him alone with his child.

We accordingly hauled up to windward of the island, and had 38 fathoms between it and a small reef lying S. 72 deg. W., between two and three miles from it. The island is low, smooth, and sterile, and is frequented by seals; its latitude is 34 deg. 6' and longitude 120 deg. 28', and it lies eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> miles from the mainland. At noon the rocky island was near ten miles astern, and a cluster of four small islets appeared in the offing at the distance of four leagues. The nearest part of the main land, seven or eight miles distant, was low and sandy, as it had been all the way from East Mount Barren, and continued to be to the furthest extreme visible from the masthead; there were, however, a few scattered sandy hillocks on the shore, but nothing could be seen of the back...", "...eight miles for the physician. Although he himself had been wounded for life by a lion and his friends said that he should not ride at night through a wood infested with beasts, Livingstone insisted on his Christian duty to go, only to find that the man had died and to be obliged to retrace his footsteps. Again and again his party would have been destroyed if it had not been for his own unbounded tact and courage, and after his death at Chitambo's village Susi and Chuma journeyed for <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> months and over eight hundred miles to take his body to the coast. \"We work for a glorious future,\" said he, \"which we are not destined to see--the golden age which has not been, but will yet be.

The description which follows is by Stansbury,[59] and relates to the Sioux: I put on my moccasins, and, displaying my wet shirt like a flag to the wind, we proceeded to the lodges which had attracted our curiosity. There were five of them pitched upon the open prairie, and in them we found the bodies of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> Sioux laid out upon the ground, wrapped in their robes of buffalo-skin, with their saddles, spears, camp-kettles, and all their accoutrements piled up around them. Some lodges contained three, others only one body, all of which were more or less in a state of decomposition. A short distance apart from these was one lodge which, though small, seemed of rather superior pretensions, and was evidently pitched with great care. It contained the body of a young Indian girl...", "...I am sorely stricken.\" And she did as he begged her.

And old Yug Bogdan and his <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> sons fell in the front of the fight: all are dead, lady, and the last that fell was Boshko Jugovich.

I was in full practice as physician, and we congratulated ourselves upon the healthiness of our little isolated camp, when suddenly my wife was prostrated by a severe attack of gastric fever, which for <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> days rendered her recovery almost hopeless.

On Tuesday, the 28th of December, I dined with my old friend, M. Pierlot, and on leaving home I was in the habit of saying where I might be found in case I should be wanted. At <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock at night an express arrived from the Minister of Police desiring me to come immediately to his office. I confess, considering the circumstances of the times, and knowing the Emperor's prejudices against me, such a request coming at such an hour made me feel some uneasiness, and I expected nothing less then a journey to Vincennes. The Duc de Rovigo, by becoming responsible for me, had as yet warded off the blow, and the supervision to which the Emperor had subjected...", "...languages are a compound of all those tongues belonging to the various Asiatic nations through which they passed during their pilgrimage. Firmly as I believe the American Indian to have been descended from the tribes of Israel, and that our continent is full of the most extraordinary vestiges of antiquity, there is one point, a religious as well as an historical point, in which you may possibly continue to doubt, amidst almost convincing evidences. If these are the remnants of the <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> and a half tribes which were carried into Assyria, and if we are to believe in all the promises of the restoration, and the fulfilment of the prophecies, respecting the final advent of the Jewish nation, what is to become of these our red brethren, whom we are driving before us so rapidly, that a century more will find them lingering on the borders of the Pacific Ocean? Possibly the restoration may be near enough to include even a portion of those interesting people.

We were to start at <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock on a certain night. At a quarter to that hour I went to the stable to see that everything was ready, and in the courtyard outside of it found Antonio seated against the water tank groaning and writhing with pains in the back.

The distance from Crockerville is a mile and three-quarters, or a mile in a straight line, and from Takwa, about six. M.

My map will be the first to correct these distances, which are exaggerated by the native carriers to get more pay. The summit of Abo Yao commands an extensive view to the north.

He studied till mid-day; then he took an hour's exercise, and after dinner he sang and played the organ, or listened to others' music. He studied again till six, and from that hour till eight he engaged in conversation with friends who came to see him. Then he supped, smoked a pipe of tobacco, drank a glass of water, and went to bed.

What has become of the bones of all these animals? You see we are not dealing with little creatures, but with animals that make a step of six feet <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> inches; and their remains must have been left somewhere. The probability is, that they been dissolved away, and absolutely lost. I have had occasion to work out the nature of fossil remains, of which there was nothing left except casts of the bones, the solid material of the skeleton having been dissolved out by percolating water. It was a chance, in this case, that the sandstone happened to be of such a constitution as to set, and to allow the bones to be afterward dissolved...", "...and found that there was good anchorage at about half a mile from the shore, quite from the cape to four miles below it; and close by the cape a good harbour, where a ship might refresh with more safety than at Port Famine, and avail herself of a large river of fresh water, with plenty of wood, celery, and berries; though the place affords no fish except mussels.

It is felt to be a mere basis for the display of pictorial art, the theatre for a thousand shapes of dignity and beauty. I have called this imaginary temple hypaethral, because the master left <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> openings in the flattened surface of the central vault.

The next morning between <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> and ten, as Mary sat by Alice's cradle rocking her to sleep, she was sensible of an unusual commotion in and around the house. First there was the sound as of some one dancing in the dark passage. Then there was the same noise in the kitchen below, and a merry voice was heard singing snatches of wild songs, while occasionally peals of laughter were heard mingled with Mrs. Grundy's harsher tones. Mary's curiosity was roused, and as soon as Alice was fairly asleep, she resolved to...", "...offered them, also, three pieces of silver for the animal, and they, pleased to get so much, readily sold it. A little further still he met some shepherds, who were about to hang a little dog. He was sorry for the poor brute, and offered to give them two pieces of silver if they would give the dog to him, and this they very gladly agreed to. So he travelled on homeward, attended by the young bear, the wolf-cub, and the little dog. As all his nine years' savings had amounted only to <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> pieces of silver, he had now but a single piece left. Before he reached his father's house he met some boys who were about to drown a cat.

Still, we had a boy Friday--Sam, an ebony Demeraran, exactly half of whose teeth had been lost in the only automobile ride he had ever taken. Sam was sent by some personal Providence--perhaps the god of intelligence bureaus--as the first of our faithful following in Guiana. Sam had formerly been a warden in the Georgetown jail, and rumor had it that he left because he saw \"jumbies\" in the court where one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> men had been hung. And surely that was where jumbies would be found if anywhere. Even Crusoe's man must have admitted that. How wardenship could be of aid to us in our scientific work was a puzzle.

There are others who prowl around their victim, who guard it in fear lest it should be taken away from them, and who, like the Achilles of Homer, drag their enemy by the feet <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> times round the walls of Troy. The Marquise was like that. She did not see Henri. In the first place, she was too secure of her solitude to be afraid of witnesses; and, secondly, she was too intoxicated with warm blood, too excited with the fray, too exalted, to take notice of the whole of Paris, if Paris had formed a circle round her. A thunderbolt would not have disturbed her. She had not even heard Paquita's last sigh, and believed that the dead girl could still hear her....", "...at the door. How would you like that, children? My father was very particular about such matters, more so than most, perhaps, from having been many years in the army, where, I once overheard an old brother-officer say, he had been considered rather a \"martinet,\" if you know what that means; and my dear mother, who by herself, perhaps, would have been almost too gentle to keep all her family in good order, was firm as a rock where any wish of _his_ was concerned.

He dined, and tried to drown care in claret, but with poor success, Then he issued forth--it was <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock and still light--and walked gently homewards. He walked so slowly that it was half-past nine when he let himself into his chambers in the Albany. His servant was out, and the rooms looked dismal and lonely.

In the reign of one of the Tarquins there appeared before the king a woman who offered him <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> books for sale. The king refused to purchase them, whereupon the woman went away and burned three of the books, and returning offered the remaining books for the same price she had asked for the nine. The king again rejected them; but when the woman, after burning three books more, returned and asked for the three remaining the same price which she had before asked for the nine, his curiosity was excited, and he purchased the books.

I availed myself of this rule, and had the question taken on thirteen, which was rejected. Twelve, eleven, ten and <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> were proposed in succession; the last was adopted by a majority of the members. I voted successively for each of these members, to prevent a less number being agreed on. Had nine not been adopted, I should on the same principle have voted for eight.

The _Union_ had speed enough to slip by the enemy, but the _Huascar_ was too slow. Grau's only chance was to close with the _Cochrane_ before the _Blanco_ could come up astern, and he went straight for the former. At half past <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> the _Huascar_ fired the first shot, the distance being about three thousand yards. It fell short and only the fourth shot took effect. The _Cochrane_ then replied, and though the practice on both sides was wild, the two ships soon came so close that the machine guns were brought into effective play.

The Virgin Mary came from Cana, a little town in Galilee placed in the hills about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> miles from Nazareth, the home of the lowliest and the poorest, of a kindly pastoral people living in the open air, needing and wanting very little, simple in their habits.

In this respect Jupiter resembles the sun, whose surface also has different rates of rotation diminishing from the equator.

The red spot completes a rotation in a little less than <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> hours and fifty-six minutes, but its period can not be positively given for the singular reason that it is variable. The variation amounts to only a few seconds in the course of several years, but it is nevertheless certain. The phenomenon of variable motion is not, however, peculiar to the red spot. Mr. W.F. Denning, who has studied Jupiter for a quarter of a century, says: \"It is well known that in different latitudes of Jupiter there are currents, forming the belts and...", "...and observations at once begun with the koniscope. Within thirty-five seconds of striking the match to light the gas, the products of combustion had extended near the ceiling to the end of the room; this was indicated by the colour in the koniscope suddenly becoming a deep blue.

In half-an-hour the impurity at <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> feet from the floor was very great, the colour being an intensely deep blue. The wide range of the indications of the instrument, from pure clearness to nearly black blue, makes the estimate of the impurity very easily taken with it; and, as there are few parts to get out of order, it is hoped it may come into general use for sanitary work.

This young lady and her sisters were supposed to be haunted by <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> spirits, dispatched by the wicked Mother Samuel for that purpose. The sapient parents heard one part of the dialogue, when the children in their fits returned answers, as was supposed, to the spirits who afflicted them; and when the patients from time to time recovered, they furnished the counterpart by telling what the spirits had said to them. The names of the spirits were Pluck, Hardname, Catch, Blue, and three Smacks, who were cousins.

In March the cholera made its appearance, and in a malignant form. Some cases occurred in camp, and, as I could not get a physician to go out there, I wrote for Dr. Baker, of Austin, an elderly man, to come over and take charge of it. On his arrival I furnished him with a mule, and gave him directions to find the camp. Night came on, and no doctor returned. The next morning about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock he rode up to my office with his umbrella under his arm, his mouth drawn up, the picture of despair. I asked him: \"Are many sick in camp?\" He shook his head in the negative. He was invited to dismount and come into the office, which he did, and told his grievance. It appears that he found camp, attended to the few sick, and started to return to the city. When he reached the Salado, a small stream a few miles from town that was about ten feet wide, his mule declined to...", "...forge also appeared a Latin grammar and a Greek lexicon; and, while with sturdy blows the ambitious youth of sixteen shaped the iron on the anvil, he fixed in his mind conjugations and declensions.

Some vague speculations passed through my mind as to how old the village might be. I had heard some person remark that it had formerly been much more populous, that many of its people had from time to time drifted away to the towns; their old empty cottages pulled down and no new ones built. The road was deep and the cottages on either side stood six to eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> feet above it. Where a cottage stood close to the edge of the road and faced it, the door was reached by a flight of stone or brick steps; at such cottages the landing above the steps was like a balcony, where one could stand and look down upon a passing cart, or the daily long straggling procession of children going to or returning from the village school.

The herdsmen of every village lighted a fire within a square outlined by cutting a trench in the turf. Over the fire was dressed a caudle of eggs, milk, oatmeal, and butter. Part was poured on the ground as a libation. Then every one took a cake of oatmeal, upon which were <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> knobs, each dedicated to some divinity. Facing the fire, they broke off the knobs, one at a time, throwing them over their shoulders and saying: \"This I give to thee. Preserve thou my horses.\" \"This to thee; preserve thou my sheep,\" and so on. The caudle was then eaten.

We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.

I was obliged to exert the utmost care and caution, for in many places the road was not two yards wide, and often the lower side of it sloped away in slanting precipices eight and even <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> feet deep.

During the next <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> years he forsook politics and confined himself to his profession, but in 1826 he ran for Congress, in opposition to Felix Grundy. He had the support of General Jackson, and triumphed by one thousand majority. The canvass was long and exciting, and Mr. Bell was justly proud of his victory.

The trial, which took place in July 1904, excited widespread attention. The prosecution was conducted with all the force of the government; the defence was undertaken by some of the most brilliant Liberal advocates of Germany and developed in effect into an elaborate indictment, supported by a great weight of first-hand evidence, of the iniquities of the Russian regime. The verdict of the court was a serious rebuff for the government; after a preliminary investigation of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> months, and a public trial of a fortnight, the major charges against the prisoners were dismissed, and six of them were condemned only to short terms of imprisonment for conspiracy.

Some of the companies failed to effect an organisation, others offered to sell their rights as soon as obtained.

Correspondence on the Plains On the 4th of May, after the camp had proceeded about two miles on their way, they were met by a Frenchman, Charles Beaumont, a trapper and fur trader, who was traveling eastward over the Oregon road with a camp consisting of three wagons and <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> men. He crossed the river to find out who the pioneers were. During his interview he cheerfully consented to carry letters back to the Saints, so the brethren wrote some fifty or sixty letters and left them in his care. Other means of communication with the later companies on the plains were adopted. Posts were placed at prominent points along the road with writing on them and letters were placed in improvised boxes with a notice on the box. At other times they used whitened...", "...me was a hero whom every one expected to win in throwing the cricket-ball, and next to him a new boy who had astonished every one by calmly putting his name down for the mile race before he had been two hours at Parkhurst. In such company you may fancy our meal was a lively one, and, as most of us were in training, a very careful one. The first race was to be run at twelve, and we thought it a great hardship that the lower school was ordered to attend classes on this of all days from <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> to eleven. Now I am older, it dawns on me that this was a most wholesome regulation; for had we small chaps been allowed to run riot all the morning, we should have been completely done up, and fit for nothing when the races really began. We did not do much work, I am afraid, at our desks that morning, and the masters were not particularly strict, for a wonder. The one thing we had to do was to keep our seats and restrain our ardour, and that was no easy task.

When Liege was captured on the 7th after a brave defense, and its last fort fell on the 15th, there were more fugitives. When Brussels was occupied without resistance on the 20th there were still more. As the invasion spread westward and southward, engulfing city after city in widening waves of blood, the tide of terror and flight rose steadily. It reached its high-water mark when Antwerp, after the Germans had pounded its outer and inner circle of forts for <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> days, was bombarded on October 7 and captured on the 18th. Nothing like that sad, fear-smitten exodus has been seen on earth in modern times. There was something in it at once fateful, trembling, and irresistible, which recalled De Quincey's famous story of The Flight of a Tartar Tribe. No barrier on the Holland border could have kept that flood of Belgian refugees out. They were an enormous flock of sheep and lambs, harried by the Werwolf and fleeing for their lives. But...", "...he must wait for a time before they crossed. But when Geoffrey offered him a reward to put their party on shore at once, he consented to do so, Joe Chambers and the two sailors assisting with the oars; and as the ferry-boat was large and strongly built, they crossed without further inconvenience than the wetting of their jackets. Joe Chambers, who knew the town perfectly, at once took them to a place where they were able to hire a couple of horses, and on these rode to Maldon, some <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> miles away. Here they procured other horses, and it was not long after midday when they arrived at Hedingham.

It was defended by a small fort, mounted with <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> cannon, and manned with one company of the regiment of Bourbon, who surrendered in a very short time after the ships had begun the attack. By this small conquest a considerable expense was saved to the nation in the article of transports employed to carry water for the use of the squadron.

Pett's poem was dedicated to the Lord High Admiral, Howard, Earl of Nottingham; and this may possibly have been the reason of the singular interest which he afterwards took in Phineas Pett, the poet shipwright's son.

I gave that advice under the impression that the Byron controversy was a thing for ever passed, and never likely to return.

The rocks hereabouts are very vividly coloured at certain times of the year, and in the spring are covered with lichens and turf, with blossoms of the blue scilla.

It means old men in the seats of authority, not merely in the church, but in the law-courts and in Parliament, even in the army and navy. For a test I look up the list of bishops of the Church of England in Whitaker's Almanac; it appears that there are 40 of these functionaries, including the archbishops, but not the suffragans; and that the total salary paid to them amounts to more than <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> hundred thousand dollars a year. This, it should be understood, does not include the pay of their assistants, nor the cost of maintaining their religious establishments; it does not include any private incomes which they or their wives may possess, as members of the privileged classes of the Empire.

The knight answered with pride that he would receive him; but, when he was on the point of beginning his course, he perceived on his left hand eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> Saracens, who had halted there to see the event of the tournament. The knight, therefore, instead of directing his course towards the Saracen who had offered to tilt with him, made for this troop, and, striking one of them with his lance, pierced his body through and killed him on the spot. He then retreated to our men, pursued by the other Saracens, one of whom gave him a heavy blow on his helmet with a battle-axe.

The case is well known, and still memorable to mankind. British Parliament, after <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> years of the saddest haggling and baffling to and fro, under Constitutional stress of weather, and such east-winds and west-winds of Parliamentary eloquence as seldom were, has made up its mind, That America shall pay duty on these Teas before infusing them: and America, Boston more especially, is tacitly determined that it will not; and that, to avoid mistakes, these Teas shall never be landed at all.

Between <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> and ten our horses took the way to a _gaard_ standing a little off the road; but it did not appear to be Ole Torgensen's, so we kept on. In the darkness, however, we began to doubt our memory, and finally turned back again. This time there could be no mistake: it was _not_ Ole Torgensen's.

Never was day more welcome. At dawn the wind piped down and the sea moderated. The boat had made a fair amount of water, not only through the leaking patch, but over the gunwale, and, in order to keep the leak under, one of the lascars had to keep his hand down on the canvas stopper while the other plied the baler.

The party consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> young men from Kentucky, fourteen soldiers of the United States army who volunteered their services, two French watermen--an interpreter and hunter--and a black servant belonging to captain Clarke--All these, except the last, were enlisted to serve as privates during the expedition, and three sergeants appointed from amongst them by the captains. In addition to these were engaged a corporal and six soldiers, and nine watermen to accompany the expedition as far as the Mandan...", "...After clearing the channel we crossed a bay about two miles wide and four deep, thickly studded with small islands.

One of them was upon an island eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> miles from the main, between which, however, a chain of smaller ones formed links of communication. These signs of inhabitants gave us hopes of finding some improvement from the almost utter sterility that had hitherto prevailed among these scattered islands.

We soon again moved onwards in a north by east direction, across...", "...Alexander in the end graciously resigns his claim upon her.

Knighton says that sheep and cattle were left to wander about untended, and that they often perished in ditches by the wayside. A murrain occurred the same year; at one place five thousand sheep died in the pasture and were left to putrefy[277]. The price of a horse fell from forty shillings to half a marc; a fat ox could be bought for four shillings, a cow for twelve pence, a heifer for sixpence, a fat sheep for four pence, a stone of wool for <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> pence[278]. On the other hand, when the harvest of 1349 had to be gathered, the price of labour rose enormously. According to Knighton, a reaper got eightpence a day, with his food, and a mower twelvepence. The extant accounts tabulated by Thorold Rogers confirm the contemporary statement: the rates for threshing the harvest of 1349 were those of panic and compulsion, being unparalleled, whether before or after, in the Eastern, Midland and Southern counties; the immediate effect...", "...arrived there from Stavanger, bound for America.

On the other hand, some amateurs may be found who are convinced they are right because they do not quite know what difference exists between the two.

It was the King's habit to go on Saturdays in his coach to Richmond Park, returning to Kensington in the evening; and the scheme, laid bare, was to fall upon him in a narrow lane leading from the river to Turnham Green, where the miry nature of the ground rendered his progress slow. For complicity in this plot <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> persons, differing much in rank, from Sir John Fenwick, who had been Colonel of King Charles's Life Guards, to Keyes, a private in the Blues, suffered on the scaffold; and for a time all England rang with it.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> a.m. the Berkshire Regiment, supported by some marines, advanced upon the Dhilibat Hill, which was held by swarms of the enemy, who were soon driven down the opposite slope.

The material used made the figure perceptible, in a dark colour of mingled black and red.

With one tap she forced out the old primer, inserted a new one, and drove it in.

Now the shell was ready for an ounce and an eighth of number <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> shot, and she measured it and poured it in with practised hand. Then came the last wad, a quick twirl of the crimper, and the first shell lay loaded on the pillow. Before she finished her hands were numb and her little feet like frozen marble.

It is due chiefly to a lack of imagination on the part of the would-be contributor, who appears to be incapable of projecting himself into the editorial viewpoint.

Heedless of such small things, however, Dastral and his brave comrades sailed on, sometimes doing a spiral or a rapid nose-dive, if the enemy appeared to have found the range...", "...I wasn't sure whether I envied him his philosophy; I hadn't time to think it out; I wanted to call on the man and woman who had given us lunch on our first visit. They were leaving Ovcharska and going to Chachak, and I wished to make sure of the legacy of their rooms in case of emergency weather in the winter; also I wanted to buy from them a sheep. I accomplished both missions, the latter at the cost of seventeen dinars. A dinar equals about sevenpence. Our sheep, therefore, cost us <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> shillings and tenpence. It was destined for supper, and our timber friend said it must be roasted whole, according to custom.

Will Henderson, half sitting, half lying on the stretcher-bed, gazed out through the doorway at the distant mountain peaks. His hands were clasped behind his head, and a sullen, preoccupied look was in his eyes. Jim Thorpe was sitting, frog-fashion, on an upturned soap-box, watching him. His eyes were a shade anxious, but full of good feeling. Jim was <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> years his cousin's senior, and Will was twenty-four. They were really almost foster-brothers, for from the younger man's earliest days he had lived with Jim, in the care of the latter's widowed mother. He was an orphan, both his parents having died before he was two years old, and so it was that he had been adopted by Jim's mother, the child's only living relative. For years Jim had lavished on him an elder brother's affection and care. And when his own mother died, and he was...", "...SPECIES. 1 3 2 Eye eccentric. Eye normal. Eye concentric. Eyebrow Firmness.

Patrick Bronte was born at Ahaderg, County Down, in Ireland, on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1777. He was one of the ten children of Hugh Brunty, farmer, and his <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> brothers and sisters seem all of them to have spent their lives in their Irish home, to have married and been given in marriage, and to have gone to their graves in peace.

While writing this account two theories have occurred to me as possibly true respecting this most remarkable assault: First--The aim may have been simply to extort from me such admissions as in the hands of money and influence would have sent me to the Penitentiary for libel. This, however, seems unlikely, because any statements elicited by fear or force could not be evidence in law or could be so explained as to have no...", "...way to Mr. Broza's the following morning.

'This is Leopoldstadt, one of the suburbs,' he explained, calmly; and then I learned that the place with the interminable street we had passed before was Floridsdorf. Would you believe it, there are six such places forming the outer precincts of Vienna, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> regular suburbs--that is fifteen cities enclosing a city!

The enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance without interruption till within <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> miles of the place; and then, when more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front had halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by a heavy fire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy's being near him.

Frederick Byland's 'Chronological Outlines of English Literature' (Macmillan, $1.00) is very useful for reference though now much in need of revision.

CHAPTER I PERIOD I. THE BRITONS AND THE ANGLO-SAXONS. TO A. D. 1066. FOREWORD. The two earliest of the <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> main divisions of English Literature are by far the longest--taken together are longer than all the others combined--but we shall pass rather rapidly over them. This is partly because the amount of thoroughly great literature which they produced is small, and partly because for present-day readers it is in effect a foreign literature, written in early forms of English or in foreign languages, so that to-day it is intelligible only through special study or in translation. THE...", "...there was Jaffa, the Persian interpreter, silent and dignified, always spotlessly clean--a good-looking fellow if he had not had a cataract in one eye. Jaffa was far and away ahead of all the other natives. He gave you the impression that he was the descendant of Persian emperors, brooding over the deserted grandeur and humbled state of his country at the present time. In fact, I treated him with the greatest respect from the very first day. There were three lascar drivers and <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> lascar firemen to look after the boilers and engine, their own lascar \"bundari\" or cook, another cook of some unknown nationality, and his boy, to cook for the rest of the crew. These two were the most depressed, dirty-looking objects I had ever seen. One or the other, generally both, could be seen at any hour of the day--or night, I believe--crouched on the deck, outside the little galley, swishing a dirty cloth round the middle of a saucepan or dish, gazing dejectedly across...", "...of waiting for any answer.

She consoled herself, however, that she was known to be but <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> miles distant from the rectory, and that any commands could be conveyed to her nearly in an hour. What they might be, became now, therefore, her sole anxiety. Would not her Mother write? After an avowal such as she had made of her desolate, if not dying condition, would she not pardon and embrace her? Was it not even possible she might come herself?

The disorder went through all its regular forms. A town was taken, an Eletto was appointed. The country-side was black-mailed or plundered, and the rebellion lasted some thirteen months. Before it was concluded there was another similar outbreak among the Italians, together with the Walloons and other obedient Netherlanders in Hainault, who obliged the city of Mons to collect <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> hundred florins a day for them. The consequence of these military rebellions was to render the Spanish crown almost powerless during the whole year, within the provinces nominally subject to its sway. The cause--as always--was the non-payment of these veterans' wages, year after year. It was impossible for Philip, with all the wealth of the Indies and Mexico pouring through the Danaid sieve of the Holy League in France, to find the necessary funds to save the bronzed and war-worn...", "...Hubert said, as the figures rapidly approached.

By that or any test (for example, the _time_, three P.M.) the Roman coena was dinner.

Between <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> and ten o'clock the same evening Kent was walking the floor of his room, trying vainly to persuade himself that virtue was its own reward, and wondering if a small dose of chloral hydrate would be defensible under the cruel necessity for sleep. He had about decided in favor of the drug when a tap at the door announced the coming of a bell-boy with a note. It was a message from Portia. \"If you have thrown away your chance definitely, and are willing to take a still more desperate...", "...of the station-master, who opened the carriage door, and the dog jumped out. The station-master and the dog were perfect strangers. He and a porter tried to lock up the dog, but he flew viciously at any one who attempted to touch him, although he was not above accepting food. For the next three days his behaviour was decidedly methodical; starting from the station in the morning, he came back dejected and tired at night. At last, on the evening of the third day, he reached home, some <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> miles away, along roads which he had not before travelled, a sorry object and decidedly the worse for wear; after some food he slept for twenty-four hours straight off. Anecdote number two. One day a handsome black, smooth-haired retriever puppy was given to us, whom we named Neptune. The terrier Tan greatly resented having this new companion thrust upon him, and became very jealous of him. Being small, he was unable to tackle so large a dog, but sagacity accomplished what...", "...to the victory we were in time to take part in the pursuit. It was a scene of wild confusion and excitement; the Spaniards galloping off in all directions, singly and in groups, making no attempt to rally, yet when overtaken, fighting to the last, Mejia's men following them with lowered lances and wild cries, managing their fiery little horses with consummate ease, and _making no prisoners_. \"Here is a chance for us; let us charge these fellows!\" shouted Carmen, as eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> of the enemy rode past us in full retreat; and without pausing for a reply he went off at a gallop, followed by Gahra and myself; for although I had no particular desire to attack men who were flying for their lives and to whom I knew no quarter would be given, it was impossible to hold back when my comrades were rushing into danger. Had the Spaniards been less intent on getting away it would have fared ill with us. As it was, we were all wounded. Gahra got a thrust through the...", "...it is probably stationary; in Buenos Ayres, where it is most abundant, many individuals remain all the year in sheltered places, and the migration appears to become more definite the further south we get. Mr. Barrows travelled south across the pampas in the autumn, and says:--\"The species was met with at all points visited, but south of the Azul not a single male in the black plumage was seen, though the brown birds (presumably females or young) were met with almost every day for <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> weeks, and frequently in large numbers. Of course I began to suspect that the males must moult into a brown suit after nesting, as do our Bobolinks and many other birds, but I shot specimens at various times, and all proved to be either females or young males, and as I was confident that at Concepcion black males were to be found through the year, I was at a loss for an explanation, and am so still.\" The male Silver-bill is entirely black, there is nothing in nature blacker...", "...cold, but it has caused his destruction! For these animals were killed by the hundred thousand. Worse than this, they were killed in the most cruel manner. Laws have now been made to help protect the poor fur Seal from its merciless hunters. It lives in cold seas where its deep rich coat is a splendid protection. No finer fur is there for keeping out cold and wet; and the skilful furrier can make it into soft garments of great value. The habits of these Seals are strange indeed. For <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten months of the year they wander freely over the open seas. They dive for their food, and sleep calmly amidst the restless heaving of the ocean. This is the happy life of the Seal, though enemies--Sharks, Killer Whales or Grampuses--sometimes snap him up as he sleeps. Then, in the springtime, there comes a change. The Seals leave the open sea and take to the land. They go to their special breeding-places, or \"rookeries,\" as they are called. The big \"old man\" Seals arrive...", "...city without looking into it. \"You go down the river to Fenchurch Street--in a barge?\" I suggested. \"Bless ye, no, sir!\" said Mr. Smith, getting the smoke of his pipe down his throat the wrong way with laughing, till I thought his coughing-fit would never allow him to give me the important information I required. \"There's boats, sir, plenty on 'em.

It ain't many minutes' walk to Fenchurch Street, and the train takes you straight to the Docks.\" After this we conversed on general seafaring matters.

In the second week of June two things began simultaneously, final examinations and morning baseball practise. Naturally, the first seriously interfered with the second, and it was only by the most complicated arrangement on the part of Hanson that the players were able to report at the nets during the forenoons for batting practise. Three assistant coaches had put in appearance in response to his telegrams, among them the captain of the unsuccessful <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> of the year before. Higgins was a good player and turned out to be as good a coach. His heart was set on witnessing a victory over the Brown and he worked enthusiastically and tirelessly. Afternoon practise began every day at three-thirty, and never let up as long as there was a ray of light left.

As the regular 'Varsity <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> had likewise won the first of their series with Harvard, the \"Sons of Eli\" began to think they had a sure thing, and those who came on from New Haven were dead sure in their minds that they would bring back the scalps of the Harvard freshmen. They said over and over that there would be no need of a third game to settle the matter; Yale would settle it in the second. Walter Gordon had pitched the whole of the first Harvard game. He had been hammered for thirteen singles, two...", "...in her hand, Mrs. Day trailed her rich green satin across the landing, pausing at the door of Bernard, her second-born, coming between Bessie and Deleah.

My mule had a fast walk, which kept the general's horse most of the time in a half-trot. His animal was a fine Kentucky thoroughbred, but for the kind of work at hand I had full confidence in my mount. Whenever Custer was not looking I slyly spurred the mule ahead, and when he would start forward I would rein him in and pat him by way of restraint, bidding him not to be too fractious, as we hadn't yet reached the sandhills. In this way I set a good lively pace--something like <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> miles an hour--all morning. At Smoky Hill River we rested our animals. Then the general, who was impatient to be off, ordered a fresh start. I told him we had still forty miles of sandhills to cross, and advised an easier gait. \"I have no time to waste on the road,\" he said. \"I want to push right ahead.\" Push right ahead we did. I continued quietly spurring my mule and then counseling the brute to take it easy. Presently I noticed that the escort was stringing out far...", "...a good harbor.

It may be stated here that in the report relating to the claim of the Wabash Land Company [Footnote: American State Papers, Land Affairs, Appendix, p. 20.] is a statement giving a list of articles furnished the Indians, among which we notice <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> ear wheels. These we suppose to be the same as the spool shaped ear ornaments found in stone graves and elsewhere. The engraved shells also form a link which not only connects the mound-builders with historic times but corroborates the view advanced in regard to the Shawnees, and indicates also that the Cherokees were mound-builders. But before introducing this we will give the reasons for believing that the mounds of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina are due to the...", "...of pilgrimage, breathing inspiration; and his heart went out, first in discipleship, and then in a pain that was not for himself.

The material used made the figure perceptible, in a dark colour of mingled black and red. I applied the flame of the candle to the circle, and immediately it became lambent with a low steady splendour that rose about an inch from the floor; and gradually front this light there emanated a soft, gray, transparent mist and a faint but exquisite odour.

No fewer than twenty-five such subdivisions have been marked in the trade. Since the so-called tailor is no tailor at all, but a \"button-holer\" or \"baster,\" it is obvious that the working of such a system requires some one capable of general direction. This opinion is not, however, inconsistent with the belief that such work of \"direction\" or...", "...is really sublime.

Italian, then, as were most of the officers of his regiment, which had, in fact, been borrowed by the Emperor from Eugene's army, my colonel was a tall man, at least eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> inches above the standard, and was admirably proportioned--a little stout perhaps, but prodigiously powerful, active, and clean-limbed as a greyhound. His black hair in abundant curls showed up his complexion, as white as a woman's; he had small hands, a shapely foot, a pleasant mouth, and an aquiline nose delicately formed, of which the tip used to become naturally pinched and white whenever he was angry, as happened often.

On this statement, if the landlord should live penuriously, and supply his own family only with necessaries, all his dependents must starve.

The nature of the ground rendered the work of constructing the approaches and batteries extremely difficult, and it was not till 20th June that the first gun opened fire. Wolfe formed a battery on Lighthouse Point, one side of the entrance to the harbour whilst the town was on the other side, with a fortified island in between; and the harbour held a French fleet which, at the time of the arrival of the British, consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> men-of-war. One escaped on the very day of the landing, and was shortly afterwards followed by two more. One L'Echo, was captured by Sir Charles Hardy, and was taken into the British Navy; whilst the other, though chased for some distance, made good its escape to L'Orient with the first news of the siege. Previously to the coming of the British, two ships had been sunk in the harbour's mouth to render entrance therein difficult; two more were added to these, and then a fifth. One...", "...glands, which regulate the temperature and communicate with the surface by ducts, which have a total length of some ten miles.

In the height of this action, an Indian party that had been to war, and taken two prisoners, came in, not knowing of us. Hearing of them, I despatched a party to give them battle in the commons, and got <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> of them, with the two prisoners, who proved to be Frenchmen. Hearing of a convoy of goods from Detroit, I sent a party of sixty men, in armed boats well mounted with swivels, to meet them, before they could receive any intelligence.

What they saw was a youth of about seventeen, with fair hair and blue eyes, the lower part of his face slightly projecting like a monkey's. He was four feet <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> inches in height, broad-shouldered, with tiny hands and delicate little feet, which had never worn shoes nor been put to their natural use, for the soles were as soft as a baby's. He was dressed in grey riding-breeches, a round jacket, which had been made out of a frock-coat by cutting off the skirts, and wore a round felt hat bound with red leather. In his pockets were some rags, some tracts, a rosary, and a paper of gold sand.

IV--THE PASSING OF SAN JUAN HILL When I was a boy I thought battles were fought in waste places selected for the purpose. I argued from the fact that when our school <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> wished to play ball it was forced into the suburbs to search for a vacant lot. I thought opposing armies also marched out of town until they reached some desolate spot where there were no window panes, and where their cannon-balls would hurt no one but themselves. Even later, when I saw battles fought among villages, artillery galloping through a cornfield, garden walls breached for rifle fire, and farm-houses in flames, it always seemed as though the generals had elected to...", "...6th day of April, 1879, these routes were divided and Stephen W. Dorsey took his share because they at that time owed him between sixteen and eighteen thousand dollars. What more did he do, gentlemen? He agreed at that time that he would refund to John W. Dorsey all the money he had expended. That amount was about ten thousand dollars. It was nine thousand and something. He also agreed that he would refund to John M. Peck, who is now dead, the money he had expended, which was between <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> and ten thousand dollars. He also agreed that he would take the routes for the money he had expended, and that was between sixteen and eighteen thousand dollars. So, when those routes were turned over to him they were taken in full of over sixteen thousand dollars advanced by him, ten thousand dollars that he was to give to his brother, and ten thousand dollars that he was to give to John M. Peck--in the neighborhood of thirty-eight thousand dollars in all. Speaking of the sum...", "...in, stumbled and almost fell over an open box. From the box at once proceeded a miserable little wail, broken by as terrible a cough as a child could be afflicted with; and Waymark then perceived that the box was being used as a cradle, in which lay a baby gasping in the agonies of some throat disease, whilst drops from the wet clothing trickled on to its face. On leaving this house, they entered Elm Court. Here, sitting on the doorstep of the first house, was a child of apparently <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten, and seemingly a girl, though the nondescript attire might have concealed either sex, and the face was absolutely sexless in its savagery. Her hair was cut short, and round her neck was a bit of steel chain, fastened with string. On seeing the two approach, she sprang up, and disappeared with a bound into the house. \"That's the most infernal little devil in all London, I do believe,\" said Mr. Woodstock, as they began to ascend the stairs. \"Her mother owes two weeks, and...", "...no answer. I waited three years, placing all my hopes on that answer. At last I resigned myself to my life. To the five hundred francs I received from the Funds I now added twelve hundred from the Mont-de-piete (for they raised my salary), and five hundred which I obtained from Monsieur Cesar Birotteau, perfumer, for keeping his books in the evening. Thus, not only did I manage to get along comfortably, but I laid by eight hundred francs a year. At the beginning of 1814 I invested <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> thousand francs of my savings at forty francs in the Funds, and thus I was sure of sixteen hundred francs a year for my old age. By that time I had fifteen hundred a year from the Mont-de-piete, six hundred for my book-keeping, sixteen hundred from the Funds; in all, three thousand seven hundred francs a year. I took a lodging in the rue de Seine, and lived a little better. My place had brought me into relations with many unfortunates.

CHAPTER SEVEN MOONLIGHT, A MAN AND A SONG Just out from the entrance to a deep, broad-bottomed arroyo where an automobile had been, Starr came upon something that surprised him very much, and it was not at all easy to surprise Starr. Here, in the first glory of a flaming sunset that turned the desert to a sea of unearthly, opal-tinted beauty, he came upon Helen May, trudging painfully along with an old hoe-handle for a staff, and driving <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> reluctant nanny goats that alternately trotted and stood still to stare at the girl with foolish, amber-colored eyes. Starr was trained to long desert distances, but his training had made it second nature to consider a horse the logical means of covering those distances. To find Helen May away out here, eight miles and more from Sunlight Basin, and to find her walking, shocked Starr unspeakably; shocked him out of his shyness and into free speech with her, as though he had...", "...in my new character. I had been told to be ready every afternoon by five o'clock for orders. Yesterday, about six in the afternoon, I received a message from the Globe, directing me to go to a house in East Seventy-fourth Street, near Fifth Avenue, at nine o'clock that evening, and submit myself to the orders of Mr. Q. K. Slater. It was a consoling thought that I had never heard of Mr. Q. K. Slater, and that East Seventy-fourth Street was an unknown region to me. Punctually at <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> that evening I found myself in the large parlor of a house in Seventy-fourth Street, brightly lighted, and filled with people. The centre of the room was cleared, and several people were dancing to the strains of a band. Near the door stood a tall imposing gentleman with gray whiskers, and a lady in full evening dress.

These can be treated briefly for what variations they show from the general type. One of these was a corporation that ran a garage, furnished storage and other care for machines and operated a line of taxicabs, employing from <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> to eleven men. Three of the firm members had been employed chauffeurs and thus got the idea and the money to start the firm. There was storage space for about 50 cars. One of the proprietors came from Georgia, another from North Carolina. They had a book-keeper and the usual books for a business house. Five Negro owners and about forty white owners were storing cars with them. Another enterprise was a corporation of undertakers with a board of eight directors, who held nearly...", "...Colonels Shelby, Sevier, McDowell, Cleveland, and Winston.

It was resolved to pursue the enemy with <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> hundred picked men. Near the Cowpens, where Ferguson had encamped on the fourth, and about thirty miles from King's Mountain, the mountaineers were re-enforced by four hundred and sixty men, the greater part of them from South Carolina, under Colonel Williams.

He meant to use The Plumber as a character in his book--as one of the principal characters. A criminal of the type of The Plumber ought to furnish much material; and without his suspecting it he did furnish much. At the end of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> months they parted.

Here a <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> miles' carry was made to one of the sources of the Wabash, called by the voyageurs \"la petite riviere.\" This stream was so low that the boats could not have gone down it had it not been for a beaver dam four miles below the landing-place, which backed up the current. An opening was made in the dam to let the boats pass. The traders and Indians thoroughly appreciated the help given them at this difficult part of the course by the engineering skill of the beavers--for Hamilton was...", "...6. _Stichocorys rathkei_, n. sp.

He is an only son.\" Whereupon Paterfamilias went off to his study and his sermon; and his son, like the Princess in Andersen's story of the swineherd, was left outside to sing,-- _\"O dearest Augustine, All's clean gone away!\"_ Not that he did say that--that was the princess's song--what he said was,-- \"_I wish I were an only son!_\" This was rather a vain wish, for round the dining-room fire (where he soon joined them) were gathered his <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> brothers and sisters, who, to say the truth, were not looking much more lively and cheerful than he. And yet (of all days in the year on which to be doleful and dissatisfied!) this was Christmas Eve. Now I know that the idea of dulness or discomfort at Christmas is a very improper one, particularly in a story. We all know how every little boy in a story-book spends the Christmas holidays. First, there is the large hamper of good things sent by grandpapa, which is as...", "...they had made a truce with them so that they, namely, the Maquas, wished to trade for their skins, because the Maquas Indians wanted to receive just as much for their skins as the French Indians did. So I proposed to Mr. Marten Gerritsen to go and see if it was true, so soon to run counter to their High Mightinesses; and, besides, trade was doing very badly, therefore I went as above with Jero[ni]-mus [de] la Croex and Willem Tomassen. May the Lord bless my voyage! We went between <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> and ten o'clock with five Macquas Indians, mostly northwest above eight leagues, and arrived at half-past twelve in the evening at a hunter's cabin, where we slept for the night, near the stream that runs into their land and is named Oyoge. The Indians here gave us venison to eat. The land is mostly full of fir trees, and the flat land is abundant. The stream runs through their land near their (Maquas) castle, but we could not ascend it on account of the heavy freshet....", "...may depend that San Martin has some scheme in his head.\" But the rest of us were doubtful. \"If I had an enemy in a trap, my scheme would be to keep him there and not to let him walk out through an open door,\" laughed a young captain. \"The war might have been finished to-day; now it's likely to go on for another twelvemonth.\" \"Well,\" remarked one of his comrades, \"it's a comfort to think we shan't kill ourselves through over-exertion.\" By degrees we pushed on to a place about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> leagues east of Lima, where it seemed as if the lumbering machine had broken down altogether. It was evening when we arrived and halted; the men ate the last morsel of their scanty rations; the chief officers, though no one could imagine what they found to discuss, held a conference, and presently it leaked out that the pursuit had been abandoned. \"I don't profess to understand it,\" exclaimed Major Gamarra, \"but you will find that there's some grand scheme in the air.\" \"Ah!\"...", "...that they must escape. They were all three well mounted, and are now, no doubt, some distance from Jerusalem. Such are the facts. Such is the story as learned of the Messiah of the Jews. Were their prophets right? Has the great Prince come? Is the glory of Rome to pass away before the glory of the Hebrew Christ? Will the Tetrarch remain undisturbed? THE BABY AND THE BEAR This is a true story of the woods: It was afternoon on the day before a holiday, and a boy of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> and a fat-legged baby of three years were frolicking in front of a rough log house beside a stream in a forest of northern Michigan. The house was miles from the nearest settlement, yet the boy and baby were the only ones about the place. The explanation of this circumstance was simple. It was proposed to build a sawmill in the forest, and ship the lumber downstream to the great lake. The river was deep enough to allow the passage up to the sawmill site of a small barge, and a...", "...what can be done, and will not lose sight of you,\" observed the captain, walking away. There were grumblers and discontented men, as there are on board most ships. Dick Bracewell was among them. He soon got tired of the strict discipline, grumbled at being compelled to turn out neatly-dressed and clean, and at being only allowed to smoke his pipe at certain times and in one part of the ship, and more than all at having his grog stopped, or being compelled to drink it mixed with <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> parts of water when he had neglected his duties or broken through any regulations, as was not unfrequently the case. Having had a good deal of money in his pocket when pressed, he was able to buy from others their allowance of grog.

Ralph was doing his best to get him to sit...", "...iron; which metal, if I was not much mistaken, they called by the name of _goone_; though, like their neighbours in Prince William's Sound, they seemed to have many significations to one word. They evidently spoke the same language; as the words _keeta_, _naema_, _oonaka_, and a few others of the most common we heard in that Sound, were also frequently used by this new tribe. After spending about two hours between the one ship and the other, they all retired to the western shore. At <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock, we came to an anchor, in sixteen fathoms water, about two leagues from the west shore, and found the ebb already begun. At its greatest strength, it ran only three knots in the hour, and fell, upon a perpendicular, after we had anchored, twenty-one feet. The weather was misty, with drizzling rain, and clear, by turns. At the clear intervals, we saw an opening between the mountains on the eastern shore, bearing east from the station of the ships, with low land, which we...", "...von Bezold, _Zeitschrift fur Kirchengeschichte_ xx. 186 sqq.; Barge, _Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt_, i. 432 sqq.

Their distinctive name is the _Evangelical_, as opposed to the _Reformed_ church. Their dogmatic symbols are usually said to include <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> separate creeds which together form the _Book of Concord_ (_Liber Concordiae_). Three belong to the Early Christian church--the _Apostles' Creed_, the _Nicene Creed_ (in its Western form, i.e. with the _filioque_), and the so-called _Athanasian Creed_; six come from the 16th century--the _Augsburg Confession_, the _Apology for the Augsburg Confession_, the _Schmalkald Articles_, Luther's two _Catechisms_, and the _Form of Concord_.

At the same time, however, Psyche was inwardly aware of a great, yet indescribable, change from that Mortimer who had bidden her farewell <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> years before. The principle, the genius of the man remained; but it existed now within the sphere of such a mighty and grand personality as transcended all she had previously known or conceived. It was as if some beneficent angel had stooped from heaven to visit them, and, lest his celestial splendour should overwhelm them, had assumed the guise and tone of that human being in whom they felt the most affectionate trust. Through his manner and aspect, and the low resounding melody...", "...pence would be enough to prevent me from starving by the way. Therefore, though I was not a little vexed and humiliated that the soldiers would not accept my treat, I was glad when I considered that the expenditure of my money would have reduced me to beggary, and I soon after retired to my bed of \"long feathers\" as the Irishman designated it. So long as the soldiers were up and moving about the room I never thought of home, but after the last trumpet had sounded, a little after <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock, and the men were all in their beds, I began to think of my mother, brothers, and sisters, one of the latter being particularly attached to me, and I wished in my heart that I had returned to W--with Harry and Ned.

But in the passage she paused; an unwonted, or rather untimely, sound reached her ears, a sound which came from the front of the house--and at <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock in the morning! Had Austen been at home, Euphrasia would have thought nothing of it. In her remembrance Hilary Vane, whether he returned from a journey or not, had never been inside the house at that hour on a week-day; and, unlike the gentleman in \"La Vie de Boheme,\" Euphrasia did not have to be reminded of the Sabbath.

At the report of our gun--the Confederate States flag being at our peak--the little craft, which had probably been in an agony of apprehension, for some hours past, saw that her fate was sealed, and without further ado, put her helm down, lowered her foresail, hauled down her flying-jib, drew her jib-sheet over to windward--and was hove to; the stars and stripes streaming...", "...a very heavy fire, which we returned as warm as possible.

The action was very smart for about two hours; we began firing at <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock in the morning, and did not leave off till half after twelve.

A remarkable feature of AEtna is the large number of minor cones which are scattered over its sides. They look small in comparison with the great mass of the mountain, but in reality some of them are of large dimensions. The best period for making the ascent of AEtna is between June and September, after the melting of the winter snows, and before the falling of the autumnal rains. In winter there are frequently <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten miles of snow stretching from the summit downward, the paths are obliterated, and the guides sometimes refuse to accompany travelers. Moreover, violent storms often rage in the upper regions of the mountain, and the wind acquires a force which it is difficult to withstand, and is at the same time piercingly cold. A list of the eruptions of AEtna from the earliest times has been given by several writers. The first eruption within the historical period probably happened in...", "...that corner of the barn just above where Davie's rabbits are. You know, Pennie.

Its president is as near a super-man as I shall ever hope to know, but nine hundred miles is nine hundred miles, and the line that runs so near to X. is but a minor branch of a vast system that seemingly at least has hundreds that are more important.

The road, which is of gravel, and regularly used, is hard and level, and the stream turns it into a bed, perhaps eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> feet across. The natural course would seem to be to dig the stream a bed of its own by the side of the road; but local ingenuity has preferred to send the traveller dryshod over a stile through the field at the side of the stream, which duly proceeds in the Ordnance map down the road it has chosen.

It consists of a single block of snowy marble, <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> feet long, and four feet high, on which the consular general is represented in a spirited bas-relief mounted on horseback and saving the life of a man from the lion, in whose flank Jovinus has launched his spear.

The platform is only about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> feet from north to south, and five from east to west, so that it would not require a large mass. My opinion was confirmed by observing that two piers are built on the north and south of the platform, and that on the east there is a wall separating the Golgotha from some of the rooms of the Greek convent, and on the west the inlaid pavement of the chapel.

The trap complete with chain and \"drag\" weighs about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> pounds. [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 50 TRAP] Spread of Jaws, 9 inches.

Thus ended this awful conflict, in which out of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> men, two only escaped unhurt. Tucker and Kilpatrick were killed on the spot, Stoner was mortally wounded, and died on his arrival at Limestone, and all the rest, excepting Ray and Plascut were severely wounded.

He summoned the old black servant, who had been bred up in his father's house, and was a middle-aged man while Roderick lay in his cradle. \"Scipio!\" he began; and then paused, with his arms folded over his heart. \"What do people say of me, Scipio.\" \"Sir! my poor master!...", "...of jiu-jitsu was beyond the average.

He withdrew himself from public observation for a time, but his active mind would not let him remain long in obscurity. In a few months, he was again in business, though in a small way. His efforts were more cautiously directed than before, and proved successful. He made something above his expenses during the first year, and after that accumulated money rapidly. In five or six years, Mr. Jenkins was worth some <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten thousand dollars.

That is to say, if you could measure off all the ground over which the rain fell, and spread the whole nine months' rain over it, it would make a lake 500 inches, or more than 40 feet deep!

The greater part of the area burned over consisted of mountain-slopes and ridges that lay between the altitudes of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> thousand and eleven thousand feet. The forest was made up almost entirely of Engelmann and Douglas spruces, alpine fir, and flexilis pine. A majority of these trees were from fifteen to twenty-four inches in diameter, and those examined were two hundred and fourteen years of age. Over the greater extent of the burn the trees were tall and crowded, about two thousand to the acre. As the fire swept over about eighteen thousand acres, the number of trees that perished must have...", "...endeavouring to cultivate their reasoning faculties, a process by which children are apt to be converted from natural logicians into impertinent sophists.

During my visit to the Southwest, in the summer of 1885, it was my good fortune to arrive at the Navajo Reservation a few days before the commencement of a Navajo healing ceremonial. Learning of the preparation for this, I decided to remain and observe the ceremony, which was to continue <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> days and nights. The occasion drew to the place some 1,200 Navajos. The scene of the assemblage was an extensive plateau near the margin of Keam's Canyon, Arizona. A variety of singular and interesting occurrences attended this great event--mythologic rites, gambling, horse and foot racing, general merriment, and curing the sick, the latter being the prime cause of the gathering. A man of distinction in the tribe was threatened with loss of vision from inflammation of the eyes,...", "...alive to any sight or sound, and was excited by the earnest whispering of my fellow adventurers, and the careful directions as to our progress given by the guides and light-bearers. With eager rapidity we flitted among the black shadows of the cavern, till we reached a winding flight of giant steps.

Presently, through the darkness, we perceived at an apparently interminable distance a few dots of light, that shed no lustre, and could help us in no way to pierce the pitchy gloom of the great cavern. The lights were not interminably distant, for they were upon the other shore, and this gnome lake is but a mere drop of water in the mountain mass, its length being three hundred and...", "...a young French trader married to a squaw at Green Bay, and strong in influence with the tribes of that region, came down the lakes from Michillimackinac with a fleet of canoes manned by two hundred and fifty Ottawa and Ojibwa warriors; stopped a while at Detroit; then embarked again, paddled up the Maumee to Raymond's fort at the portage, and led his greased and painted rabble through the forest to attack the Demoiselle and his English friends. They approached Pickawillany at about <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> o'clock on the morning of the twenty-first. The scared squaws fled from the cornfields into the town, where the wigwams of the Indians clustered about the fortified warehouse of the traders. Of these there were at the time only eight in the place. Most of the Indians also were gone on their summer hunt, though the Demoiselle remained with a band of his tribesmen.

Thus one child thought of God as a very small person who could easily pass through the keyhole. The opposite idea of God's huge framework, illustrated above, is probably but another attempt to figure the conception of omnipresence. Curious conclusions too are sometimes drawn from the supposition.

The Court desired that they should be secured from interference by settlers in the enjoyment of their mands, and of their spots appropriated to religious rites. Accordingly pattas were issued, granting to each mand three bullahs (11.46 acres) of land.

Baby-talk may be \"cute\" at eighteen months, but when children retain that mode of expression beyond the age of four or five it sounds silly. At about the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">nine</span> or ten months the breast-fed babe should be weaned. Gradual weaning is perhaps the best.
