The average width of the Appian Way was from eighteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet, so as to admit of two carriages passing each other, and the expense of constructing the first section of it was so great that it exhausted the public treasury of Rome.

Only once, towards the end of June at Kenesaw Mountain, some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles north of Atlanta, did he attack Johnston's entrenchments, causing himself some unnecessary loss and failing in his direct attack on them, but probably thinking it necessary to show that he would attack whenever needed.

Now when Abner heard what the messengers said, [for they overtook him in a certain place called Besira, which was distant from Hebron <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> furlongs,] he suspected none of the mischief which was befalling him, and came back. Hereupon Joab met him in the gate, and received him in the kindest manner, as if he were Abner's most benevolent acquaintance and friend; for such as undertake the vilest actions, in order to prevent the suspicion of any private mischief intended, do frequently make the greatest pretenses to what really good men sincerely do.

She was a woman at the age of eleven, and made up to any one she met; but no one dared so much as look at her, for they were afraid of the farmer's gun.

Kongstrup, the present master of Stone Farm, had come to the island about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years before, and even now no one could quite make him out. When he first came he used to wander about on the heath and do nothing, just as she did; so it was hardly to be wondered at that he got into trouble and had to marry her. But it was dreadful! He was a queer fellow; but perhaps that was what people were like where he came from? He first had one idea and then another, raised wages when no one had asked him to, and started stone-quarrying with contract work. And so he...", "...of both, as well as the rest of Europe.

In a corner of the hall, beside the window looking over the Common, was an armchair in which Vio often sat when taking her breakfast up-stairs and glancing over her correspondence. I sank into it now, and waited. Sooner or later Lydia must come out again. This she did, some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes later, dainty and nonchalant. \"Lydia,\" I cried, springing to my feet, \"what in the name of Heaven are you doing here?\" \"You see.\" The parcel she had taken from Boosey was now undone, revealing some three or four pairs of corsets.

Only about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> men were left to the young King. It was no longer season to tarry; they set off, a great band of the enemy's troops in full pursuit.

The ideas of rapidity and continuity may be conveniently summed up in the hackneyed and often misapplied term, unity of action.

So, dear brethren! what with interruptions, what with growing by fits and starts, and long, dreary winters like the Arctic winters, coming in between the two or three days of rapid, and therefore brief and unwholesome, development, we must all, I think, take to heart the condemnation suggested by this text when we compare the reality of our lives with the divine intention concerning them.

In 1881 M. Jooris gives it as 45,000,000 hectolitres (one hectolitre = 2.75 bushels). Taking M.

Of the four collapsible boats--although collapsible is not really the correct term, for only a small portion collapses, the canvas edge; \"surf boats\" is really their name--one was launched at the last moment by being pushed over as the sea rose to the edge of the deck, and was never righted. This is the one <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> men climbed on. Another was caught up by Mr. Lowe and the passengers transferred, with the exception of three men who had perished from the effects of immersion. The boat was allowed to drift away and was found more than a month later by the Celtic in just the same condition. It is interesting to note how long this boat had remained afloat after she was supposed to be no longer seaworthy.

The mob were attacked and routed, and two or three persons were killed, besides about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> being taken prisoners; and it was only the exhibition of the determination of the military and constabulary forces to enforce the law which at length thoroughly and completely dispersed them.

When all these preparations were complete Mrs. Tregennis realized that winter was indeed upon them.

The twenty boys and girls who were Miss Lavinia's pupils had learned to respect the whiteness of this step, and on muddy days they jumped over it so that no footprint should mar its cleanliness. More than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> children Miss Lavinia could not take. The back sitting-room was used as the schoolroom. There were tables and chairs for the children with the longest legs, while the very little ones sat on the two low window-seats. Tommy loved going to school, and he was never late.

On his way he almost always called for Ruthie, who was now only his cousin, but who in the future was...", "...elephants so tame as those near the Chiponga: they stood close to our path without being the least afraid. This is different from their conduct where they have been accustomed to guns, for there they take alarm at the distance of a mile, and begin to run if a shot is fired even at a longer distance. My men killed another here, and rewarded the villagers of the Chiponga for their liberality in meal by loading them with flesh.

It had been built up recently, so to speak, and had, therefore, broad, spacious streets, unusually so, he thought, as he now found himself in the heart of the business district. Perhaps they may have seemed wider, because he had become accustomed to the narrow highways of Attalia. In addition to the wide streets, the sidewalks stretched back from the buildings they fronted, from twelve to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet, giving pedestrians plenty of room to walk unconcernedly along. As they continued on their way, he further observed that the business section covered an unusually large area, and it was hard to tell which might be called the main street. As the street cars clanged by him, he noticed another feature, also. The position occupied by the Negro passengers. They entered and left the car from the front instead of from the rear, as was the custom in Attalia. \"Negroes do lots of...", "...So let him come down without the slightest fear, and if you dread any outbreak on my part, stay here with us.

In this frail bark they boldly ventured to sea; and, notwithstanding a strong south breeze, happily found the _Orelia_ at Partridge Island, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles distant. Contrary winds had compelled that vessel to put back to the island, and boats were instantly forwarded to the relief of the sufferers, who for two days had been without sustenance.

The circumstances attending the capture were subject to the investigation of a court martial.

General Sickles was undoubtedly clever; he had experience in his time as a journalist, an advocate, and a soldier. It was his opinion that Spain had found in the Republic the means of establishing her power and prosperity on a solid basis. During the crisis, he kept his Government informed of what was passing, and to his demand transmitted by cable in the dawn of Wednesday, the 14th of February, an answer was returned within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> hours, permitting him to exercise his judgment as he thought proper. He imagined that a Federal Republic, on the pattern of that of the United States, with provincial legislatures in Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and so on, and a National Congress in Madrid, was the panacea for the ills of Spain, and that that would be sufficient to dissolve all antagonisms of race, custom, and feeling, and amalgamate them into one accordant patriotic sentiment.

The whole system was immeasurably superior to the German, and at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> times as accurate, for the British system was absolutely automatic. It recorded the arrival of the sound at the various microphones instantaneously on a permanent record; while the German system, apart from its crude method of measuring time, was subject to the combined errors of four human 'microphones.'

He came back to write his \"Physical Geography of the Sea and Its Meteorology.\" This, the essence of his life work, the poetry and the romance of his science, passed through <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> editions and was known in every school, but the book's greatest interest was killed by the removal of the poetic strain that made it beautiful. It has been translated into almost every language. In it is the story of the sea, its tides and winds, its shore lines and its myriads of life; its deep and barren bottoms.

They had neither wagons nor provisions with them, and had nothing to eat but some ears of corn and green apples plucked on the road.

The second force put in the field by China is estimated by the Jesuits and the Japanese at 200,000 men and at 51,000 by Korean history. Probably the truth lies midway between the two extremes. This powerful army moved across Manchuria in the dead of winter and hurled itself against Pyong-yang during the first week of February, 1593. The Japanese garrison at that place cannot have greatly exceeded <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand men, for nearly one-half of its original number had been detached to hold a line of forts guarding the communications with Seoul. Neither Chinese nor Japanese history comments on the instructive fact that the arrival of this army under the walls of Pyong-yang was China's answer to her envoy's promise of a satisfactory peace, nor does it appear that any discredit attached to Chen Weiching for the deception he had practised; his competence as a negotiator was subsequently...", "...which are quite unnecessary.\" \"I might even spare you,\" she remarked, smiling, \"Lady Anne for your secretary.\" \"Even that inducement,\" he answered steadily, \"does not move me.\" She sighed. \"You will have your own way,\" she said, \"and yet there is something rather sad about it.

This morning we were all startled by a cry of 'SAIL HO!' Sure enough, we could see it! And for a time we cut adrift from the second mate's boat, and steered so as to attract its attention. This was about half-past five A.M. After sailing in a state of high excitement for almost <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes we made it out to be the chief mate's boat. Of course we were glad to see them and have them report all well; but still it was a bitter disappointment to us all.

The Choaspes (Kerkha) rises on the southern slope of the Elvend, on the northern slope of which lay Ecbatana.

In its upper course the Choaspes traverses an elevated depression, which is now thickly strewn with villages, the chosen summer abode of the shepherd tribes. To the north this depression is bounded by a steep mountain-chain, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles in length, which ends towards the east in a precipitous wall of rock more than 1500 feet high. On this wall, which looks towards the rising sun, over a clear fountain which springs at the foot of the rock, Darius caused a part of the stone 300 feet above the plain to be made smooth with the chisel, polished and cut in relief; the relief is explained by two inscriptions, a shorter one above and a longer one below, in cuneiform letters.

Before engaging in a _defile_ it should be thoroughly examined, and sufficient detachments sent out to cover the main body from attack while effecting the passage. A neglect of these precautions has sometimes led to the most terrible disasters. In military operations very much depends upon the rapidity of marches. The Roman infantry, in Scipio's campaigns in Africa, frequently marched a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles in five hours, each soldier carrying from fifty to eighty pounds of baggage. Septimius Severus, Gibbon states, marched from Vienna to Rome, a distance of eight hundred miles, in forty days.

It happened, also, that our candidate (I am a Republican, and so is Mr. Strongitharm) was rather favorably inclined to the woman's cause. It happened, thirdly--and this is the seemingly insignificant pivot upon which we whirled into triumph--that he, Mr. Wrangle, and the opposing candidate, Mr. Tumbrill, had arranged to hold a joint meeting at Burroak. This meeting took place on a magnificent day, just after the oats-harvest; and everybody, for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles around, was there. Mrs. Whiston, together with Sarah Pincher, Olympia Knapp, and several other prominent advocates of our cause, met at my house in the morning; and we all agreed that it was time to strike a blow.

And thrice happy is the man who can boast an income of ten, fifteen, or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> rupees a month, though the poorest and least skilled laborers in England would reckon themselves badly paid on as much per week.

One such man admitted that he had usually smoked from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> to thirty cigars a day. He consented to give up smoking altogether, and his sight was fully restored in three and a half months.

He had the bow chain veered out and the tugs all set to work, assisted by the tide, to haul the ship up the river. In about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes time, the paddlewheel was got clear of the cradle, and this great difficulty was overcome. Fortunately, the tide was an extraordinarily high one, and the time of available high water was long. * * * * * The ship had not been moved far towards her berth when another mishap delayed her progress. The barge of the bow purchase came foul of the starboard paddlewheel, and the only way of freeing the ship was to scuttle the barge.

Strive as they would, however, and did, the Britons gradually gave way. Thus, and thus only, can we fill the dreary void in British history, which we know as the first hundred and fifty years of the Making of England. This brings us very near to the end of our period. Not of our subject; for in my concluding lecture I have to deal--with sad scantness--with the Christian Church in other parts of these islands, before and at the coming of Augustine. In the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years immediately preceding the arrival of Augustine, the long line of British Bishops of London came to an end. It has been a subject of remark, and of moralising, that Theonus, the last bishop, lost heart and fled just when the chance was coming for which it is presumed that he had been waiting, the actual beginning of the conversion of the English. But remarks of this character are misplaced; they disregard--or are ignorant of--the political facts of the time. Theonus of...", "...we find the Japanese celebrated, or notorious, throughout the whole of the Far East for exploits abroad; we find them known as the 'kings of the sea'; we find them welcoming foreigners with cordiality and opposing no obstacles to foreign commerce or even to the propagandism of foreign creeds; we find them so quick to recognize the benefits of foreign trade and so apt to pursue them that, in the space of a few years, they establish commercial relations with no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> over-sea markets; we find them authorizing the Portuguese, the Dutch and the English to trade at every port in the empire; we find, in short, all the elements requisite for a career of commercial enterprise, ocean-going adventure and industrial liberality.

For this reason, a large, dry well is dug down to the level of the water-table and the pump is solidly bolted to a concrete foundation built on the bottom of this well. A supply pipe may be extended any depth below the pump, but the standing water surface in the well should reach within a few feet of the pump. The pump and supply must be so well balanced against each other that the pull-down from pumping will not lower the water-level in the well more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet below the pump. The nearer the ground water is to the pump the better. The water well below the pump may be bored, or a perforated well pipe may be driven; or several well points may be connected. The kind of well must depend upon the condition of the earth and the nature of the water supply. Driven wells are more successful when water is found in a stratum of coarse gravel.

The meteors were both larger and more numerous than in 1872. Their numbers in the densest part of the drift were estimated by Professor Newton at 75,000 per hour, visible from one spot to so large a group of spectators that practically none could be missed.

The rapid rise of our western rivers is very different from the gradual swelling of the Nile, which begins at Khartoum, at the junction of the White and Blue Niles, as early as April each year, but which is not felt at Cairo until after the summer solstice, while the greatest height is not reached till autumn. A good flood gives a rise of forty feet at the first cataract, and about twenty-five at Cairo; a scanty rise is when only between eighteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet occurs at Cairo. The inundation is good if it is between twenty-four and twenty-seven feet; if beyond the latter it becomes a destructive flood. Upon such a narrow margin--the rise of a few feet more or less in the Nile--depends the entire crop of Egypt! Once for a period of seven years (A.D. 457-464), the rise failed and seven years of famine ensued.

A little knot of some twenty men were collected together on the pavement, engaged in serious religious discussion. At the same time there was a kind of concert going on in the buildings of the Court Club in the same street, and a police officer noticing the little group collected near the church sent a mounted policeman to disperse it. It was absolutely unnecessary for the officer to disperse it. A group of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> men was no obstruction to anyone, but he had been standing there the whole morning, and he wanted to do something. The policeman, a young fellow, with a resolute flourish of his right arm and a clink of his saber, came up to us and commanded us severely: \"Move on! what's this meeting about?\" Everyone looked at the policeman, and one of the speakers, a quiet man in a peasant's dress, answered with a calm and gracious air, \"We are speaking of serious matters, and there is no need...", "...he never had to work for a living, and that by the time he was thirty life had become a bore and a weariness to him. He had no interests left; they had paled and perished, one by one, and left him desolate. He had begun to think of suicide.

It elaborated itself on his hands;--it became <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> times more complex and formidable than was his first rude draft of it. Every new addition to his original plan which cropped up in his mind gave him a fresh interest and a new pleasure. He designed the Club badge himself, and worked over it, altering and improving it, a number of days and nights; then sent to London and had it made. It was the only one that was made. It was made for me; the \"rest of the Club\" went without. He invented the thirty-two members and their...", "...in the possession of De Beauvallon since the eve of the encounter. Circumstantial evidence went to show that he was familiar with the weapons, and had practised with them on the fatal morning. But the testimony of the witnesses, the facts themselves, the skilful pleading of Duval, prevailed not against the eloquence of Berryer. His magical powers of oratory brought the jury round to his point of view, and De Beauvallon was acquitted of the charge of murder, though cast in damages of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand francs towards the mother and the sister of his victim. The affair did not end there. The friends of Dujarier refused to be diverted from the trail of vengeance. Fresh and conclusive evidence came to light, and De Beauvallon and D'Ecquevillez were placed on their trial for perjury during the first hearing. As regarded D'Ecquevillez, it was established that he was no viscount, but a _bourgeois_ of doubtful antecedents named Vincent, that his rank in the Spanish service...", "...covered on the outside with earth thrown up at night. The enemy and ourselves used the same form of rifle-trench, varied according to the nature of the ground, viz.: the trees and bushes were cut away for a hundred yards or more in front, serving as an abatis or entanglement; the parapets varied from four to six feet high, the dirt taken from a ditch outside and from a covered way inside, and this parapet was surmounted by a \"head-log,\" composed of the trunk of a tree from twelve to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> inches at the butt, lying along the interior crest of the parapet and resting in notches cut in other trunks which extended back, forming an inclined plane, in case the head-log should be knocked inward by a cannon-shot.

Our camp had indeed been pitched by the all-guiding Hand in a goodly place. The men declared on retiring that they felt the healing _cochlearia_ in their very bones, and it is certain that we all felt the glow of our changed condition throughout our whole being. The next day two of us climbed the highest land of the island for a glance at our situation. We found it as depressing as our paradise of greenness had been encouraging. We could see southward the closed ice-pack for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles, and faint indications of the same condition of the sea could be discerned for twenty more miles.

In order to neutralise it, Marzio had tried the experiment of braving what he considered to be a momentary terror by obstinately studying the details of the plan he intended to execute.

For want of pakehas to trade with, and from whom to procure gunpowder and muskets, many tribes or sections of tribes were about this time exterminated, or nearly so, by their more fortunate neighbours who got pakehas before them, and who consequently became armed with muskets first. A pakeha trader was therefore of a value say about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> times his own weight in muskets.

They walked <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles at least; they drank all day long--port, Lisbon, chocolate, negus, tea, coffee, and cherry-brandy, besides their beer at dinner. On nine different occasions they called for a pint or a bottle. A truly wonderful and improving Sunday!

In 1875 he attended the University at Koenigsberg, and in 1877 migrated to the University of Berlin. His first impulse was to become a teacher, and he spent several years in a wide range of studies in philosophy and literature. Then he turned to journalism, and edited a political weekly. He finally forsook journalism for literature, and for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years he has been known in every part of the intellectual world. Like Mr. J. M. Barrie, Signor D'Annunzio, and other contemporaries, Sudermann has achieved high distinction both as a novelist and as a dramatist. Indeed, one of the signs of the times is the recruiting of playwrights from the ranks of trained experts in prose fiction. It may perhaps be regarded as one more evidence of the approaching supremacy of the Drama, which many literary prophets have foretold.

The high officials do not at any rate allow business to exclude the finer graces of life, for in the great hall in which I waited for the cicerone were long tables on which were some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty baskets containing visiting cards, and open books containing signatures, and before each basket was a card bearing the name of an important functionary of the Hotel de Ville--such as the Prefet de la Seine, and the Sous-Prefet, and their principal secretaries, and so forth.

He was fairly overpowered by Ben's audacity. \"A-hundred-and-fifty-dollars!\" he ejaculated, turning his wrinkled face toward our hero. \"That's about the figure,\" said Ben cheerfully. \"A hundred and fifty dollars and board, or three hundred dollars, and I'll board with my...", "...than in rural districts, \"and during the first five years of life the town death-rate is almost exactly double that of the rural districts.\" As these returns include both the rich and the poor, no doubt more than double the number of births would be requisite to keep up the number of the very poor inhabitants in the towns, relatively to those in the country. With women, marriage at too early an age is highly injurious; for it has been found in France that, \"twice as many wives under <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> die in the year, as died out of the same number of the unmarried.\" The mortality, also, of husbands under twenty is \"excessively high,\"[241] but what the cause of this may be seems doubtful.

Boats began to ply between the ships, and the officers of the Trinity, Santiago, Victoria, and Concepcion assembled under the awning of the San Antonio, Mesquita's ship, of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> tons. Mesquita, as we have said, was a cousin of Magellan, and so the Antonio seemed a friendly ship. Magellan sat down by his cousin.

The forces landed below Grand Gulf, including the 17th Corps, numbered about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand. The Confederates forces at Vicksburg, Haines Bluff, Jackson, Port Gibson and Grand Gulf, aggregated about sixty thousand. We were in an enemy's country, practically cut off from retreat as well as from our base of supplies.

Suddenly he began to move; then he sprang, moving in a semicircular line, like a cat and uttering a tremendous roar.

Right gladly would Semiramis have wrought this deed, yet because of her wound she might not scale the mountains steeps; so, sorrowing at the idleness of many days to come, she offered her servant Huzim as a guide.

The soil does not now contain seeds of forest trees, and in their stead a great variety of weedy-looking shrubs, only found where the land has been cultivated, spring up. Grass, too, begins to get a hold on the ground; if it prevails, the Indian, or Mestizo, does not...", "...smoked quietly on his cigarette.

And yet--yet---- Would that at the very beginning he had told the truth, and stood where Andrew Westwood stood, so that the ruffian and the poacher might not have to bear a doom that separated him for ever from his only child! \"Do you mean,\" said Jenny Westwood slowly, \"that father will never come out of prison any more?\" \"Perhaps--after many years--he may come out.\" \"Many years? Three--or five?\" \"More--more, I am afraid, my little girl--perhaps in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years--if he is still alive.\" He scarcely knew what impulse prompted him then to tell her the truth. He repented it the next moment, for, after a horrified stare into his face, the child suddenly flung herself down upon the gravelled path and burst into tears, accompanied by passionate shrieking sobs and wild convulsive movements of her limbs. \"He shall come out--he shall come out!\" Hubert heard her cry between her gasps for breath. \"He can't do without me.

They allowed the camels to go so lazily, that although we had travelled since early in the morning until late in the evening, we had not gone more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or twenty-two miles, not faster than an ox- waggon would have gone. I made them understand that this negligence must not happen again. I must now take occasion to contradict those persons who affirm that the camel can travel on the average eighty miles daily, and that even when they go slowly, their steps are very long.

But the quick-witted Wolfe saw a way to prevent such action. He promptly moved that the Senate reconsider the vote by which it had refused to concur in the Assembly amendment. Wolfe commanded twenty votes of the Senators present, the anti-machine element nineteen. Wolfe required, however, twenty-one to compel reconsideration. But when the question came up, Wolfe still lacked the one vote necessary for reconsideration, the anti-machine element was still without the necessary <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> votes to tie the Senate, thus giving Warren Porter the deciding vote. Wolfe, however, with his twenty votes, postponed consideration of his motion to reconsider the vote by which the Senate had refused to concur.

All business was practically suspended. For hours the reform Senators were compelled to sit in...", "...is an extremely silent bird, and to a great extent, solitary, outside the breeding season. The noises made during the nuptial flight have already been dealt with, but it is characteristic of the species that when flushed, unlike the common snipe, it nearly always rises in silence. Naumann, however, writes that on rare occasions, generally toward evening, a weak, high-pitched note may be uttered, like \"_Kitz_\" or \"_Kutz_,\" which he compares to a bat's squeak. One may, however, put up <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> birds one after another without hearing anything, though very rarely a single \"_ahtch_\" is uttered, much more softly than the corresponding note of the common snipe.

Mr. Markham thinks that Garcilasso, writing when he did, and not consciously exaggerating, was yet less trustworthy (though 'wonderfully accurate') than Christoval. Garcilasso, however, is 'scrupulously truthful.'[23] 'The excellence of his memory is perhaps best shown in his topographical details.... He does not make a single mistake,' in the topography of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> places! A scrupulously truthful gentleman, endowed with an amazing memory, and a master of his native language, flatly contradicts the version of a Spanish priest, who also appears to have been careful and honourable.

They say that they have been pleading against him for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years, and give very definite references. The jury summoned declares in their favour. The earl opposes them by the astonishing answer that they are not his tenants at all. It all ends by the collapse of the plaintiffs for no apparent reason; they do not come into court ultimately, and the jurors plead guilty of having given a false verdict; see App. VII.

The woods were very thick in my front and not relishing the idea of being killed with such limited opportunity of returning the favor, I shifted my position to the leeward side of a red oak, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty feet to the left where the woods were more open and a Federal rifle pit in front was only partially hidden from my view.

But though the English system, by thus keeping the capital out of sight, is preserved from hasty destruction, as in the case of America and France, it nevertheless approaches the same fate, and will arrive at it with the same certainty, though by a slower progress. The difference is altogether in the degree of speed by which the two systems approach their fate, which, to speak in round numbers, is as <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> is to one; that is, the English system, that of funding the capital instead of issuing it, contained within itself a capacity of enduring twenty times longer than the systems adopted by America and France; and at the end of that time it would arrive at the same common grave, the Potter's Field of paper money. The datum, I take for this proportion of twenty to one, is the difference between a capital and the interest at five per cent. Twenty times the interest is equal to the...", "...but I had not time to propose anything before he started off at such a rate that I was obliged to run to follow him: the worst symptoms were betrayed by his gait, by the congestion of face and neck, and by the hard stare of the eyes.

I saw that a sure instinct was guiding him out of the crowded street to the by-ways and least frequented places, and I strove to remain by his side.

It was rather crude farming, however, consisting mostly of felling trees, cutting wood and saw-logs, burning brush, and digging out stumps, the axe and pick-axe finding more use than ordinary farm implements. Seven miles down the river, and on the opposite bank, lived the nearest neighbors, among them a blacksmith who in his trade served the whole country for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles around. One especial part of his business was the repairing of axes, called in that day \"jumping,\" or \"upsetting.\" In midwinter Evan's employer left a couple of axes with the blacksmith for repairs, the job to be done within a week.

But three or four days later, there came a \"January thaw.\" Rain and a warmer temperature melted away much of the snow,...", "...It was a gruesome sight, in the hour before sunset, with not a soul but ourselves for miles around. The lowering sun lighted up the under side of the leaves and branches and their strange burdens, giving an effect uncanny and weird, as though caused by unseen footlights.

Five of the six trees bore oblong bundles, wrapped in comforters and blankets, and bound with buckskin to the branches near the trunk, fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet from the ground, too high for coyotes, too tight for vultures. But what caught our attention as we dropped into the gully was one of the bundles that had slipped from its fastenings and was hanging by a thong. It needed but a tug to pull it to the ground.

This same slightly aerated fermentable liquid fermented much more rapidly than the other. In eight or ten days it contained no more sugar; while the other, after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> days, still contained an appreciable quantity. Is this last fact to be explained by the greater quantity of yeast formed in B? By no means.

The whole party then ascended the crags to look after Omrah--all but Begum, who would not venture. They had hardly gained the summit when they heard Omrah's voice below, but could not see him. \"There he is, sir,\" said Swanevelt, \"down below there.\" Swinton and the Major went down again, and at last, guided by the shouts of the boy, they came to a narrow cleft in the rock, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet deep, at the bottom of which they heard, but could not see, the boy. The cleft was so narrow that none of the men could squeeze down it. Swinton sent one of them back for some leathern thongs or a piece of rope to let down to him. During the delay, Bremen inquired of Omrah if he was hurt, and received an answer in the negative. When the rope came, and was lowered down to him, Omrah seized it, and was hauled up by the Hottentots. He appeared to have suffered a little, as...", "...the largest single block of stock in existence, owned by the son of the original discoverer of the prospect.

Of course, Tomlinson dropped the subject, but after that the Colonel and he rather drifted apart. Then quite by accident, two or three weeks later, our friend stumbled on Blake himself--met...", "...A NEW RIVER. One day I crossed over to the mainland in a boat sent for the purpose of examining a small river seen there to open upon a long sandy beach. We found a depth of four feet on the bar at low-water, so had no difficulty in entering--at a quarter of a mile from the mouth the water was quite fresh. We ascended about two miles and a half, when it became necessary to return on account of the shoalness of the stream, the boat* having grounded repeatedly. A party of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> natives made their appearance as soon as we entered the river, and after making ineffectual and repeated attempts to induce us to land, two or three of their number followed us along the bank, while the others made a straight course so as to cut off the windings and meet us at our turning place.

SHERMAN IN NORTH CAROLINA [Cornelia P. Spencer, in Last Ninety Days of the War, pages 214-215.] General Sherman's reputation had preceded him, and the horror and dismay with which his approach was anticipated in the country were fully warranted. The town itself was in a measure defended, so to speak, by General Schofield's preoccupation; but in the vicinity and for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles around the country was most thoroughly plundered and stripped of food, forage, and private property of every description. One of the first of General Sherman's own acts, after his arrival, was of peculiar hardship. One of the oldest and most venerable citizens of the place, with a family of sixteen or eighteen children and grandchildren, most of them females, was ordered, on a notice of a few hours, to vacate his house, which of course was done. The gentleman was nearly 80...", "...spoke of the river all the afternoon. And when the season was over I went up to Maidenhead too.

He laid his foundation in the edge of the timber to lessen the distance his material must be moved. He had to fell trees, to lop off the branches, and cut the trunks to proper length, then roll them with infinite effort to their proper place in the structure. He could only gather how a log building could be erected by asking Lachlan, and by taking the Lone Moose cabins for his model.

Some one was counting the turns of the _vrille_. Six, seven, eight; then the airman came out of it on an even keel, and, nosing down to gather speed, looped twice in quick succession.

While he lay at Carisbrooke Castle, the Earl of Lauderdale, a Covenanter of some eminence, accompanied by the Earl of Lanark, was stealthily admitted into his presence. These men succeeded in making a compromise. Lauderdale and Lanark agreed to raise an army to bring the king back. The king in turn agreed to confirm Presbyterianism for three years; the permanent form of Church Government to be then determined by an assembly of divines, assisted by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> commissioners to be appointed by the king. This private treaty is known in history as \"The Engagement.\" It contained the elements of a base and disastrous surrender of principle. Presbyterianism on probation! Built upon the rock of truth, it lasts while the rock endures. Presbyterianism to be succeeded by an uncertainty? How could the Church entrust the government of God's house to the king's commissioners?

After much talk of their Californian days, Seth told him that he was going as lieutenant to an English gentleman who was getting up a mining expedition to Dakota. \"I want eight or ten good miners, afraid neither of work nor Indians.\" \"What pay?\" Noah asked laconically. \"Two dollars a day each, and all grub; double to you, Noah, if you will get a good gang together and come with us.\" \"It's a bargain,\" said Noah. \"I could put my hand on <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> good men to-morrow; half of 'em were out with me.

And they ought to be that, for it will be no child's play; the Injins of Dakota are snakes upon miners.\" Seth had received full authority from Mr Rawlings to engage a strong party, and the \"Boss\" was greatly pleased upon his arrival to find that a band of stalwart and experienced miners had already been collected. Previous to quitting Chicago, Mr Rawlings, acting under the advice of Seth...", "...the spot where the canoe had been buried. To this the young man objected most vehemently, declaring that although he had deserted his father and brother, yet he would not betray them. These feelings were too delicate to meet with much sympathy from the rude borderers who surrounded him, and he was given to understand that nothing short of conducting them to the point of embarkation, would be accepted as an evidence of his sincerity.--With obvious reluctance he at length complied. From <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> to thirty men were quickly assembled, mounted upon good horses, and under the guidance of the deserter, they moved rapidly towards the mouth of Licking. On the road the young man informed them that he would first conduct them to the spot, where they had encamped when the scream of the owl alarmed his father, and where an iron kettle had been concealed in a hollow tree. He was probably induced to do this from the hope of delaying the pursuit so long as to afford his friends an...", "...I mean, it does not make a nation rich or poor, since the rarer it is the more it will purchase of the necessaries of life. A pound's weight of gold, in ancient Greece, or in Mediaeval Europe, would purchase as much wheat as twenty pounds' weight will purchase to-day. If the mines of Mexico or Peru or California had never been worked, the gold in the civilized world three hundred years ago would have been as valuable for banking purposes, or as an exchange for agricultural products, as <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> times its present quantity, since it would have bought as much as twenty times the quantity will buy to-day.

A crop of eight bushels, which one Hadley farmer had in 1763, was large--too large, since \"if a man ate them every day he could not live beyond seven years.\" Indeed, the \"gallant root of potatoes\" was regarded as a sort of forbidden fruit--a root more than suspected of being an over-active aphrodisiac, and withal so wholly abandoned as not to have been mentioned in the Bible; and when Parson Jonathan Hubbard, of Sheffield, raised <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> bushels in one year, it is said he came very near being dealt with by his church for his wicked hardihood. In more than one town the settlers fancied the balls were the edible portion, and \"did not much desire them.\" Nor were fashionable methods of cooking them much more to be desired.

Yet occasionally, without any known cause, batches of eggs are produced, which immediately begin to undergo the proper changes, and are hatched in from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> to thirty days. From these and some other analogous facts it may be concluded that the Trevoltini silkworms of Italy, of which the caterpillars are hatched in from fifteen to twenty days, do not necessarily form, as has been maintained, a distinct species.

While he was thus employed a farming man came into the barn. Jack instantly started to his feet, and the man, alarmed at his appearance, ran off to a neighbouring house. Before he could return, Jack had made good his retreat; and, wandering about the lanes and hedges, kept out of sight as much as possible. On examining his pockets, he found about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> guineas in gold, and some silver. But how to avail himself of it was the question, for in his present garb he was sure to be recognised. When night fell, he crept into the town of Tottenham. As he passed along the main thoroughfare, he heard his own name pronounced, and found that it was a hawker, crying a penny history of his escapes.

Now although the place where he built was greatly opposite to his purposes, yet did he so fully struggle with that difficulty, that the firmness of his building could not easily be conquered by the sea; and the beauty and ornament of the works were such, as though he had not had any difficulty in the operation; for when he had measured out as large a space as we have before mentioned, he let down stones into <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> fathom water, the greatest part of which were fifty feet in length, and nine in depth, and ten in breadth, and some still larger. But when the haven was filled up to that depth, he enlarged that wall which was thus already extant above the sea, till it was two hundred feet wide; one hundred of which had buildings before it, in order to break the force of the waves, whence it was called Procumatia, or the first breaker of the waves; but the rest of the space was under a stone...", "...the tasks that lay before it. Of the wildness and rudeness of this new world there could be no question, but its savagery was met by a savage determination more fearless and indomitable than its own. The mountain trapper, the prairie freighter and trader, the California miner were great men, tremendous men, fit successors of those that fought their way across the Alleghanies. The fur trade was practically over by 1834, and the Santa Fe trade lasted, roughly speaking, only about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years, being practically terminated in 1843 by the edict of Santa Anna. These difficulties in our Western commerce all came to an end with the Mexican War, and with the second and third great additions to our Western territory, which gave us the region on the south as well as the north, from ocean to ocean. This time was one of great activity in all the West, and the restless population that had gained a taste of the adventurous life of that region was soon to have yet greater...", "...if you please, and put a drop of--but the Sculptor had already foreseen and was then forestalling my needs, so we leaned back in our chairs once more.

All the men on each side fight, and the bridegroom has to carry off the bride by force. Then they all sit down, and feast together.

For ten years of poverty and severe toil he was engaged, for the sake of a livelihood, in the nursery business, making, in the meantime, such experiments as he had time for. During the next <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years, however, Mr. Burbank was able to give nearly his whole time to his nature-studies.

Over and over I heard it. My heart beat to its shrill music, my fingers tattooed it on the bed cover, I could hardly lie still. Why had it come to me at this hour? I had forgotten it for so long--so long. Doubtless its memory had been evoked by Lilly's cheerful resolute exclamation, \"What a game it will be!\" For it was easy...", "...that thus reanimated the past? No. What, then?

Among the persons he had met, perhaps one might have resembled some one he had known, and, although he had not recognized it, it might have rung in his heart all the chords of the past. Was it not a sound, rather? Very often he had heard by chance a piano, an unknown voice, even a hand-organ in the street playing some old air, which had suddenly made him feel <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years younger, filling his breast with tender recollections, long buried. But this appeal, continued, incessant, intangible, almost irritating! What was there near him to revive thus his extinct emotions? \"It is growing a little cool; we must go home,\" he said.

Annette also observed them, and felt disturbed at the thought of their lives,...", "...in the fortress. Under the color of an excursion, such as she had been daily accustomed to take, she found no difficulty in placing Paulina, sufficiently disguised, amongst her own servants.

It took as long to make it, and furnished food for as much rustic enquiry and comment, as does a voyage to Europe now. Uncle Abe had then given up rail-splitting, and was studying law. Having a little while before treated himself to a (then) rare thing, a suit of \"store clothes;\" and a neighbor being about to leave for St. Louis, he resolved to go along.

At last Argus grew so old and feeble that he could not run about the palace. All day long he lay in the warm, sunny courtyard, too weak to move. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years since he had heard his master's voice. One day a beggar came into the courtyard. No one knew who he was. The queen looked at him coldly. There was no friendly face to greet him. But the old dog lifted up his head and whined and wagged his tail for joy. The beggar's rags could not deceive him. He knew his master had come back at last, and Ulysses stooped to caress him with tears in his eyes. The most famous dog in the world was a mastiff of St. Bernard's. His name was...", "...for revenge.

By this abstinence from fermented liquors he kept quite free from the gout for fifteen or sixteen years; and then began to take small-beer mixed with water occasionally, or wine and water, or perry and water, or cyder and water; by which indulgence after a few months he had again a paroxysm of gout, which continued about three days in the ball of his toe; which occasioned him to return to his habit of drinking water, and has now for above <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years kept in perpetual health, except accidental colds from the changes of the seasons. Before he abstained from fermented or spirituous liquors, he was frequently subject to the piles, and to the gravel, neither of which he has since experienced. In the following case the gout was established by longer habit and greater violence, and therefore required more cautious treatment. The Rev. R.

A few days after, the air was filled with Ephemera flies, and the same species of birds were then feeding upon them.\" During the outbreak of Rocky Mountain locusts in Nebraska in 1874-1877, Professor Samuel Aughey saw a long-billed marsh wren carry thirty locusts to her young in an hour. At this rate, for seven hours a day, a brood would consume 210 locusts per day, and the passerine birds of the eastern half of Nebraska, allowing only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> broods to the square mile, would destroy daily 162,771,000 of the pests. The average locust weighs about fifteen grains, and is capable each day of consuming its own weight of standing forage crops, which at $10 per ton would be worth $1743.26. This case may serve as an illustration of the vast good that is done every year by the destruction of insect pests fed to nestling birds. And it should be remembered that the nesting season is also...", "...afterwards at Ampanam, I found that no earthquake had been noticed, but that on one night there had been a very heavy surf, which shook the house, and the next day there was a very high tide, the water having flooded Mr. Carter's premises, higher than he had ever known it before. These unusual tides occur every now and then, and are not thought much of; but by careful inquiry I ascertained that the surf had occurred on the very night I had felt the earthquake at Labuan Tring, nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles off. This would seem to indicate, that although the ordinary heavy surf may be due to the swell of the great Southern Ocean confined in a narrow channel, combined with a peculiar form of bottom near the shore, yet the sudden heavy surfs and high tides that occur occasionally in perfectly calm weather, may be due to slight upheavals of the ocean-bed in this eminently volcanic region.

These, with the blue-coloured Heron, and a small bird of the Passerine kind, were all that we saw here. Of vegetable productions, we procured a hardy species of vine, Vitis Labrusca, common in the forest; it was covered with great quantities of grapes, which, though not yet quite ripe, were not ungrateful to the taste. The vine stretches along the trees, often to the distance of fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> yards. We found also two species of Palm, and an elegant tree of the Nat. Ord. Guttiferae was discovered by Mr. Crawfurd; its affinity to Garcinia is well marked, but as the leading characters do not agree with those of that plant, it is not improbable that ours will form a new genus. An elegant species of Begonia, apparently the Begonia crenata, grows in the greatest abundance on the bare rocks, and on the sides of the hills. Pandanus, Scaevola, Ixora, Momordica,...", "...would surpass that bird! It has all the vivacity and versatility of the canary, without any of its shrillness. Its song is indeed a little cascade of melody. We again retraced our steps, rolling the stone, as it were, back up the mountain, determined to commit ourselves to the line of marked trees. These we finally reached, and, after exploring the country to the right, saw that bearing to the left was still the order. The trail led up over a gentle rise of ground, and in less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes we were in the woods I had passed through when I found the lake. The error I had made was then plain; we had come off the mountain a few paces too far to the right, and so had passed down on the wrong side of the ridge, into what we afterwards learned was the valley of Alder Creek. We now made good time, and before many minutes I again saw the mimic sky glance through the trees. As we approached the lake a solitary woodchuck, the first wild animal we had seen since...", "...and longing, of course, to hear all about the murder at first hand.

THIS was a great relief, for I was suffering more from my humiliating position, being unable to stand, than from the tortures themselves. The Pombo told me that I must now look towards the tent, and then got up and walked towards it. The opening of the tent was over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet long. Some soldiers came and dragged me close to the front of it, so that I could witness all that went on. Two big Lamas entered the tent with the Pombo, and a number of other people who were inside were turned out. They closed the tent for a few minutes, and then opened it again. In the meantime a gong summoned the Lamas of the monastery to come down, and, a few minutes later, a string of them came and took their places inside the tent. The Pombo, in his yellow coat...", "...receives twenty four per cent. on his money. This is one source of the insurrection in Massachusetts. The people feel the injustice of paying such an interest to men who earned but a small part of it, and whose sole merit is, that they have more money than their fellow citizens who suffer the loss by depreciation. Those men in particular, who fought for our independence, or loaned their property to save the country, view with indignant resentment, that law which obliges them to pay <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> four per cent. interest on the securities, which they have sold for a fourth, or an eighth part of their honest demands. This cannot justify the violent steps taken by the people; because petitions, and united firmness in a constitutional way, would have procured redress. But I state the facts to shew the effects of speculation, or rather, of the want of faith in public engagements.

In less than an hour's time the whole heap had been disposed of, with the exception of fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> letters selected for consideration on account of their addresses. These Miss Starbrow carefully went over, and finally selecting one she read it aloud to Fan. It was from a Mrs. Churton, an elderly lady, residing with her husband, a retired barrister, and her daughter, in their own house at a small place called Eyethorne, in Wiltshire. She offered to take the girl into her house, treat her as her own child, and give her instruction, for seventy pounds a year. The tuition would...", "...have asked her to be my wife.

The central situation may be used, but for success on the stage the story must be so re-told that the marked changes in feeling are convincing even when seen.

The blocks were two inches square and there were eight each way; in fact, it was a copy of the chessboard her father had made.

This rest camp and its drills were not destined to become monotonous, however, for instead of ten days they had but one day. Orders came from \"G. H.

This meant more hard hiking and more rough traveling for horses and motor trucks until the units again were \"bedded down\" temporarily, with division headquarters at Les Islettes, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles due north from Revigny, and eight miles south of what was then, and had been for many weary months, the front line.

The housewives are minutely frugal; they will claim a rebate on a lacking pennyweight in the pound; but it is scarcely to be admitted that any economy could lower the expense of necessary outside provisioning to such a sum. Still, quintupling it even, the hotel, at the spa a mile away, will charge you the same <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> sous for a cup of coffee, and considerably more for the lightest meal. The disproportion is thus seen to be enormous. Yet at its highest it is not burdensome to a comer from richer countries. The hotel prices themselves halt at a certain mark, and marbled buildings and aristocratic prestige cannot force them higher. Wealthy idleness, Continental idleness in particular, knows to a nicety the sums it is willing to pay for its pleasures. It pays that cheerfully.

The story that it was here that Cain killed Abel is alluded to by Shakespeare (I King Henry VI, I, 3).

Grant was operating against Vicksburg, and Banks would certainly undertake the reduction of Port Hudson; but it was probable that he would first clear the west bank of the Mississippi to prevent interruption of his communications with New Orleans, threatened so long as we had a force on the lower Atchafalaya and Teche. Banks had <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand men for the field, while my force, including Green's Texans, would not exceed twenty-seven hundred, with many raw recruits, and badly equipped.

There is left to our eyes but a poor vestige of the picturesque view presented to those who looked down the rue Royale before the garish day that changed the rue Enghien into Ingine street, and dropped the 'e' from Royale. It was a long, narrowing perspective of arcades, lattices, balconies, _zaguans_, dormer windows, and blue sky--of low, tiled roofs, red and wrinkled, huddled down into their own shadows; of canvas awnings with fluttering borders, and of grimy lamp-posts <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet in height, each reaching out a gaunt iron arm over the narrow street and dangling a lamp from its end. The human life which dotted the view displayed a variety of tints and costumes such as a painter would be glad to take just as he found them: the gayly feathered Indian, the slashed and tinselled Mexican, the leather-breeched raftsmen, the blue-or yellow-turbaned _negresse_, the sugar-planter in white flannel and moccasins, the average townsman in the last suit of clothes...", "...opening her eyes in amazement. \"I don't know what his notions may be--but mine----oh, father!\" she cried, emboldened by the smile she saw on the old man's countenance, \"you are only trying me; say you are only proving my constancy, by persuading me that such a being as that has any wish to please me.

He did not let his beard grow, though he had, or believed that he had, for he was hypochondriacal, a sensitiveness of the skin that forced him to spend an hour in shaving, and he would take to club and dumb-bell if his waist thickened by a hair's breadth, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years after, when a very old man, he had the erect shapely figure of his youth. I often wondered why he went through so much labour, for it was not pride, which had seemed histrionic in his eyes--and certainly he had no vanity; and now, looking back, I am convinced that it was from habit, mere habit, a habit formed when he was a young man, and the best rider of his district.

Many years, as we have seen, had now elapsed, since that portentous night when the IDEA was first developed. The kiln, however, on the mountain-side stood unimpaired, and was in nothing changed since he had thrown his dark thoughts into the intense glow of its furnace, and melted them, as it were, into the one thought that took possession of his life. It was a rude, round, towerlike structure, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet high, heavily built of rough stones, and with a hillock of earth heaped about the larger part of its circumference; so that the blocks and fragments of marble might be drawn by cart-loads, and thrown in at the top. There was an opening at the bottom of the tower, like an oven-mouth, but large enough to admit a man in a stooping posture, and provided with a massive iron door. With the smoke and jets of flame issuing from the chinks and crevices of this door, which seemed to...", "...plants in two ways. First, they draw off all their sap, which is really their life-blood; and then they drop this sticky honeydew on to the leaves below, and choke up the little holes by means of which they breathe. And the worst of it is that these insects multiply so rapidly. Where there is one to-day there will be five and twenty to-morrow; and two days later there will be five and twenty times five and twenty; and two days later still there will be five and twenty times five and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> times five and twenty! Indeed, if it were not for ladybirds and lacewing flies and one or two other insects which feed upon aphides, every green leaf would be destroyed by them in a few months' time. A very curious fact about these insects is that as long as they can find plenty of food they do not grow any wings. But as soon as the sap becomes scanty or thin, wings make their appearance, so that they can fly away and seek for better food elsewhere.

In addition to a black frost, there came with it a biting, piercing, easterly wind, which seemed to freeze and wither every thing it came upon. Pending this infliction (for I confess I suffered under sciatica as well as the easterly wind), I left home rather early one morning, muffled in two coats, a cloak, muffler, \"bosom friend,\" worsted wrists, and woolsey gloves; and yet as I closed the door, I half repented that I had faced the blast. Not <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> yards from my dwelling, I overtook a little creature, a boy of about eight or nine years old, dressed in--of all the cold things in the world--a _hard_ corduroy habiliment, intended to have fitted closely to him; but his wretched, frozen-up form, seemed to have retreated from the dress, and sunk within itself. I believe he had not another stitch upon him. His little hands were buried into his pockets, almost up to the elbows, seeking some warmth from his body; and he crept on...", "...The wind was at north, and we steered east-by-north, which is but one point in on the land; yet we decreased our water very fast, for at four we had but nine fathom, the next cast but seven, which frightened us; and we then tacked instantly and steed off, but in a short time the wind coming at north-west and west-north-west, we tacked again and steered north-north-east, and then deepened our water again, and had all night from fifteen to twenty fathom.

His enthusiasm for nature was but the drivelling sensibility of the drunkard. Nor had Mackintosh any sympathy for his chief's feelings towards the natives. He loved them because they were in his power, as a selfish man loves his dog, and his mentality was on a level with theirs.

One day, early in the winter of 1868, when Lord Randolph was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years old, he had the misfortune to ride too close to the Old Berkshire Hounds and to incur the displeasure of their Master, who rated him in a very violent fashion before the whole company.

He was firm as a rock; he would ride post haste <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles to pardon a deserter, but under no consideration could he be induced to suspend hostilities against a people who were trying to destroy the Union.

The county's farmers had spent much of the inter-war period adjusting to the new agricultural modes, but they could not adapt to the burgeoning metropolitan area's desire for expansion.

Yet it is hard to believe that agriculture in any part of the Union would steadily decline in the face of an enormous appreciation of the cost to the consumer of all farm products, were there not some powerful disturbing factor operating to deny the farmer the benefits of that appreciation. If the Eastern farmer could have reaped a legitimate share of the increase in the price of farm produce which has taken place in the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years, he would certainly be in position to command all the labor he needs and to develop resources now neglected because it does not pay to develop them.

There were gooseberries and currants; but the most delicious fruit, and that which Francois liked best, was a small berry of a dark blue colour, not unlike the huckleberry, but much sweeter and of higher flavour.

There are no less than four varieties of it known, two of which attain to the height of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet or more. The French Canadians call it \"le poire,\" but in most parts of America it is known as the \"service-berry,\" although several other names are given to it in different districts.

Born at Madrid, where he spent most of his life, Lope was an infant prodigy who fulfilled the promise of his youth. His first play was written at the age of thirteen. He fought against the Portuguese in the expedition of 1583 and took part in the disastrous Armada of 1588.

Lope's writings include some 2000 plays, of which perhaps 500 are extant, epics, pastorals, parodies, short stories and minor poems beyond telling.

Again, we may suppose that he would see the figure 7 invariably half a point to the left of the ship, at an altitude equal to the sun's diameter above the horizon, and at thirty feet distance; similarly for all the other figures.

At which time of Mr. Herbert's coming alone to Bemerton, there came to him a poor old woman, with an intent to acquaint him with her necessitous condition, as also with some troubles of her mind: but after she had spoke some few words to him, she was surprised with a fear, and that begot a shortness of breath, so that her spirits and speech failed her; which he perceiving, did so compassionate her, and was so humble, that he took her by the hand, and said,...", "...is accurate and painstaking.

CHAPTER XXII DO IT TO A FINISH Years ago a relief lifeboat at New London sprung a leak, and while being repaired a hammer was found in the bottom that had been left there by the builders thirteen years before. From the constant motion of the boat the hammer had worn through the planking, clear down to the plating. Not long since, it was discovered that a girl had served twenty years for a <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> months' sentence, in a southern prison, because of the mistake of a court clerk who wrote \"years\" instead of \"months\" in the record of the prisoner's sentence. The history of the human race is full of the most horrible tragedies caused by carelessness and the inexcusable blunders of those who never formed the habit of accuracy, of thoroughness, of doing things to a finish.

Around this natural castle the Indian tribes gathered to La Salle, as to a sovereign,--Miamis, Abenakis, and Shawanoes, from countries eastward, and the Illinois returned to spread over their beloved meadow. Instead of one town, many towns of log, or rush, or bark lodges could be seen from the summit of the Rock. Years afterwards the French still spoke of this fortress as Le Rocher. A little principality of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand inhabitants, strong enough to repel any attack of the Iroquois, thus helped to guard it. La Salle meant to supply his people with goods and give them a market for their furs.

Now, however, the rainfall for some days having been slight, it was likely that the water was two men's height below the trestles of which the bridge was made. This information caused Tom to change his objective. Instead of continuing along the forest track that led directly to the scouting post, he followed the course of the stream, and in some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes came in sight of the bridge far below. Calling a halt, he sent one of the men to the scouting post on a hill-top invisible from his present position, to inquire of the man stationed there whether he had seen anything of the enemy's columns, or of patrols. The scout's report being reassuring, Tom led his party down to the road, through the brushwood, rank grass, and bushy shrubs that lined the bank of the stream. The ground within twenty yards of the road had...", "...an inch of steel left to cut with or an ounce of reserved strength to go on farther.

This tunnel would come out close to the sentry beat of the guards, but Rose had noticed that this beat was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> yards long and it was decided that in the dark there would be a fair chance of slipping through unseen. Once again Rose and Hamilton started on this new task alone. They had finally obtained another chisel and this was the only tool which they had. Once more Rose did the digging.

The enemy being routed with a great slaughter, (for it is said, that of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand there escaped but three thousand,) the army saluted Pompey by the name of Imperator; but he declined it, telling them, that he could not by any means accept of that title, as long as he saw the camp of the enemy standing; but if they designed to make him worthy of the honor, they must first demolish that.

A little farther on we found water at the foot of a little hill, and there halted.

As smoke dissipates, as the image glides from the mirror, so in the ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes that I had spent in getting my horse and following upon his trail, had that strong and brave man vanished out of life. Hope, if any hope we had, fled with every hour; the worst was now certain for my father, the worst was to be dreaded for his defenceless family.

Their guns were raking her at this time from head to stern in such a way that none of her guns could be brought effectually to bear on them. In this state she remained for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes, scarcely going ahead, and receiving the fire of seven eighteen-pounders, several of which were pointed down on her decks. During this time she fired away in return at the enemy, who appeared abreast of her, every charge of grape and canister on board, and was then reduced to round shot.

They had been lying off here for days, waiting for the news the British agent had been trying hard to obtain for them, so as to enable the officer in command of her Majesty's cruiser to strike a severe blow at the horrible traffic being carried on by swift-sailing schooners and barques trading between the West Coast of Africa and the southern ports of the United States.

Drizzling mist, which had shrouded Tukcham all the morning, soon gathered on this mountain, and prevented any prospect from the highest point reached; but on the ascent I had an excellent view up the Zemu, which opened into a broad grassy valley, where I saw with the glass some wooden sheds, but no cattle or people.

That fault at any rate I shall not try to cure.\" The Divorce of Katharine of Aragon, though not published till 1891, is a sequel to the History.

The matter contained in these momentous memorials occupies from eighteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> closely-written sheets, and is always prefaced with the imposing heading: 'Yo, el Rey' (I, the King). Pancho's indigence and infatuation have a romantic origin. This old, shabby-looking object before me was at one time a well-to-do planter, and held a high position among merchants.

Zape! a bad sight that was. \"It must have been a long time since they had died, months, perhaps years, two or three, from the look of the place and the bones. The coyotes had been in, and nothing but the bones and some bits of clothing was left. They had all been men, at least I think so, because there were no women's clothes. In the box there were pieces of money, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty, or perhaps more. I did not like to touch it, with the dead men all about there: but Pedro, he was always one who cared for nothing. He said it was lucky to find them: the money wasn't dead, he said, and he laughed at me. He picked up one of the coins: it was a silver peso of Spain, very old. Was it not strange, senor? All the money was the same, all pesos and all old. I. have never seen any more like them.\" \"Well, Pedro said we ought to take the money. The dead men...", "...some temptation to do base things, in order to procure to himself, as it would then be, everlasting ease, plenty, or affluence; but, for the sake of ten, twenty, thirty years of poor life to be a villain--Can that be worth while? with a conscience stinging him all the time too!

In a paper published in 1862 Sir William Thomson (now Lord Kelvin) first endeavored to show that great limitation had to be put upon the enormous demand for time made by Lyell, Darwin and other biologists. From a consideration [711] of the secular cooling of the earth, as deduced from the increasing temperature in deep mines, he concluded that the entire age of the earth must have been more than twenty and less than forty millions of years, and probably much nearer <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> than forty. His views have been much criticised by other physicists, but in the main they have gained an ever-increasing support in the way of evidence. New mines of greater depth have been bored, and their temperatures have proved that the figures of Lord Kelvin are strikingly near the truth. George Darwin has calculated that the separation of the moon from the earth must have taken place some fifty-six millions of years ago. Geikie has estimated the existence of the solid...", "...a later hour with his battalion. On presenting himself at quarters he learned to his surprise that Monte Rotondo had not surrendered yet, though news of the catastrophe was expected every moment.

In less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes after he had stationed himself at the entrance, Faustina ascended the steps accompanied by a servant.

The path was wide and gravelled, but somewhat overgrown with weeds. It often bifurcated to surround a grove of shrubs, or shade trees. The whole garden wore a rank, uncared-for look. The plantations were thick with undergrowth. In certain beds the unpruned rose-bushes had become giants, and had grown into thickets, while in others grasses choked all memory of cultivation. The place was in fact a wilderness. The cover was so excellent, that I was able to insinuate myself within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> paces of the building, without risk of discovery. Striking aside from the road at that point, I sneaked into a grove of laurels, that commanded a view of two sides of the house. There I cast myself down upon the ground, and although perfectly defended from the keenest observation myself, by peering through the weeds and tree trunks, I could watch both path and house, as well as any spy could wish to do.

Is this freedom? Is this what Mr. Burke means by a constitution? In these chartered monopolies, a man coming from another part of the country is hunted from them as if he were a foreign enemy. An Englishman is not free of his own country; every one of those places presents a barrier in his way, and tells him he is not a freeman--that he has no rights. Within these monopolies are other monopolies. In a city, such for instance as Bath, which contains between <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> and thirty thousand inhabitants, the right of electing representatives to Parliament is monopolised by about thirty-one persons. And within these monopolies are still others. A man even of the same town, whose parents were not in circumstances to give him an occupation, is debarred, in many cases, from the natural right of acquiring one, be his genius or industry what it may.

Divide this amount of reading among history, philosophy, chemistry, biography, and general literature, and the reader will be well versed in these several departments of knowledge.

In Nebraska there are four great soil regions. Some of them are very fertile; some 40,000 square miles are unusually fertile, the land values ranging from $100 to $200 per acre. We have 18,000 square miles of land worth from $1.00 to $5.00 per acre. I am not going to take the time to tell you...", "...feel the pinch first, and feel it worst. They are rum beggars, the Boches. Think of the higher command marking out the early stages of the war by the dinners it was going to have,--every menu carefully planned, one for Brussels, one for Paris, and probably one for London! I remember lunching at a hotel when I was in Berlin, and seeing rather a curious thing. There was a table in the center of the room, laid for what was evidently going to be a very grand affair. It was laid for about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> people, and I saw a thing I had never seen before. Every champagne glass contained a peach. I asked my waiter what it meant, and he said that von Schramm, the fellow who is one of the moving spirits behind this new submarine campaign, was entertaining some of his pals that day; and this was one of his pretty little fads. He thought it improved the wine, and also that it prevented gout, or some rot of that sort.\" \"How very German! My chief objection would be that there wouldn't...", "...it seemed plain, from the writings of Homer, in spite of poetical embellishment, that their mode of fighting was irregular, and their arms simple, like those of Otaheite. The united efforts of Greece against Troy, in remote antiquity, could not be much more considerable than the armament of Otoo against the isle of Eimea; and the boasted _mille carinae_ were probably not more formidable than a fleet of large canoes, which require from fifty to an hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> men, to paddle them. The navigation of the Greeks, in those days, was not more extensive than that which is practised by the Otaheitans at present, being confined to short passages from island to island; and as the stars at night directed the mariners through the Archipelago at that time, so they still continue to guide others in the Pacific Ocean. The Greeks were brave; but the numerous wounds of the Otaheitan chiefs, are all proofs of their spirit...", "...same ground in corn would not support a single family. A pound of oil, which can be bought for three or four pence sterling, is equivalent to many pounds of flesh, by the quantity of vegetables it will prepare, and render fit and comfortable food. Without this tree, the country of Provence and territory of Genoa would not support one-half, perhaps not one-third, their present inhabitants. The nature of the soil is of little consequence if it be dry. The trees are planted from fifteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet apart, and when tolerably good, will yield fifteen or twenty pounds of oil yearly, one with another. There are trees which yield much more. They begin to render good crops at twenty years old, and last till killed by cold, which happens at some time or other, even in their best positions in France. But they put out again from their roots. In Italy, I am told, they have trees two hundred years old. They afford an easy but constant employment through the year, and require so...", "...to retrieve that disaster, and determined, in the spring, to take the offensive by attacking Ticonderoga. This had been left, on the retirement of Montcalm, with a small garrison commanded by Captain Hepecourt, who, during the winter, was continually harassed by the corps of Captain Rogers, and James Walsham's scouts. Toward the spring, receiving reinforcements, Hepecourt caught Rogers and a hundred and eighty men in an ambush, and killed almost all of them; Rogers himself, and some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty men, alone escaping. In the spring there was a fresh change of plans. The expedition against Ticonderoga was given up, as another attempt at Louisbourg was about to be made. The English government were determined that the disastrous delays, which had caused the failure of the last expedition, should not be repeated. Loudon was recalled, and to General Abercromby, the second in command, was intrusted the charge of the forces in the colonies. Colonel Amherst was raised...", "...on the frontiers. We always had wagons enough to carry the tents, knapsacks, provisions and forage. Each soldier carried his arms and accoutrements, his canteen and his haversack, which contained only enough provisions for a noon-day meal. The musicians carried only a sword, canteen and haversack. The speed at which we marched was generally about three miles per hour, or less, if the route was hilly or the marching difficult. About every five miles we halted for a rest of fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes with a somewhat longer rest in the middle of the day. The distance we marched each day averaged less than twenty miles, but it was irregular, for camping places had to be selected with an eye to obtaining wood and water. Some days we marched only about fifteen miles while on others we had to make more than twenty-five. On a few occasions we camped on the prairie, where there was neither wood nor water. We brought a scant supply with us in our wagons from the previous...", "...Ball subscription for 10\" (pounds).

Marshall's practice during his third year at the Richmond bar grew normally.

If left to dry in the mold they will warp because of the unequal absorption. A better method has been devised by the author and has been put into practice with considerable success. When the size of the proposed tile has been determined a board is made which is large enough to hold a square of the tile, say twelve or sixteen. Thus if a tile five inches square is to be made the board would be fifteen by twenty inches for twelve tile or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> inches square for sixteen. On each side of the board a wooden rim is fastened and this must stand higher than the board to the exact thickness of the tile. About five-eighths of an inch is enough. The board must be perfectly rectangular and marked off at even distance of five inches and a shallow groove is cut at each point. To make the tile the board is wetted and an even coating of grog dust is sprinkled upon it. A ball of clay is laid in the center of the board and rolled...", "...they agreed, they had come to the hotel with the blackamoor at the door. While they lingered, sharing the splendid creature's hospitable pleasure in the spectacle he formed, they were aware of a carriage with liveried coachman and footman at the steps of the hotel; the liveries were very quiet and distinguished, and they learned that the equipage was waiting for the Prince of Coburg, or the Princess of Montenegro, or Prince Henry of Prussia; there were differing opinions among the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty bystanders. Mrs. March said she did not care which it was; and she was patient of the denouement, which began to postpone itself with delicate delays.

These Ishmaelites of the animal-world, though common enough in all the wilder regions of Iberia, rarely present themselves as a mark for the rifle-ball. Many-fold more cunning than the fox, the wolf never--not for a single instant--forgets the risk of danger nor his human enemies. When aroused in a _monteria_, or mountain-drive, wolves come slowly forward, feeling their way like field-marshals in an enemy's country, and...", "...my face was _so_ painful that I scarcely dared touch it. And oh, how we perspired! In less than ten minutes my singlet and drawers--which were all that I had on, having like the rest stripped off all the rest of my clothing-- were as wet as though I had been overboard. And the natural result of such profuse perspiration was that we soon became intolerably thirsty. I don't know which of us was the first to suffer from this cause, but I know that I had not been at my oar more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes when I began to feel that I would willingly give everything I possessed for a good long cooling draught of spring water. However, I clenched my teeth and said nothing, for I knew perfectly well that if the word \"thirst\" were once mentioned all hands would instantly begin to clamour for water, and I might have the greatest difficulty in restraining the others from making a raid upon the breakers, regardless of consequences. But, after all, my self-restraint was of...", "...morning,\" remarked Sub-lieutenant Fox as he greeted the officer of the watch, whom he was about to relieve. Eccles, the Lieutenant, who had been on the _Capella's_ bridge for four long and dreary hours, merely nodded sleepily. He was thinking, with feelings of satisfaction, of the hot coffee and fragrant bacon and eggs awaiting him below. Three minutes had to elapse before eight bells. Wearily he rubbed his salt-rimmed eyelids with a heavily gloved hand. \"_Taurus_ wirelessed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes ago,\" he reported, as the two officers entered the chart-room. \"She was then at the extreme limit of her northerly course. You ought to sight her very shortly. Here's our course\"--he indicated the pencilled line on the chart. \"Nothing to report: there never is when I'm officer of the watch.

Another characteristic anecdote betrays his ill-suppressed vexation:-- 'I laughed at myself prodigiously the other day for a piece of absence.

He writhed, fumed, shifted his seat, and the beating of his heart was almost audible. Venn sat with lips impassively closed and eyes reduced to a pair of unimportant twinkles; he scarcely appeared to breathe. He might have been an Arab, or an automaton; he would have been like a red sandstone statue but for the motion of his arm with the dice-box.

And after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> Days or more, having passed their Time in great Miseries, they being desirous to return Home to Spain, sailed very far Southward into the Ocean to recover Spain. \"But the Almighty, who always avenges the Cause of his afflicted People who put their Confidence in Him, and brings down his Enemies who exalt themselves to the Heavens, order'd the Winds to be violently contrarious to this proud Navy, that it was with Force dissevered on the High Seas to the West of Ireland; and so a...", "...Stenches no longer assailed the nostrils, except in the outside circle of destruction, where much debris still remained untouched. Cremation of the dead was being pushed, but it was many days before the working parties got out the last of the bodies. The whole twenty-two miles' length of the island was submerged. The horrors of the western portion beyond the city limits were just being learned at San Luis. One hundred and eighty-one bodies were buried on September 17. Between <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> and thirty bodies were counted among the piles of the railroad bridge between the island and Virginia Point. In Kinkead's addition about 100 were lost, eighteen in one house. The farther the men worked in the Denver reservoir section the more numerous were the dead. Fires were burning every 300 feet on the beach and along many of the streets. Mayor Walter C. Jones made a statement on that day of conditions and needs of Galveston people, basing his conclusions on the most...", "...of a lonely man, across whose front door no visitor had come for weeks, for friendly company; of a weary minister, discouraged by narrow circumstances, monotonous routine, unexpected disappointments among his people, for a word of good cheer. A cynical stranger might discover various stupidities, peculiarities, provincialisms in the Presbytery--he knew himself who had a temper, and who was a trifle sensitive about his rights--but this middle-aged, hard-working, simple-living man saw <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> faithful brethren--the elders did not count in this connection, for they did not understand--who stood beside him on occasion at the Holy Table, and gave him advice in his perplexities, and would bury him with honest regret when he died, and fight like wild cats that his widow and children should have their due. His toilsome journey was forgotten when Doctor Dowbiggin, in an interstice of motions, came across the floor and sat down beside him, and whispered confidentially,...", "...but in the reigns of Charles IX. and Henri III. he was more particularly attached to the suite of the queen dowager and her daughter Marguerite. He was, however, somewhat disappointed in his hopes of recompense; and after hesitating for a time between the Royalists, the Leaguers, and the Spaniards, he left the court, retired into private life, and began to write his memoirs, partly in consequence of a severe accident. He seems to have begun to write about 1594, and he lived for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years longer, dying on the 15th of July, 1614. The form of Brantome's works is, as has been said, peculiar. They are usually divided into two parts, dealing respectively with men and women. The first part in its turn consists of many sub-divisions, the chief of which is made up of the _Vies des Grands Capitaines Etrangers et Francais_, while others consist of separate disquisitions or essays, _Des Rodomontades Espagnoles_, 'On some Duels and Challenges in France' and...", "...said, looked very much like a rudely made, baby's cradle. The body was about the same size and shape as the ordinary homemade box cradle seen in the homes of thousands in those days and underneath it were two similar rockers, but here the resemblance ended. One end of the cradle-box was a little higher than the other end, which was left open, so that the water loaded with the waste dirt could run out; and on the upper end stood a hopper, or riddle-box, as it was frequently called, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> inches square, with sides four inches high and a bottom made of sheet-iron, pierced with holes half an inch in diameter. Directly under the hopper, which was not nailed to the cradle-box, was an apron of wood, fastened to the sides of the cradle-box and sloping down from the lower end of the hopper to the upper end of the cradle-box. Two strips of wood, about an inch square, called riffle-bars, were nailed across the bottom of the cradle-box, one at the middle and the other near...", "...dangled from the lower branches; bunches of grass, tillandsiae, and ferns sat in the forks of the larger boughs, and the trunks of trees near the water had adhering to them round dried masses of freshwater sponges. There was no current perceptible, and the water was stained of a dark olive-brown hue, but the submerged stems could be seen through it to a great depth. We travelled at good speed for three hours along this shady road-- the distance of Pedro's house from Ega being about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles. When the paddlers rested for a time, the stillness and gloom of the place became almost painful: our voices waked dull echoes as we conversed, and the noise made by fishes occasionally whipping the surface of the water was quite startling. A cool, moist, clammy air pervaded the sunless shade. The breadth of the wooded valley, at the commencement, is probably more than half a mile, and there is a tolerably clear view for a considerable distance on each side of the...", "...six, and from which it seemed impossible that any could come out alive. The public must know all about the war, and the only avenue of information is the press. Never before has any war been covered as to its news features with the accuracy and energy which have characterized this. American journalism has outstripped the world. The expense of a news service for this war is something enormous, with little return compensation. Yet the work is done, metropolitan papers have from ten to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> correspondents in the field, and the public has the benefit. Dispatch boats follow the fleets and are present at every battle. They must be near enough to see, which means that they are in as much danger at times as are the ships of the fighting squadron, far more if one remembers that the former are in no way protected. Some of them are heavy sea-going tugs and others are yachts. The expense of charter, insurance and running cost amounts to from $200 to $400 a day each, and...", "...mental calculations. Then he continued: \"One inch below the top! That is twenty.\" \"Twenty what?\" asked Ralph. \"Twenty feet; the Germans have the English foot on all their boats. I wonder they didn't think about that, and make a change before starting out.\" \"Maybe it's twenty meters,\" said Alfred, with a slight laugh. \"Oh, no,\" replied the captain. \"That would be too Frenchy for the Germans. Besides, it would be too much by all odds. I am sure the conning tower is not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet below the surface of the water.\" \"Then the stern of the submarine must be sticking out of the water,\" remarked Alfred. \"Unquestionably,\" replied the captain. \"How far, do you suppose?\" asked Ralph. \"We can easily figure that out,\" said the captain. \"Let me see; we must first get the angle at which the boat is lying.\" [Illustration: _The Entangled Submarine_] After looking about for some time he continued: \"The door jamb is built in vertically; that is sure. A...", "...England and a stranger in Paris. When I told him I was from America, he exclaimed, \"Ah, that is farther off.\" Then, noticing the passport, which was uncommonly large and was bound like a book, he asked, \"Is that an American passport? Please let me have a look at it I'm curious to see it.\" Bound in with the passport were a number of blank leaves to be used for the vises of various consuls. \"Young man,\" said my chance acquaintance, \"you have leaves enough there to travel about Europe for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years.\" Then he inquired if I was traveling for pleasure or on business. \"I have come over to study music.\" \"Ah, composition?\" \"No; mainly piano, but also theory and composition.\" \"And where?\" \"I expect to go to Leipsic to study with Moscheles, Hauptmann, and Richter.

Just as he was leaving...", "...with the dynamite, you can have it for nothing. On the other hand, if he does blow himself up, you must pay for the dynamite.\" A few days later, there was some hitch in Bender's exceptional luck. A particularly refractory old stump had resisted a couple of Bender's dynamic attacks. The failure to dislodge the stump Bender took as a personal affront, because it reflected upon his skill as a stump-blaster. \"Next time,\" said he, \"something is going to happen.\" He placed about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> pounds of dynamite under the deep-rooted veteran, touched it off, and several things happened in very quick succession. The huge stump let go its hold on earth, and proceeded to hunt Bender. It was a level race, but the stump won. Striking Bender on the north quarter, it stove in four ribs, dislocated a few joints, and damaged him in several other respects and particulars. Boniface came to settle for the dynamite. \"Sixteen cents a pound,\" I said. \"Bender hasn't a chance in a...", "...become one of His Majesty's officers, was sent on detachment to a village at about ten miles' distance.

This news having been brought to Schomberg, he sent a trumpet to the Duke of Berwick, acquainting him that if they went on to burn towns in that barbarous manner, he would give no quarter. This notice seems to have had a good effect, for on quitting Dundalk the retreating army did no harm to the town. Schomberg encamped about a mile north of Dundalk, in a low, moist ground, where he entrenched his army. Count Rosen was then at Drogheda with about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand men, far outnumbering the forces under Schomberg. About the end of September, King James's army approached the lines of Dundalk. They drew up in order of battle. The English officers were for attacking the enemy, but Schomberg advised them to refrain. A large party of horse appeared within cannon shot, but they made no further attempt.

The fish must be caught when they are there to be caught, and they must be split and salted the day they are caught, and then there's the work of spreading them on the \"flakes,\" and turning them, and piling and covering them when rain threatens. A cataract began to form on Uncle Willie's eyes, and every day he could see just a little less plainly than the day before.

In alliance with the Northern Democratic party, the South with these thirty votes might repeal the Civil Rights Bill, the principle of which is embodied in the proposed amendment.

In its habitat, whenever a fish betrays its presence by leaping or flashing its glittering scales in the sun, the Pelican will be seen sailing towards it. This bird has an appetite so insatiable, and a stomach so capacious, that, in one day's fishing, it devours as much fish as would satisfy six men.

Suppose, for illustration, two merchants in the same town are each doing a business with a <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> per cent. profit, and are buying eggs at ten cents and selling for eleven, the cent advance being sufficient to pay for their labor, incidental loss, and a small profit. Now one merchant concludes to play for more trade. If he marks his goods down he would gain some trade, but many people would fear his goods were cheap. But if he puts up a placard, \"Eleven Cents Paid For Eggs,\" the farmers will throng his store and never question the quality of his goods. This move having been...", "...broke.

They stood back some fifty yards from the road, and were that distance from one another. About the centre, on one side of the street, was the chapel, and on the other the school-house. A belt of trees protected the settlement on the sea-side, while inland rose ranges of picturesque mountains, the intervening space being occupied by pastures and fields cultivated or in the course of cultivation. I remember the scene well. It gave...", "...One of the elders of this society, Hewitt Chandler, a man of uncommon mechanical ingenuity, and the inventor of a mowing-machine which was made here for some years, has contrived a way of bending staves without setting them up in the cask, which saves much time and labor, and makes this part of their business additionally profitable. They made last year also a thousand dollars' worth of pickles; and the women make fancy articles in their spare time. They employ from fifteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> laborers in their mills and other works, most of whom are boarded and lodged on the place.

The second family at this place was \"gathered\" in 1808, at Gorham, in Maine, and removed to its present location in 1819.

She had <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> ribs, and would draw less than four feet of water. She was clinker-built; that is, had plates slightly overlapped, like the shingles on the side of a house. The planks and timbers of the frame were fastened together with withes made of roots, but the oaken boards of the side were united by iron rivets firmly clinched. The bow and stern were similar in shape, and must have risen high out of water, but were so broken that it was impossible to tell how they originally ended. The...", "...not worth the paper on which they were printed. \"Let us suppose, my dear sir,\" resumed M.

There is enough to represent my capital a thousand times over.\" And, in a paroxysm of delight, he added: \"Give me enough of these shares to represent a capital of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand francs; and give me some of each kind. I should like my creditors to have a variety.\" Thereupon M. Fortunat counted out a pile of these worthless securities as carefully as if he had been handling bank-notes; and his client at the same time drew out his pocketbook. \"How much do I owe you?\" he inquired. \"Three thousand francs.\" The honest merchant bounded from his chair. \"Three thousand francs!\" he repeated. \"You must be jesting.

Yellow and white were perhaps the most frequent, but there were also bright pinks and purples and violets. Palms rising here and there often high above the rest gave a variety of tint and form, while the space between the trunks was filled by tree-ferns rising to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet and by a bewildering profusion of climbing and hanging and parasitic plants, many of them girdling the boughs with flowers. There were far more than anybody could give me names for, and as I had no means of ascertaining the scientific names, it would not serve the reader to give the popular Portuguese ones, especially as I found that the same name was sometimes applied to quite different plants because their colour was similar.

He ate the cheese first, because it smelt so nice, and then he ate the cake. Away went Archie and Kenneth and Shot. It didn't take them long to gallop through the heather and furze. Of course the furze made their bare knees bleed, but they did not mind that.

It wasn't much of a manse, only an ordinary-looking, blue-slated house of two stories, but it had a nice lawn in front and gardens round it, where ash trees, limes, planes, and elms grew almost in too great abundance. The windows were large, and one was a French one, and opened under a verandah on to the lawn. This was the Rev David Grant's study.

Sometimes in a hard winter we would hear high in the sky the cry of a weird pack of hounds. Nearer and nearer drew that unearthly music, till we held our breath in a kind of delightful terror, and then above our heads appeared a flock of wild swans on the search for water; and down they dropped, like white cannon-balls, into the lake, sending a mass of spray into the air and shivering the...", "...the previous eighteen months, both in public and in private; made the subject of speeches in clubs, published in anti-clerical newspapers--all part of the campaign against the friars, all done to lower their prestige in the eyes of the people, and to obtain their expulsion from the islands.

A list of well-proven cases, say <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty, would have been made up, and submitted to the Government, to whom the Freemasons were clamoring for their expulsion. But, like the stuff the anti-clerical lectures nearer home are made of, the charges were always vague, general, and indefinite.

Presently there came a lull in the tempest, and we began to breathe freer; some one went to the door and opened it. A gust of cold wind swept through the hall and put out the lamp, at which the children and Mary Leighton renewed their cries of fright. The respite in the tempest was but temporary; before the lamp was relit and order restored, the storm had burst again upon us. This was, if anything, fiercer, but shorter lived. After fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes' rage, it subsided almost utterly, and we could hear it taking itself off across the heavens. I suppose the whole storm, from its beginning to its end, had not occupied more than three quarters of an hour, but it had seemed much longer.

The public revenue of Djidda arises almost exclusively from the customs, called here ashour, or tithes.

During the latter period of the sherif\u0092s power, coffee was charged at five dollars the quintal, which may be computed as fifteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> per cent. Spices pay somewhat less than ten per cent.; India piece-goods something more. Great irregularity, therefore, exists in levying the customs; and it is in the power of the officer of customs to favour his friends without incurring any responsibility.

The happy idea of utilising the restless military energies of the Don Kozaks, who were a scourge alike to their Tartar and Russian neighbours, in more thoroughly exploiting the Sibirian country, occurred to the administrators of the Moskovite outpost; an invitation was sent to a band of these freebooters, who had made their own country too hot to hold them, to turn their weapons against the \"infidels\" who were resisting the encroachments of the White-Russian traders....", "...old value of six shillings and eight-pence.

From Sukkur to Jacobabad extends a level tract which, during the rains, is flooded to a depth of seven feet. Between Jacobabad and Dadur--a town situated at the entrance of the Bolan Pass--extends the Sinde desert. Any large force marching across this desert would have to take with them, not only food and forage, but water, for only at intervals of fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles is the parched and barren soil pierced by a few brackish springs, which just suffice for the needs of the hamlets which have sprung up around them. For six months of the year this desert is literally impassable. A hot wind sweeps across it, which is fatal to man and beast. Only once did the Indian Government venture to send troops across it after this \"blast of death\" (as the natives call it) had begun to blow. This was in the last Afghan war.

Near the Cordillera it is composed of a stratified mass of pebbles of all sizes, occasionally including rounded boulders: near its western boundary, it consists of reddish sandy clay, containing some pebbles and numerous fragments of pumice, and sometimes passes into pure sand or into volcanic ashes.

It is an odd sight to see a jovial old Mormon file down the parquette aisle with ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> robust wives at his heels. Yet this spectacle may be witnessed every night the theatre is opened. The dress circle is chiefly occupied by the officers from Camp Douglas and the Gentile Merchants. The upper circles are filled by the private soldiers and Mormon boys. I feel bound to say that a Mormon audience is quite as appreciative as any other kind of an audience.

Leroux and his men carried trading goods and supplies. The first part of the journey was by a route already known. The voyageurs paddled across the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles of water which here forms the breadth of Lake Athabaska, entered a river running from the lake, and followed its {76} winding stream. They encamped at night seven miles from the lake. The next morning at four o'clock the canoes were on their way again, descending the winding river through a low forest of birch and willow. After a paddle of ten miles, a bend in the little river brought the canoes out upon the broad stream of the Peace river, its waters here being upwards...", "...In the second they were vanquished in a bloody battle, with more loss and dishonor than they had sustained since the foundation of their monarchy.

In round figures, four such places might be erected for L500.[3] For a large parish will contain as many as twenty farmers, and some more than that: L500 distributed between twenty is but L25 apiece, and this sum could be still further reduced if the landlords, the clergy, and the principal inhabitants are calculated to take an interest in the matter. Let it be taken at L20 each, and the product four cottages. As there are supposed to be <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> farms, it may be reckoned that eight or ten new cottages would be welcome. This would vary with circumstances. In some places five would be sufficient. Ten would be the very highest number; and may be considered quite exceptional. Now for the repayment of the investment of L20.

From the commander of the British vessel which he boarded, Lord Hastings learned some of the details of the fighting up to date.

Section 3 Holsten, before he died, was destined to see atomic energy dominating every other source of power, but for some years yet a vast network of difficulties in detail and application kept the new discovery from any effective invasion of ordinary life.

The thing, of course, was discussed very much, more perhaps at the time of its discovery than during the interval of technical adaptation, but with very little realisation of the huge economic revolution that impended.

A certain distention of all parts of the body is the beginning of the renewal of energy and a primary manifestation of life.

The chief elements in this primary distention of the body are found in the...", "...but did not speak. So far I had not heard the sounds of their voices, and I have noticed that foreigners on a journey, as a rule, are not more talkative than English people. Two hours later we arrived at Dunaburg, which is a large town and a considerable railway centre. It was crowded by soldiers; and field artillery were entraining in large numbers. Two passengers got out of the carriage here, and six others entered; but when we started again I do not think there were more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> people in the whole train. The population of the country was evidently not fleeing coastwise. We were backed into a siding and kept there six hours. During the night we were more often stationary than moving, and at daybreak on the morning of the 18th were still only crawling along the line.

To each of the mines was a tablet on which was painted \"Avec les assurances de ma plus parfaite consideration--Restronguet, capitan de sous-marin.\" With the fall of the tide, that here exceeds <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet, these disquieting evidences were discovered, and within a few hours Captain Restronguet was the talk of all the cafes of Paris. The French, pioneers in submarine warfare, were now at a loss to explain how a submerged craft could, in broad daylight, enter the breakwater-enclosed harbour and run alongside the caissons of the docks without being discovered, while to deposit three bulky \"mines\" in water of not more than three fathoms in depth was an exploit that required a lot...", "...assured me--whom poverty had driven with his family to inhabit a shepherd's hut above the Restorica on the flank of Monte Rotondo where it looks towards Corte.

Every observation tends to the inference that this now mighty estuary may, centuries hence, be reduced to similar bounds and rules to those which govern the outlets of the Amazons, the Mississippi, the Nile, and the Ganges. Nor will this require, perhaps, so long a period as might at first be imagined.[46] If we except the narrow channel between the Chico and Ortiz banks, below Buenos Ayres, the average depth of the river between that city and Monte Video does not exceed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet. The prodigious quantity of mud and detritus brought down by it is well known,--the whole river, wide as it is, is at times discoloured by it. Now, if but enough of this sediment is deposited to cause the small annual increase of only half an inch in the bed of the river, it will not require 500 years to form a delta, which, in the language of the country, will be nothing more or less than an extension of the existing pampas.

The boys, wildly delighted by this irregular development which gave them such a chance, joined in the chase and in a few seconds it became a chaotic romp like a rat hunt in a schoolroom. The dogs ranged up on each side and were on to the pig together, Jess hanging on to one ear and Jock at the neck; the boar dug right and left at them, but his tusks were short and blunt, and if he managed to get at them at all they bore no mark of it afterwards. For about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> yards they dragged and tugged, and then all three came somersaulting over together. In the scramble Jock got his grip on the throat, and Jess--rolled and trampled on--appeared between the pig's hind legs, sliding on her back with her teeth embedded in one of the hams. For half a minute the boar, grunting and snorting, plunged about madly, trying to get at them or to free himself; and then the boys caught up and riddled him with their assegais.

There were then above 40,000 slaves, and about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> persons were killed before it was quelled. In 1741, there was a formidable insurrection among the slaves in New York. At that time the population consisted of 12,000 whites and 2,000 blacks.

Blackbeard drained a glass of grog, wishing the lieutenant luck in getting aboard of him, fired a broadside, blew some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> of the lieutenant's men out of existence, and totally crippled one of his little sloops for the balance of the fight. After that, and under cover of the smoke, the pirate and his men boarded the other sloop, and then followed a fine old-fashioned hand-to-hand conflict betwixt him and the lieutenant. First they fired their pistols, and then they took to it with cutlasses--right, left, up and down, cut and slash--until the lieutenant's cutlass broke short off at the hilt.

All of them, with the questionable exception of the Springfield tree above referred to, stop, so far as my experience goes, at about twenty-two or twenty-three feet of girth and a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> of spread. Elms of the second class, generally ranging from fourteen to eighteen feet, are comparatively common. The queen of them all is that glorious tree near one of the churches in Springfield.

Sec. XXVI. When two or more shafts are grouped together, their capitals are usually treated as separate, until they come into actual contact. If there be any awkwardness in the junction, it is concealed by the decoration, and one abacus serves, in most cases, for all. The double group, Fig. XXVII., is the simplest possible type of the arrangement. In the richer Northern Gothic groups of eighteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> shafts cluster together, and sometimes the smaller shafts crouch under the capitals of the larger, and hide their heads in the crannies, with small nominal abaci of their own, while the larger shafts carry the serviceable abacus of the whole pier, as in the nave of Rouen. There is, however, evident sacrifice of sound principle in this system, the smaller abaci being of no use. They are the exact contrary of the rude early abacus at Milan, given in Plate XVII.

Of these, 1,000 lived in Gippsland, a patch of territory the size of fifteen or sixteen Rhode Islands: they did not diminish as fast as some of the other communities; indeed, at the end of forty years there were still 200 of them left. The Geelong tribe diminished more satisfactorily: from 173 persons it faded to 34 in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years; at the end of another twenty the tribe numbered one person altogether. The two Melbourne tribes could muster almost 300 when the white man came; they could muster but twenty, thirty-seven years later, in 1875. In that year there were still odds and ends of tribes scattered about the colony of Victoria, but I was told that natives of full blood are very scarce now. It is said that the aboriginals continue in some force in the huge territory called Queensland.

This is one of the most important subjects in the whole round of natural history. The metamorphoses of insects, with which every one is familiar, are generally effected abruptly by a few stages; but the transformations are in reality numerous and gradual, though concealed. A certain ephemerous insect (Chloeon) during its development, moults, as shown by Sir J. Lubbock, above <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> times, and each time undergoes a certain amount of change; and in this case we see the act of metamorphosis performed in a primary and gradual manner. Many insects, and especially certain crustaceans, show us what wonderful changes of structure can be effected during development. Such changes, however, reach their acme in the so-called alternate generations of some of the lower animals. It is, for instance, an astonishing fact that a delicate branching coralline, studded with...", "...with Lime (1). Half a pound of soap; half a pound of soda; quarter of a pound of quick-lime. Cut up the soap and dissolve it in half a gallon of boiling water; pour half a gallon of boiling water over the soda, and enough boiling water over the quick-lime to cover it. The lime must be quick and fresh; if quick, it will bubble up when the hot water is poured over it.

Some few days gone he did bring unto me a piece of wood that had three feet in length, one foot in breadth and one foot in depth, and did desire that it be carved and made into the pillar that you do now behold. Also did he promise certain payment for every cubic inch of wood cut away by the carving thereof. \"Now I did at first weigh the block, and found it truly to contain thirty pounds, whereas the pillar doth now weigh but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> pounds. Of a truth I have therefore cut away one cubic foot (which is to say one-third) of the three cubic feet of the block; but this scholar withal doth hold that payment may not thus be fairly made by weight, since the heart of the block may be heavier, or perchance may be more light, than the outside. How then may I with ease satisfy the scholar as to the quantity of wood that hath been cut away?\" This at first sight looks a difficult question, but it is so absurdly simple...", "...chains and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgments written: This honor have all his saints.\" Psalm cxlix, ver. 6, 7, 8, 9.

On the contrary, there is a rise of fifty feet to the head of the present rapids, and a further rise of twenty feet to the level of Lake Erie. During 1871-2, the bed of the river from Buffalo to Cayuga Creek was thoroughly examined for the purpose of locating piers for railway bridges over the stream. The greatest depth at which they found the rock--just below Black Rock dam--was forty-five feet. Generally the rock was found to be only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> to twenty-five feet below the surface of the water. About five miles above the present Falls there is, in the bottom of the river, a shelf of rock stretching, in nearly a straight line, across the channel to Grand Island, and having, apparently, a perpendicular face about sixteen inches deep. Its presence is indicated by a short but decided curve in the surface of the water above it, the water itself varying in depth from eleven to sixteen feet. The shelf above referred to...", "...of thread. So Sivert and Andresen stood there digging, and talking now and again when they stopped for a rest. Andresen had also somehow or other managed to get hold of a gold piece, a twenty-_Krone_ piece, and Sivert would gladly have had the bright thing himself; but Andresen would not part with it--kept it wrapped up in tissue paper in his chest. Sivert proposed a wrestling match for the money--see who could throw the other; but Andresen would not risk it. Sivert offered to stake <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> _Kroner_ in notes against the gold piece, and do all the digging himself into the bargain if he won; but Andresen took offence at that. \"Ho,\" said he, \"and you'd like to go back home, no doubt, and say I'm no good at working on the land!\" At last they agreed to set twenty-five _Kroner_ in notes against the gold twenty-_Krone_ piece, and Sivert slipped home to Sellanraa that night to ask his father for the money.

It was very shabby of them, therefore, to give some of his best parts to younger actors. Betterton was disgusted, and determined to set up for himself, to which end he managed to procure another patent, turned the Queen's Court in Portugal Row, Lincoln's Inn, into a theatre, and opened it on the 30th of April, 1695. The building had been before used as a theatre in the days of the Merry Monarch, and Tom Killegrew had acted here some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years before; but it had again become a 'tennis-quatre of the lesser sort,' says Cibber, and the new theatre was not very grand in fabric. But Betterton drew to it all the best actors and actresses of his former company; and Mrs. Barry and Mrs. Bracegirdle remained true to the old man. Congreve, to his honour, espoused the same cause, and the theatre opened with his play of 'Love for Love,' which was more successful than either of the former. The veteran himself spoke the...", "...DR. MORRIS: Yes, pecans are hickories. The Indians gave it the name of pekan.

Those are the best trees to work with. If we cut off the limbs of a very old tree and try to top work it, it means an enormous amount of work on the part of the orchardist, more work than my employees like to give it.

There were only windmills in that country; you may easily believe how they all began to go. B-r-r-r-r-r! What a noise they made! The clatter was so great that all the birds flew away to other climes, and even the clouds fled from the sky. At the call of Mother Mitchel all the farmers' wives were set to work; they...", "...done,\" said Armine, unwillingly. \"You'll have a terrible time to wait, unless I meet some one first. I'll be as quick as I can.\" \"Not too quick till you get off this place,\" said Jock, \"or you'll be down too, and here, help me off with this boot first.\" This was not done quickly or easily. Jock was almost sick with the pain of the effort, and the bruise looked serious. Armine tried to make him comfortable, and set out, as he thought, in the right direction, but he had hardly gone <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> steps before he came to a sudden standstill with an emphatic \"I say!\" then came back repeating \"I say, Jock, we are close upon the glacier; I was as near as possible going down into an awful blue crack!\" \"That's why it's getting so cold,\" said Jock. \"Here, Chick, come and warm me. Well, Armie, why ain't you off?\" \"Yes,\" said Armine, with a quiver in his voice, \"if I keep down by the side of the glacier, I suppose I must come to the Daubensee in time.\" \"What!

Corinne suspected that Nancy had not been repaid; but nobody else really knew anything about it--not even Jennie. Nancy would not talk about it when some of the girls became curious. She had not needed the money for anything. At New Year's Mr. Gordon had sent her a ten-dollar note, but through Madame Schakael. When she asked him if she could go home with Jennie Bruce over Easter, he sent her at once another <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> dollars and his permission--the latter just as short as it could be written. Scorch evidently watched the mail basket on Mr. Gordon's desk with the eye of an eagle. A second letter with the card of the law firm upon it was put into Nancy's hand almost in the same mail with Mr. Gordon's letter. Such letters passed through the Madame's hands without being opened. It was a secret that troubled Nancy sometimes; yet she could not \"give Scorch away.\" This was Scorch's letter:...", "...to trample it out. I tore at the ground in desperation, hoping to make a bare spot which the flame could not leap. I trampled the fire with my bare feet. I beat at it with my hat. I screamed for help.--Too late I thought of my team and the plow with which I might have drawn a furrow around the stacks. The flame touched the high-piled sheaves. It ran lightly, beautifully up the sides--and as I stood watching it, I thought, \"It is all a dream. It can't be true.\" But it was. In less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes the towering piles had melted into four glowing heaps of ashes. Four hundred dollars had gone up in that blaze. Slowly, painfully I hobbled to the plow and drove my team to the house. Although badly burned, my mental suffering was so much greater that I felt only part of it.--Leaving the horses at the well I hobbled into the house to my mother. She, I knew, would sympathize with me and shield me from the just wrath of my father who was away, but was due to return in...", "...or two, breathing their last in peace and comfort. An elderly man, quite pulseless when brought in, was resuscitated with brandy sufficiently to express his gratitude. \"God has been very good in bringing me here,\" he said, as a beam of joy irradiated his wan face; \"I can die willingly here, and lay my bones under the old flag, but I didn't want to die down there.\" And when asked if he had kept his faith in God while suffering so much at Andersonville: \"O yes! He has been my leader these <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years, and I thought He would bring me out all right.\" His name was John Buttery; he did not live long enough to hear from his wife and six children, in Connecticut. Among the unknown was a boy apparently about seventeen years old, with clustering curls of auburn hair, and eyes, that once must have been full of life, now sending forth only a vacant stare. I worked over him, hoping to get him to utter one word before he died that would give some hint of his name or home, but...", "...garden to write about! That area might do for a tennis-court or for a general meeting of Mr. Frederic Harrison's persuasion. You might kennel a pack of hounds there, or beat a carpet, or assemble those members of the cultured class who admire Mr. Gladstone.

Nevertheless I affirm that I have done all these things, and I shall even venture to make other demands upon the public credulity.

One monk, a youth <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years of age, named Tsering Tundup, is one of the Tibetans whom I think of with particularly kind and warm feeling. His mother also lived in the monastery, and looked after the sheep and goats when they were driven in the evening into the penfolds.

This is the peak that is seen from the floor of the Central Valley and from that distance it appears as if the smoke were issuing from it. As Gumprecht and I neared the apex, he was overcome by sulphur fumes which issued from holes all about us, and was obliged to lie down. I tried the ascent alone, and it took me nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes to climb twenty meters, an average of approximately six feet to the minute. This slowness was due to the slippery dampness of the ground which was here covered with a greenish mold caused by its constant wetting by the steam. This ground was so hot that it was nearly impossible to touch it with the hands and the intensity of the heat soon made itself felt through the soles of my shoes. I was obliged to crawl from rock to rock. Eventually I arrived at a sort of natural...", "...o'clock, which continued through the night and brought the tired, suffering men gracious relief. Grant decided to assault the whole Confederate front and gave his orders for the attack at the first streak of dawn at four-thirty.

Nothing like it had ever before been seen in the history of war. _Ten thousand men in blue fell in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes!_ The battle was practically over at half past seven o'clock. General Smith received an order from Meade to renew the assault and flatly refused. The scene which followed has no parallel in the records of human suffering. Its horror is inconceivable and unthinkable. Through the summer nights the shrieks and groans of the wounded and dying rose in pitiful endless waves. And no hand was lifted to save. For three days they lay begging for water, groaning and dying...", "...a set of plates and a platen press and--\" Larry interrupted, \"Where does he get the plates?\" \"That doesn't matter now,\" Steve said. \"Various ways.

The morning was calm, bright, and clear, and opposite our right, as the sun rose, the scene in front of our line was the most peaceful imaginable. Away to the right were Guinchy, with its brickfields and the ruins of Givenchy.

Save me!\" he cried. \"The serpent is coming; I can hear it splashing the water.\" \"Take the paddle,\" shouted Guy, \"and steer for the island.

His companions encouraged him with cheering words as he came nearer. The island was barely <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> yards distant when the paddle slipped from his grasp. He turned round, apparently to pick up another, and then threw himself with a dismal cry to the bottom of the canoe. The cause of his new and sudden fright was readily seen. On the edge of the gloom, not many yards beyond the canoe, a violent agitation of the water was visible. There undoubtedly was another large serpent in pursuit, and at that moment it looked very much as though Sir Arthur was doomed. In spite of all...", "...the inside with salt and pepper.

By the aid of strips of bark for rope, the stems of bamboos for rafters, and the large leaf of the banana for a thatch, the Tahitians in a few minutes built us an excellent house; and with withered leaves made a soft bed. (PLATE 86. FATAHUA FALL, TAHITI.) (PLATE 87. TAHITIAN.) They then proceeded to make a fire, and cook our evening meal. A light was procured by rubbing a blunt pointed stick in a groove...", "...this time, beautifully turned hexameters with a certain Lucretian cadence, it is clear that his mind was like Pico's, hovering about the borderland of human knowledge, clutching at the eternally evasive. Plato's Banquet was his gospel, where the quest of truth did not lack the warmth of desire.

He was the perfect scholar who had toiled at books and not less at the study of mankind. But his well-knit body and clear eyes showed no marks of bookishness, and Italy had made him a swordsman.

But he was more aloof than ever. There was little warmth in...", "...The baron failed to grasp the purport of the look. After lunch he had the prince carefully cleaned, and then set him in an easy chair under his eye, to await the coming of his august sire, who would arrive about a quarter to three. Then he walked up and down the room working out the most effective presentation of his indictment of Pollyooly and the social entanglement. At intervals he gesticulated and muttered a phrase. He was making excellent progress with it and at five and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes to three he was at the end of it. The prince sat stolidly in the easy chair by the long windows. At twenty-four minutes to three the baron flung out the last damning phrase (with the appropriate splendid gesture) at his image in the looking-glass over the mantelpiece. Then he turned to beam triumphantly on his little charge. The easy chair was empty; the prince had gone. With language far less sonorous, but more staccato, the baron bounced to the window, just in...", "...beneficent laws. The development of taste is more than the acquisition of information; the inspiration of literature, history, art, and descriptive science is far more valuable than drill beyond the essentials in grammar, geography, and arithmetic. Plato's programme for the years from seventeen to twenty, three of our four college years, is even more startling and heretical; and quite in line with certain tendencies in our own day. He would set apart the three years from seventeen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> for gymnastic exercises, including in such exercises, however, military drill. Plato appreciated both the advantage and disadvantage of intense athletic exercises. \"The period, whether of two or three years, which passes in this sort of training is useless for any other purpose,--for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning; and the trial is one of the most important tests to which they are subjected.\" At the age of twenty he would select the most promising youths and...", "...that we saw a few minutes ago, built like an automobile engine and having the same gritty driving power.

It began <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years ago as a single train of moderate length--about seven or eight Pullman cars and a diner. To-day it almost always consists of at least two sections, each of ten to twelve heavy steel diners and Pullman sleepers. In figures, the weight increase is close to 216 per cent. The train easily might make the run through to Chicago in eighteen hours as it did at the outset if safety and other conditions permitted. The energy of the locomotive is not the limiting factor.

I began the bead-work, and Jeannette was laughing at my mistakes, when the door opened, and our surgeon came in, pausing to warm his hands before going up to his room in the attic. A taciturn man was our surgeon, Rodney Prescott, not popular in the merry garrison circle, but a favorite of mine; the Puritan, the New-Englander, the Bostonian, were as plainly written upon his face as the French and Indian were...", "...it I saw a room identical with that at the other corner; and here were Colonel Sampson, Wright, and several other men, all smoking and talking. It might have been interesting to tarry there within ear-shot, but I wanted to get back to the road to intercept Steele.

He came on slowly, looking all around, halted some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> paces distant, surveyed the house, then evidently espying me, came on again. My first feeling was, What a giant! But his face was hidden in the shadow of a sombrero. I had intended, of course, upon first sight to blurt out my identity. Yet I did not. He affected me strangely, or perhaps it was my emotion at the thought that we Rangers, with so much in common and at stake, had come together. \"Is Sampson at home?\" he asked abruptly. I said, \"Yes.\" \"Ask him if he'll...", "...she would have imposed on the most experienced sharpers.

Now, however, a new motive was provided--that of discovering the uses to the organism of its various colours, structures, and habits, and the application of the principle of natural selection to show how these characters conduced to the preservation and further evolution of the species. And out of this interest in the theory of natural selection grew in the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years of the nineteenth century the greatly increased attention to the facts and theories of heredity, which was stimulated by Darwin's hypothesis of Pangenesis and especially by Weismann's speculations about the nature and behaviour of the 'germ-plasm'.

There were sixteen of them in all, for the most part upper classmen who had failed to make the varsity the year before, with a sprinkling of sophomores and two freshmen. The freshmen were Jack and a small, wiry chap, named Clover, who was trying for shortstop. Bissell led the way to the batting nets and soon they were hard at work. A third squad, made up of some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> more or less hopeless candidates, many of them freshmen who would later form the nucleus of their class nine, were occupying an improvised diamond at the farther end of the football field.

Jansen's pupil at Port Royal from A.D. 1635, Duvergier de Hauranne, usually called St. Cyran, from the Benedictine monastery of which he was abbot, was the bitter foe of the Jesuits and Richelieu, who had him cast into prison in A.D. 1638, from which he was liberated after the death of the cardinal in A.D. 1643, and shortly before his own. Another distinguished member of the party was Antoine Arnauld, doctor of the Sorbonne, who died in A.D. 1694, the youngest of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> children of a parliamentary advocate, whose powerful defence of the University of Paris against the Jesuits called forth their hatred and lifelong persecution. His mantle, as a vigorous polemist, had fallen upon his youngest son.

The Waraus of Guiana employ fire for excavating their canoes; and when Columbus discovered the Island of Guanahani or San Salvador, in the West Indies, he found [fire] employed for this purpose by the natives, who called their boats '_canoe_', a term which has ever since been employed by Europeans to express this most primitive class of vessel.

The inefficient transmission of letters some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years ago in London provoked an effort to supplement it by a service of private messengers. The post-office authorities were instantly up in arms, ready to nip this enterprise in the bud, and forcibly prevent any other human being from doing what they were still, to all appearance, determined not to do themselves.[11] Then, as a grudging concession, permission to transmit letters with a promptitude which the post-office still declined to emulate was accorded to a company on...", "...matter.

But what I do mean is just this: the average young fellow I have described can get into a staunch sail-boat and put out across the ocean, without knowing anything about navigation, and at the end of the week he will know enough to know where he is on the chart.

That the contents of the cells of the glands, and afterwards those of the pedicels, are affected in a plainly visible manner by the pressure of minute particles, we shall have abundant evidence when we treat of the aggregation of protoplasm. But the case is much more remarkable than as yet stated; for the particles are supported by the viscid and dense secretion;...", "...to dwelling houses, and the town became more compact. Twelve or more servants were necessary for the maintenance of large establishments, varying in number according to the size of the family and the house. There was generally a butler, who acted as major-domo, a cook and kitchenmaid, body servants or valets for the head of the house and the young gentlemen, a ladies' maid, chambermaid, nurse and nursemaids, a coachman, stable boy, gardener, yard boy and laundress. During the first <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years of the city's development, an entire block might contain not more than four homes. Each of these units functioned as a miniature and self-supporting estate, surrounded by flower and vegetable gardens and the usual outbuildings--necessaries, kitchen, dairy, ice house, smokehouse, fowl house, servant quarters and stable. The following advertisement appearing as late as 1828 illustrates the traditional layout: TO LET An elegant two story Brick House, with...", "...namely, of the children of Ephraim, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 1:33 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred. 1:34 Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 1:35 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Manasseh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred. 1:36 Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 1:37 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Benjamin, were...", "...ford, whom should they see resting under the shade of the trees but Harry Musgrave and young Christie? Harry's attitude was somewhat weary. He leant on one elbow, recumbent upon the turf, and with flat pebbles dexterously thrown made ducks and drakes upon the surface of the shallow pool where the cattle drank. Young Christie was talking with much earnestness--propounding some argument apparently--and neither observed the approach of Mr. Carnegie and his companion until they were within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> paces. Then a sudden flush overspread Harry's face. \"It _is_ Bessie Fairfax!\" said he, and sprang to his feet and advanced to meet her. Bessie was rosy too, and her eyes dewy bright. Young Christie, viewing her as an artist, called her to himself the sweetest and most womanly of women, and admired her the more for her kind looks at his friend. Harry's _ennui_ was quite routed. \"We were walking to Brook--your mother will give us a cup of tea, Harry?\" said Mr. Carnegie. Harry...", "...round Hudson's Bay, now called Rupert's Land, having powers like those of the feudal lords of an earlier time--\"to employ ships of war, to erect forts, to make reprisals, to send home English traders who neglected their licenses, and to declare war or make peace with any people not Christian.\" Although the Declaration of Rights in 1689 limited the rights granted by exclusive charters, and allowed British subjects to trade freely to any quarter, yet the Hudson's Bay Company had in the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years previous to that date obtained such a hold upon the new territory, especially by the erection of forts, that they easily left all competitors behind. The spirit of discovery was never so alive among the French as during those years following the expulsion of Radisson and Groseilliers; yet the Government in Quebec was slow to realise the serious nature of the menace in the north; and from the official papers afterwards prepared for the British delegates at Utrecht, their...", "...first visit. Now I am used to Feiwel Silbermann's quirks and sallies. I know his intentions are not bad; and then his great merit in my eyes is his rare fidelity to Simon Eichelkatz. After I had finished examining the patient on my first visit, Feiwel crept after me, caught hold of me as I stood on the lowest step, and anxiously inquired: \"What is the matter with Reb Shimme? Is he, God forbid, really sick? He's never been this way before.

I have undertaken to play valet de place this afternoon. They were to have met me here at two o'clock, and I have been waiting for them <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes.

I don't know whether to be furious at their playing me false, or delighted to have escaped them.\" \"I think in your place I would be furious,\" said Newman, \"because they may arrive yet, and then your fury will still be of use to you.

Tell us about it, Mr. Crawford.\" \"Why, Yetmore rode in yesterday afternoon, as I told you, on his way to town--he said. But I rather suspected the truth of his statement. He had come in a desperate hurry, for his horse was in a lather, and if he was in such haste to get to town, why did he waste time talking to me, as he did for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes? But when, just as he was starting off again, he turned back and asked me if I wanted to sell my share in the drill and claim, I knew that that was what he had come about, and I had a strong suspicion that he had heard of a strike of some sort and was trying to get the better of me. So when he asked what I wanted for my share, I said I would take his thirty acres, and in spite of his protestations that I was asking far too much, I stuck to it. The final result was that I...", "...git used to livin'in a coffin afore he needs one,\" &c.

The colours were of the right sort, and corresponded exactly with those that glittered upon the skin of the captive warrior. Under the keen edge of a bowie, my moustaches came off in a twinkling: a little grease was procured; the paints were mixed; and placing myself side by side with the Indian, I stood for _his_ portrait.

Facing to the south, Esteban looked up the full length of the valley of the San Juan, clear to the majestic Pan de Matanzas, a wonderful sight indeed; then his eyes returned, as they always did, to the Yumuri, Valley of Delight. \"Paradise indeed!\" he muttered. \"I gave her everything. She gained nothing by dying.\" With a grave thoughtfulness which proved him superior to the ordinary slave, Sebastian replied: \"True!...", "...no word touching her.\" \"Ah, friends!\" said Mr Marshall with a sigh, \"let me ensure you that England's mourning is not yet over for Queen Elizabeth, and we may live to lament our loss of her far sorer than now we do.

It was not until a month had elapsed that the authorities of Antwerp sent their propositions to the Prince of Parma.

Allowing for the different kinds of work that could be done simultaneously, he made out a total of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> days. \"Well, that's all right, I guess,\" said Pete, \"but you see that takes us way along into next year sometime.\" \"About March first,\" said Max. \"You haven't divided by three yet,\" said Bannon. \"We'll get three eight-hour days into every twenty-four hours, and twenty-one of 'em into every week.\" \"Why, that's better than we need to do,\" said Pete, after a moment. \"That gets us about two weeks ahead of time.\" \"Did you ever get through when you thought you would?\"...", "...\"Yes, I am certain they are coming,\" he said, after listening for two or three minutes. \"We have got two or three torches left, and I will give them the benefit of them.\" He went back to the embers of the fire, lighted the torches, and, returning to the barrier, threw them twenty or thirty yards up the ravine. There was a hoarse shout of anger, and then a dozen shots were fired. Bertie's rifle cracked out in return, and Harry's followed almost immediately. A dark group of some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty men were rushing forward, and had just reached the line where the torches were burning, when four barrels of buck-shot were poured into them. Three or four fell, the rest fled at once, and the cries and oaths showed that many of them were wounded. \"They won't venture again for the present,\" Harry said. \"You may be sure they will hold a council of war, so load again and then we will be off.\" Two minutes later they were making their way carefully down the rocky...", "...with blindness, and filled with trouble. 10:31.

But the curtailing of the chief sermon may easily be overdone. People will never venture to complain of the shortness of a sermon, but in truth one of eight or ten minutes does not satisfy them, nor allow time to develop the matter properly. It may be admitted, however, that shortness is a fault on the right side, and people would not now tolerate the length of sermon that used to be imposed on them. As a general rule, it would be well to be under <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes rather than over, unless the occasion be an important one, with a special preacher, who may allow himself longer. This applies to the chief sermons only; that at the evening service on a weekday, or at Holy Family or Confraternity meetings or the like would naturally be shorter; eight or ten minutes might in many cases be enough.

His words, in fact, were all-powerful with the multitude. He had all that was wanted to act upon them at a given moment: a strong voice, an inflated eloquence, and a fearless heart. While M.

He did not play for very large sums, it is true; seldom more than five to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> dollars; and it was his uniform practice to retire precisely at nine o'clock, and without supper.

A loss of at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand had been inflicted on the Federal armies, while the loss of the Confederate army had not been over one-third of that number. In addition to that, the immense stores gathered and taken South were of inestimable value to the army.

Black poplar wood and willow offer a moderate resistance: a few revolutions suffice to penetrate them. In all instances the susceptibility of the wood depends on the sap.

Lieutenant Edward Longcroft, of the radeau _Thunderer_, not being able to get his raft into action, went with a boat's crew on board the _Royal Savage_, and for a time turned her guns upon her former friends; but the fire of the latter forced him again to abandon her, and it seemed so likely that she...", "...will listen with veneration to the recital of your noble deeds: you may proudly say, I too was in that grand army which twice entered the walls of Vienna, and those of Rome, of Berlin, of Madrid, and of Moscow, and which cleansed Paris from the stain inflicted on it by treason and the presence of the enemy.

I therefore clung pretty closely to my argumentative German acquaintance of Bentheim and Aix. During the melee of changing cars I was, however, separated from him, and became engaged in conversation (spoken in English) with a Dutch chocolate merchant. The argument must have been interesting, for I did not at first notice a crowd of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty travelers and villagers gathering around us: I did, however, notice when they began to push and jostle in a manner obviously intended for insult. When I tried to retreat the exits were locked. The crowd, convinced that I was an English spy, closed more compactly and manhandled me off toward an officer on the street behind the platform. My hat was knocked off, and for a brief moment I recalled the lynching anger which I had seen in the eyes of Belgian mobs, as German...", "...Dr. Mosgrave listened as quietly as he had listened before. Robert concluded with an earnest appeal to the physician's best feelings. He implored him to spare the generous old man whose fatal confidence in a wicked woman had brought much misery upon his declining years. It was impossible to draw any conclusion, either favorable or otherwise, from Dr. Mosgrave's attentive face. He rose, when Robert had finished speaking, and looked at his watch once more. \"I can only spare you <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes,\" he said. \"I will see the lady, if you please. You say her mother died in a madhouse?\" \"She did. Will you see Lady Audley alone?\" \"Yes, alone, if you please.\" Robert rung for my lady's maid, and under convoy of that smart young damsel the physician found his way to the octagon antechamber, and the fairy boudoir with which it communicated. Ten minutes afterward, he returned to the library, in which Robert sat waiting for him. \"I have talked to the lady,\" he...", "...boy, we'll camp here.\" It was a fearful spot.

We have seen this result produced without any other agency except the use of ice, in perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> cases of sore throat within a few weeks. We have seen it take effect at an advanced stage of chronic disease, and raise a person up apparently from death's door. It seems a somewhat heroic method of treatment when a person is suffering in body to apply a castigation to the character through the spiritual or moral part; but this is precisely the thing needed to cleanse and purify the system from disease. We have tried it, and found it to be invaluable. To all who have faith in...", "...never died. In 1880, when Grant's mistaken friends tried to nominate him for a third Presidential term, other candidates had been urged because this one, it was said, could carry Ohio, that one Maine, and so on. Then Roscoe Conkling of New York strode upon the stage to nominate Grant and declaimed to a hushed audience of twenty thousand men: \"And if you ask what State he comes from, Our sole reply shall be: HE comes from Appomattox And the famous apple tree!\" The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand were swept off their feet by the magic of that myth. Grant was almost nominated--but not quite. The historic interview began in the room to the left of the front door in the McLean house. Two very different figures confronted each other.

He writes: \"I was without a sword, as I usually was when on horseback in the field, and wore a...", "...to remain rooted to the spot. A blinding, circular sweep of lightning blazed through the windows of the pavilion, illumining it from end to end with a brilliant blue glare, accompanied by a deafening crash and terrific peal of thunder which shook the very earth beneath.

From <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> different parts of the great hall it seemed at once to spring aloft in spiral coils. With a wild cry of terror those of the revellers who had not outright been struck dead by the fiery bolt, rushed towards the doors, clambering in frenzied fear over the dead, trampling on the scorched disfigured faces of the dancing girls, on whose graceful pantomime they had feasted their eyes so short a time ago. There was no safety in the pavilion, which a moment had transformed into a...", "...they were taking a more modest pace, and Mr. Masterson began turning in the corners, and closing up the flanks, of the retreating band. He made no effort to crowd or press, but gave them every encouragement to regain their confidence, and moderate their flight. Presently the herd was jogging comfortably; and because the wind was in their faces they were furnished no disquieting notice of Mr. Masterson's paleface identity through the medium of their noses. The ponies had traveled <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes, and were cleverly bunched, when Mr. Masterson made a discovery. Off to the right in the dull half-dark he beheld a figure, blanketed, mounted, riding like the wind, and busy with the stragglers as they pointed out of the herd. Like a flash, Mr. Masterson whipped his rifle from its scabbard. Throwing the blanket aside, to free his hands and arms, he fell a trifle to the rear, and began edging towards the stranger.

He set out all the faults and absurdities he could see in Wagner. The Wagnerians at once credited him with a grotesque jealousy of their God. Christophe for his part had no doubt that these same people who exalted Wagner since he was dead would have been the first to strangle him in his life: and he did them an injustice. The Klings and the Laubers also had had their hour of illumination: they had been advanced <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years ago: and then like most people they had stopped short at that. Man has so little force that he is out of breath after the first ascent: very few are long-winded enough to go on. Christophe's attitude quickly alienated him from his new friends. Their sympathy was a bargain: he had to side with them if they were to side with him: and it was quite evident that Christophe would not yield an inch: he would not join them. They lost their enthusiasm for him.

It is accompanied by thunder that sounds hollow, that rumbles over the sky, and usually does not end with the crash and thud of the more vigorous variety.

I have known such a storm to manifest itself low in the west, approach, and break within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes. Much wind results and not much rain, although the temperature falls. Lightning with storms of this impromptu kind rarely does any damage. But if the storm rises slowly against the wind, requiring an hour or two or three to approach and break, the lightning will grow almost continuously, some of the flashes being broad streamers cleaving the western sky. It is this sort of lightning that does the damage. The thunder, instead of rolling like an empty barrel, hits into a...", "...Ibrahim and his party, and recounted the affair of mutiny.

His immense wagon train, more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles long and the flank of his army were exposed, and with impunity by this movement.

All these provisions were continually neglected. It was no uncommon thing for councillors to obtain patents for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty thousand acres, and sometimes they owned as much as sixty thousand acres. They neglected frequently to erect houses on these estates, or, if they wished to keep within the limits of the law, they built but slight shanties, so small and ill constructed that no human being could inhabit them.

Tom and Jerry were as popular <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years since as Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller now are; and often have we wished, while reading the biographies of the latter celebrated personages, that they had been described as well by Mr. Cruikshank's pencil as by Mr. Dickens's pen.

This involved a second half-hour of hard work by all hands, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes later three more locks close together blocked the way. It was foolish to persevere in dragging the boat around locks all night long; so, after getting her out of the canal on the side opposite to the tow-path, the boys dragged her behind some bushes, where the canal boatmen could not see her at daylight.

Peter and his <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> had for breakfast besides side-dishes, half a sheep, half a lamb, ten pullets, a dozen chickens, seven dozen eggs and something over a quart apiece of mulled wine, with a gallon or so of brandy. Dinner was a better meal; three stone of ribs of beef was the main dish, with a sheep, a lamb, and a couple of joints of veal to help it out; capons and rabbits tempted the jaded, and four dozen of sack and wine made up for what was lacking at breakfast.

Some of them will not be received with full credit by readers. In the infirmary at Houston was a boy whose name is Rutter. He was found on Monday morning lying behind a trunk on the land near the town of Hitchcock, which is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> miles to the northward of Galveston. The boy was only 12 years old. His story was that his father, mother, and two children remained in the house. There was a crash. The house went to pieces. The boy said he caught hold of a trunk when he found himself in the water and floated off with it. He was sure the others were drowned. He had no idea of where it took him, but when daylight came he was across the bay and out upon the still partially submerged mainland.

Between these it passed like a narrow lane, the huge prisms rising on each side of it, piled up in a regular trap-like formation, as if placed there by the hand of man! The latter hypothesis was out of the question. Many of the blocks were a dozen feet in diameter, and tons in weight. Titans alone could have lifted them! The summit itself was a table of some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> by forty feet in superficial extent, and seamed by several fissures.

His request was not allowed. We discussed at some length the probable result. These are my views and arguments. I said to him, 'When I saw your boats coming out I should have steamed away. Now the speed of my frigate is thirteen knots. You would probably have had a speed of nineteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> at most. Thus your rate of approaching me would have been six knots, no great speed with which to approach a vessel armed with Nordenfelt guns, and six other guns also, _en barbette_, firing grape, shell, &c. I am convinced we should have destroyed all the torpedo boats.' 'Well, then,' said the Russian officer, 'I should have followed and attacked you during the night.' 'There again,' I said, 'I think you would have failed, because before dark you could not have got near enough...", "...2600 pounds. The draw-bar pull per ton of load varies from the minimum of 50 pounds on a level pavement to 250 pounds on a level dirt road, depending upon the character of surface.[5] Twenty pounds of additional pull are required for each degree of gradient. For example, a fore and aft plank road offers a resistance of about 60 pounds pull to a ton of load. If this were located on a seven per cent grade, it would require a 60 pound pull to overcome the load resistance plus seven times <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or 140 pounds additional pull for the grade, a total of 200 pounds to pull one ton. Dividing 2600, the draw-bar pull of the truck, by 200, the resistance offered by road and grade, gives 13 tons as the load that can be pulled by the truck over this surface and grade. As this must include the weight of the trailer, which when equipped for logging is about three tons, it leaves a total of 10 tons that the truck can pull. This is equivalent to about 3000 feet B.

But in the evening it pleased the Lord to show me something of the awful nearness...", "...and had wiped her fingers upon the smiling plumpness there. At any rate, as sure as ever I betook me to the window, there would be Christian's Elsa, busy with her needles. And to tell truth I misliked it not greatly. Why, indeed, should I? For there is surely no harm in looking across twenty yards of space at a maid, and as little in the maid looking at you--that is, if neither of you come any nearer. Besides, it is much pleasanter to look at a pretty lass than at a vacant wall and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> yards of uneven cobble-stones. Now the girl was harmless enough--a red and white maid, plump as a partridge in the end of harvest. She was forever humming at songs, singing little choruses, and inventing of new melodies, all tunefully and prettily enough. And she would bring her dulcimer to the window and play them over, nodding her head to the instrument as she sang. It was pleasant to watch her. For sometimes when the music refused to run aright, she would frown at the...", "...it was, we had no time to act upon it. The tunnel-mouth which had caused Alan's apprehension was about a hundred feet away. It was a ten-foot, yawning hole in the cliff. Perhaps Alan sensed a movement in there. As I turned to look at it a great, hairy human arm came out of the opening! Then a shoulder! A head! The giant figure of a man came squeezing through the hole on his hands and knees! He gathered himself, and as he stood erect, I saw that he was growing in size! Already he was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet tall compared to us--a thick-set fellow, dressed in leather garments, his legs and arms heavily matted with black hair. He stood swaying, gazing around him. I stared up at his round bullet head, his villainous face. He saw us! Stupid amazement struck him, then comprehension. He let out a roar and came at us!

The coats of the intestines are analogous to those of the stomach, and are, in fact, only extensions of them. For convenience of description, the intestines may be divided into the _small_ and the _large_. The small intestine is from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> to twenty-five feet in length, and consists of the Duodenum, Jejunum, and Ileum. The _Duodenum_, so called because its length is equal to the breadth of twelve fingers, is the first division of the small intestine. If the mucous membrane of the duodenum be examined, it will be found thrown into numerous folds, which are called _valvulae conniventes_, the chief function of which appears to be to retard the course of the alimentary matter, and afford a larger surface for the...", "...crumbs, the crackers being nicer if freshly toasted and rolled hot; two large spoonfuls of butter; one teaspoonful of salt; half a teaspoonful of pepper; one saltspoonful of mace.

When he closed, as many as <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> cried out, \"Now let Miss Fiske preach.\" So he withdrew, and left her to their tender mercies. Her preaching was soon finished. She simply told them, that when she knew their language better, she would come and talk with them, but she could not talk at the same time that they did, for God had given her a very small voice, and her words would no more mingle with theirs than oil and water. They said, \"Oil and water never mix; but we will be silent if you will come and preach.\"...", "...entangled in unknitted wool that the only way she could disentangle herself was by coming up to town to continue there with proper help the preparation of mittens against the winter cold. \"Not that it will be necessary,\" everybody said, \"but it's as well to be prepared, and of course it _might_ drag on till the spring.\" The dowager, who had been worked up by her sister to feel that even though she had given a son to England she was still in debt, and Bella were among the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> ladies collected by Lady Jane to make mittens, and the spinster was anxious to add Dorothy to her flock, for what between wool and ladies she was become very pastoral.

Such motor transport units are not often captured or destroyed since they seldom come in touch with anything but the enemy's cavalry which, as a rule, prefers to leave them strictly alone, as a train of motor trucks has good defensive ability and none of the vulnerability of horse-drawn wagons. In the rare cases when actions have taken place, motor trucks have become moving forts, which continue on their way at a rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or twenty-five miles an hour, while from each one three or four well-protected riflemen keep up a steady fire.

At every step the sliding sand carried him about ten feet further, so that each step was equal to about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> feet. It was like flying. But it was attended by so many falls that the descent of Buttons and Dick was accomplished as much by sliding and rolling as by walking. The Senator was more cautious.

That idea is the liberty of all, limited by the like liberty of each. To-night we are here to bow to conscience, not to caste. Susan B. Anthony, the heroine of the hour, sustained by such brave souls as crowd this platform, who for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years have worked without fear and without reproach, deserves the thanks of millions yet to be, for she is the hero, the champion of the same idea for which Abraham Lincoln and half a million soldiers died. The emancipation of man was the proposition. The enfranchisement of woman was not the corollary to that proposition, but the major premise. John Stuart Mill, in his great book, \"The Subjection of Women,\" denies the superior mental...", "...and here am I, a sober man and out of debt.\" \"Though still very far from the advanced position in the world you held a few years ago, and to which you can never more attain,\" said a desponding voice within him. \"A man never has but one chance for attaining ease and competence in this life. If he neglects that, he need not waste his time in any useless struggles.\" \"Time, Faith, Energy!\" spoke out another voice. \"If one year has done so much for you, what will not five, ten, or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years do? Redouble your energies, have confidence in the future, and time will make all right.\" \"I will have faith in time; I will have energy!\" responded the man in Gordon, speaking aloud. From that time Gordon and his wife lived with even stricter economy than before, in order to lay by a little money with which he could,--at some future time, re-commence his own business, which was profitable. There was still only a single shop in town, and that was the one owned by his...", "...poured down, at the same time, such a torrent of missiles on their heads as soon strewed the ditch with mangled limbs and carcasses. At this moment a party, sallying from the fort, fell on the enemy with great slaughter, and drove them--such as were in condition to fly--back into their trenches. The engagement, brought on, as we have seen, by accident, lasted several hours. The loss of the Turks greatly exceeded that of the garrison, which amounted to less than a hundred men, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> of whom were members of the order. But the greatest loss of the besieged was that of the counterscarp and ravelin. Thus shorn of its outworks, the castle of St. Elmo stood like some bare and solitary trunk exposed to all the fury of the tempest.[1312] The loss of the ravelin gave the deepest concern to La Valette, which was not mitigated by the consideration that it was to be charged, in part at least, on the negligence of its defenders. It made him the more solicitous to...", "...rose on every side; long promontories reached out from the shore, varied by bold headlands; and so broken and varied was that floor that the Rabbi was pleased to call it the Aegean Sea, where he had his Lesbos and his Samos. It is absolutely incredible, but it is all the same a simple fact, that he knew every book and its location, having a sense of the feel as well as the shape of his favourites. This was not because he had the faintest approach to orderliness, for he would take down <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> volumes and never restore them to the same place by any chance. It was a sort of motherly instinct by which he watched over them all, and even loved prodigals who wandered over all the study and then set off on adventurous journeys into distant rooms. The restoration of an emigrant to his lawful home was celebrated by a feast, in which, by a confusion of circumstances, the book played the part of the fatted calf, being read afresh from beginning to end. During his earlier and...", "...nothing about the fight in the Adelphi when he took rooms there one hot August day in 1787. Besides, he had more important matters to occupy his thoughts. Only six weeks had passed since, between the hours of eleven and twelve at night, he had, in the summer house of his garden at Laussanne, written the last sentence of \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" and now he had arrived in London with the final instalment of the manuscript on which he had bestowed the labour of nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years. The heightened mood he experienced on the completion of his memorable task may well have persisted to the hour of his arrival in London. Some reflection of that feeling perhaps underlay the jocular announcement of his letter from the Adelphi to Lord Sheffield, wherein he wrote: \"INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY. This day (August the seventh) the celebrated E. G. arrived with a numerous retinue (one servant). We hear that he has brought over from Laussanne the remainder of his...", "...is the best for turning the key and obtaining safe conclusions,--no. I did not write before because I always do shrink from touching my own griefs, one feels at first so sore that nothing but stillness is borne. It is only after, when one is better, that one can express one's self at all. This is so with me, at least, though perhaps it ought not to be so with a poet. If you saw my \"De Profundis\" you must understand that it was written nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years ago, and referred to what went before. Mr. Howard's affliction made me think of the MS. (in reference to a sermon of Dr. Beecher's in the \"Independent\"), and I pulled it out of a secret place and sent it to America, not thinking that the publication would fall in so nearly with a new grief of mine as to lead to misconceptions. In fact the poem would have been an exaggeration in that case, and unsuitable in other respects. It refers...", "...they agreed, they had come to the hotel with the blackamoor at the door. While they lingered, sharing the splendid creature's hospitable pleasure in the spectacle he formed, they were aware of a carriage with liveried coachman and footman at the steps of the hotel; the liveries were very quiet and distinguished, and they learned that the equipage was waiting for the Prince of Coburg, or the Princess of Montenegro, or Prince Henry of Prussia; there were differing opinions among the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> or thirty bystanders. Mrs. March said she did not care which it was; and she was patient of the denouement, which began to postpone itself with delicate delays. After repeated agitations at the door among portiers, proprietors, and waiters, whose fluttered spirits imparted their thrill to the spectators, while the coachman and footman remained sculpturesquely impassive in their places, the carriage moved aside and let an energetic American lady and her family drive up to the...", "...and upward, all that were able to go forth to war, 1:33.

There were the usual jokes. Of course people asked about Chard. The President said that he knew nothing of the Junior Librarian. He trusted he would appear in time for his speech. And when he read out the motion before the house and the list of speakers he included Chard's name. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> minutes past eight the first speaker began. He finished at a quarter to nine and two others carried on the debate till half-past. The second of them had reached his peroration. The audience paid little heed to his anxiety about the ship of state. Where the devil was Chard? That was all that mattered. Was Chard really lying gagged and throttled in a ditch? The speaker sat down and the expectant audience forgot to applaud. There was a pause, followed by much pushing and...", "...neighbours of Rossetti's friends, Lord and Lady Mount Temple, between whom and Mr. Watts-Dunton there had been an affectionate intimacy for many years--but more notably Lancing, whither they went for three consecutive years. For several years they stayed during their holiday with Lady Mary Gordon, an aunt of Mr. Swinburne's, at 'The Orchard,' Niton Bay, Isle of Wight. During the hot summer of 1904 they were lucky enough to escape to Cromer, where the temperature was something like <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> degrees lower than that of London. A curious incident occurred during this visit to Cromer. One day Mr. Watts-Dunton took a walk with another friend to 'Poppy-land,' where he and Mr. Swinburne had previously stayed, in order to see there again the landslips which he has so vividly described in 'Aylwin.' While they were walking from 'Poppyland' to the old ruined churchyard called 'The Garden of Sleep,' they sat down for some time in the shade of an empty hut near the cliff....", "...me beforehand that I should do such a thing I should have laughed. Of course, if you look at it calmly, it's preposterous. Preposterous--there's no other word--from my point of view.

Still they were to be found, though it was rare, indeed, that they covered more than the centre of the room. One of these great essentials, without which no place can appear comfortable in a cold climate, was spread on the floor of Mrs. Willoughby's parlour--a room that served for both eating and as a sala, the Knight's Hall of the Hut, measuring <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> by twenty-four feet--though in fact this carpet concealed exactly two- thirds of the white clean plank. Then the chairs were massive and even rich, while one might see his face in the dark mahogany of the tables.

The wishes and desires of their great commander had become their law; and each one vied with the other in rendering obedience to his orders. Their fame had spread throughout lower Asia, and through many parts of Assyria. But the Babylonians thought themselves so well prepared for this emergency that the numerous legions of Cyrus failed to alarm them. Their walls they considered proof against any attack, and they had a sufficient amount of provision in the city for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> years. They laughed to scorn the demand of the Persians, and loudly ridiculed them from the city walls. Belshazzar and his counselors, considering themselves secure, gave way to their depraved appetites. The palace was one scene of debauchery and revelry by day and by night. The Persian general soon saw that an assault on such formidable defenses would be useless. A project was conceived in his mind. He made the inhabitants believe that he intended to reduce the city by...", "...adornments, or rather its vesture, in the ample drapery of waving palms and standing corn that excited the admiration of Herodotus.[27] But the general characteristics and leading contours of the landscape remain what they were.

Suppose yourself, in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, seated upon the summit of the temple of Bel, some hundred or hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> yards above the level of the plain. At such a height the smiling and picturesque details which were formerly so plentiful and are now so rare, would not be appreciated. The domed surfaces of the woods would seem flat, the varied cultivation, the changing colours of the fields and pastures would hardly be distinguished. You would be struck then, as you are struck to-day, by the extent and uniformity of the vast plain which stretches away to all the points of the compass.

The interior is very fine, with magnificently-painted ceilings, tapestries, statuary, and a rare collection of pictures. The tapestries represent Blenheim and other battles, and there are one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> copies of famous masters, made by Teniers. A stately statue of Queen Anne stands in the library. There are costly collections of enamels, plaques, and miniatures; on the walls are huge paintings by Sir James Thornhill, one representing the great duke, in a blue cuirass, kneeling before Britannia, clad in white and holding a lance and wreath; Hercules and Mars stand by, and there are emblem-bearing females and the usual paraphernalia. We are told that Thornhill was paid for these...", "...of his brothers had been starved to death in this fatal siege. So it went on, till in the month of June, when Napoleon had already descended from the Alps into the plain of Lombardy, the misery became unendurable, and Massena surrendered.

Other horrors which occurred besides during the blockade I pass over; the agonizing death of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty</span> thousand innocent and helpless persons requires nothing to be added to it! \"Now is it right that such a tragedy as this should take place, and that the laws of war should be supposed to justify the authors of it?
