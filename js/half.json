Is not the first wearing of one a trial, and a special ordeal? It is after the bloom is off the peach that a young woman is willing to show her pretty shoulders and neck to the crowd; and who cares much for a rubbed plum or a brushed peach?

One soldier, asked what he had done in the fight, replied that he had \"blown <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a Boche officer's leg off with a bomb.\" The General thought this excellent, but wanted to know why he had chosen half an officer only, and not a whole one.

For the first <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of the way, the road lay in the open valley, and had no shade; but, as soon as it began to wind in among the low hills, it had pine-trees on each side of it; the little house where Billy and Lucinda lived stood in a nook among these pines.

The unruly children and gossiping mothers at the poor doors discomposed her sadly, and she was not near so sure that her grey cloak defended her from all rudeness as she pretended to be when assenting to the enthusiasm of Mr Wentworth and Lucy.

It seems almost unaccountable that the manufacturers who so greatly improved the mechanism of the harpsichord at this stage failed to discover the hammer action.

It was an octopus in a fathomless sea extending a tentacle to grasp him. \"It will end,\" he told himself. \"All storms have an ending.\" This, he knew to be a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> truth.

Then, for the first time in all this storm he thought of Jerry. He turned to speak to him. To his great surprise he found him fast asleep. Fear seized him. Jerry might not be sleeping. The cold might have overcome him. He prodded him vigorously.

His manner changed with the abruptness of his moods. Sometimes active and alert, at others for days together he would become absent, dreamy, absorbed, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> oblivious of the outer world, his movements and actions dictated by subconscious instinct rather than regulated by volition. And one cause of that loneliness of spirit which was undoubtedly a chief pain in life to him, was the fact that ordinary folk were puzzled how to take him, or to know which of these many extreme moods was the man himself. Uncomfortable, unsatisfactory, elusive, not to be counted upon, they deemed him: and from their point of view they were undoubtedly right....", "...Hume who, on mature consideration declined it.

Wolves may also be taking a disproportionately high number of fawns, although our data do not show this. Nevertheless, there may be a bias against fawns in our method. It is not unusual to discover the remains of a wolf-killed deer so completely eaten that there is no indication left of the animal's age. Because fawns often are only about <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> the size of adult deer, and their skeletons have not yet completely ossified, the chances are better that fawns will be more completely eaten.

The smith was fully himself again, and was bawling for his subordinates, who had followed his example in indulging in the good cheer, and did not carry it off so easily.

His fire would burn out quickly; then the blade of the young Britisher, tireless and quick as I knew it to be, would let his blood before my very eyes. What to do I knew not.

I swear to you that in half a minute he had broken the sword of his Lordship, who took to the water, swimming for his life. I leaped in, catching him <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> over the eddy, where we fought like roadmen, striking in the air and bumping on the bottom. We were both near drowned when D'ri swam out and gave me his belt-end, hauling us in. I got to my feet soon.

You might have been hurt.\" We searched the island, high and low, for the ladies, but with no success. Then we marched our...", "...a great crime. The dowager countess, owing to her great age, had been compelled to take some rest. The count sat up, worn out with fatigue, in a downstairs room hard by that in which they were compassing the ruin of all most dear to him in the world. The countess, in her profound lethargy, gave birth, without being aware of it, to a boy, who thus fell on his entry into the world into the hands of his enemies, his mother powerless to defend him by her cries and tears. The door was <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> opened, and a man who was waiting outside brought in; this was the major-domo Baulieu. The midwife, pretending to afford the first necessary cares to the child, had taken it into a corner. Baulieu watched her movements, and springing upon her, pinioned her arms. The wretched woman dug her nails into the child's head. He snatched it from her, but the poor infant for long bore the marks of her claws. Possibly the Marchioness de Bouille could not nerve herself to the commission...", "...a lump on his forehead. He had run out of doors without waiting to hear the result of Marilla's fall. \"Well, Captain!\" said his father, holding out his hand.

I only hope Marilla won't have a bad time as she did last summer. Why she's never fainted since.\" Jack behaved beautifully at the table. No one spoke of the fight. But he kept up a shivery thought of wondering if the ball he had thrown at Marilla had really hurt her. It wasn't a hard ball, at least not as hard as they had sometimes in...", "...uncommon haste, I should say, sir,\" replied Collins, deliberately. I pushed back the untasted dish, and rose directly. \"You should have told me this before,\" I said, hastily. \"But--but surely, sir, you will dine--\" \"I will wait for nothing,\" I interrupted. \"I'll go at once.

Its former host and hostess were dead; a brewery occupied its site; and the White Horse was kept by a portly Boniface, who had been head-waiter under the extinct dynasty.

It was like getting home again, she said. The sound of the sea soothed her to sleep, and it woke her in the morning with a voice as familiar as if she had never been away. She was out, and away over the sands to the Tangle Stanes, and had renewed acquaintance with <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> the bairns in Portie, before Miss Jean was ready for her breakfast. The bairns had all grown big, and the streets and lanes, the houses and shops, had all grown narrow and small, she thought. But the sea had not changed, nor the sands, nor the far-away hills, nor the sky--which was, oh! so different from the sky in London. Marion had not changed much, her friends thought. Some of them said she was bigger and bonnier, but she was blithe and friendly and \"a'e fauld\" still--and...", "...lost'; but I am not sure.

We lay there, our blood running cold with unspeakable terror. The fireball, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of it white, half azure blue, and the size of a ten-inch shell, moved slowly about the raft, but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity, as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind.

St. Stephen, who was born in 725 A.D., had been placed in the monastery at the age of ten years by his uncle. He lived there more than <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a century until his death in 794 A.D. Neale was equally successful in the translation of ancient Latin hymns. Perhaps the most notable is his rendering of Bernard of Cluny's immortal hymn: Jerusalem, the golden, With milk and honey blest!

I did not for a minute imagine he had been hit, but merely thought he was making sure that the sniper had finished, so I touched him--and he <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> rolled towards me.

A dum-dum or explosive bullet had caught his jawbone and had blown the left lower jaw and part of the neck away.

He put a fire on, made tea, and he and Dan talked till near daybreak--Dad of the harvest, and the Government dam that was promised, and the splendid grass growing in the paddock; Dan of the great dry plains, and the shearing-sheds out back, and the chaps he had met there. And he related in a way that made Dad's eyes glisten and Joe's mouth open, how, with a knocked-up wrist, he shore beside Proctor and big Andy Purcell, at Welltown, and rung the shed by <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a sheep. Dad ardently admired Dan. Dan was only going to stay a short while at home, he said, then was off West again. Dad tried to persuade him to change his mind; he would have him remain and help to work the selection. But Dan only shook his head and laughed.

And, indeed, there was very little of the civilised man in Shere Ali's look at this moment. His own people were claiming him.

He recovered his composure the next moment. \"I don't think that I was speaking to you,\" he said quietly, and then turned away. Shere Ali <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> rose in his seat. But he was not yet quite emancipated from the traditions of his upbringing.

With this object he collected a force, which is said to have amounted to nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a million of men, and at the same time placed a flotilla of ships upon the Nile, which was of the greatest service in his later operations. Auaris was not only defended by broad moats connected with the waters of the Nile, but also bordered upon a lake, or perhaps rather a lagoon, of considerable dimensions. Hence it was necessary that it should be attacked not only by land, but also by water. Aahmes seems to have commanded the land forces in person, riding in a war-chariot, the...", "...over the place.\" He squinted at the line for a moment then spoke to the man standing nearby. \"Signal Harry to back her off two degrees, then run her up slowly, ten minutes at a time.\" The other man flickered the key on the side of the small carbide-Welsbach lamp.

These last seem to have been about one inch and a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> high, standing on a circular base of half an inch in diameter; but some are only one inch and a quarter in height, and little more than half an inch broad at the lower end. Others have been found, of ivory, one inch and six eighths high, and one and an eighth in diameter, with a small knob at the top, exactly like those represented at Beni Hassan, and the tombs near the Pyramids.

He also ordered the treasurer to make arrangements for a splendid funeral. The treasurer said, in reply, that a funeral would only be a temporary show, and that he could hereafter erect a _monument_ at <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> the cost, which would be a much more lasting memorial. Charles acceded. Afterward, when Charles spoke to him about the monument, the treasurer replied, What would the world say if your majesty were to build a monument to the Duke before you erect one for your father? So the plan was abandoned, and Buckingham had no other monument than the universal detestation of his countrymen. CHAPTER V.

Our route lay through a stony plain, and the night now becoming very dark, with incessant rain, my guides lost their way, and we continued for three hours uncertain whether we should not be obliged to take up our night's quarters in the open plain. At length, however, we came to the bed of a Wady called Hameka, which we ascended for a short distance, and in <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> an hour after crossing it reached Kereye, about ten at night; here we found a comfortable Fellah's house, and a copious dish of Bourgul. November 23d.--Kereye is a city containing about five hundred houses, of which four only were at this time inhabited. It has several ancient towers, and public buildings; of the latter the principal has a portico consisting of a triple row of six columns in each, supporting a flat roof; seven steps, extending the whole breadth of the portico,...", "...the bosom of the waters. \"Yes, they are preparing for work,\" muttered Danforth, as he saw a crowd of painted warriors arrange themselves around the camp-fire, each with his firelock in his hand. There was a general movement. Dark faces flitted in quick succession between him and the blaze as the warriors performed the heavy march, or war-dance, which usually preceded the going out of a hostile party. Danforth left the shore, and striking out in an oblique direction, arrived, after <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> an hour of quick walking, at the Indian encampment. He threaded his way through the cluster of bark wigwams, till he came to one standing on the verge of the inclosure. It was of logs, and erected with a regard to comfort which the others wanted. The young hunter drew aside the mat which hung over the entrance, and looked in. A young Indian girl was sitting on a pile of furs at the opposite extremity. She wore no paint--her cheek was round and smooth, and large gazelle-like eyes...", "...Illinois and Kansas in the Middle West; and Texas in the South. No fewer than seventeen others expanded by half a million or more--ten of the seventeen being in the valley drained by the Mississippi River system. Detailed study of particular sections of the country discloses a continuous shifting of population which indicates changes in the economic life of the people. In northern New England, the numbers increased slowly. Both Maine and New Hampshire lost from 1860 to 1870; nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of Maine's counties and nearly two-thirds of Vermont's lost population between 1880 and 1890; the people were abandoning the rural districts to flock to the cities or migrate to the West. Shipbuilding fell off in Maine; the dairy interests languished in Vermont, less wheat was being planted and the farmers, no longer growing wool, were selling their flocks. Most of the growth was to be found in the industrial counties. The traditional New England thrift, however, was not lost with...", "...with it on his breath, whereon she would weep over him as one lost to hope. One day, in a mood of brutal exasperation, when he hadn't had his drink and was able to discern the flavor of her grief, he turned on her: \"I'll tell you what's the matter with you,\" he said. \"You're drunk--maudlin drunk!\" She promptly and properly went into hysterics. The physician who attended diagnosed the case more politely, but to the same effect, and ascertained that she had consumed something like <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a bottle of Kilmer's Swamp-Root that afternoon. Now, Swamp-Root is a very creditable \"booze,\" but much weaker in alcohol than most of its class. The brother was greatly amused until he discovered, to his alarm, that his drink-abhorring sister couldn't get along without her patent medicine bottle! She was in a fair way, quite innocently, of becoming a drunkard. Another example of this \"unconscious drunkenness\" is recorded by the _Journal of the American Medical Association_: \"A...", "...for as they make their combs of the shavings of sound wood, which they rasp off with their fangs, and moisten up with a mucus from their bodies, they may often be found near such materials.

The Governor's tent was pitched on a piece of rising ground about four hundred yards from the Indian camp, and immediately facing it. As soon as the Governor and party arrived, the Indians who were to take part in the treaty, commenced to assemble near the Chief's tents, to the sound of beating drums and the discharge of small arms, singing, dancing and loud speaking, going on at the same time. In about <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> an hour they were ready to advance and meet the Governor; this they did in a large semi-circle; in their front were about twenty braves on horseback, galloping about in circles, shouting, singing and going through various picturesque performances. The semi-circle steadily advanced until within fifty yards of the Governor's tent, when a halt was made and further peculiar ceremonies commenced, the most remarkable of which was the \"dance of the stem.\" This was commenced by the...", "...Hoisted on the female, whom he embraces and holds with his two pairs of hind-legs, the male sways his head and corselet up and down, all in a piece.

The officer's face became vacant, then twisted, seeming to reflect painful mental effort. Slowly, he leaned forward again, touching another switch. Then, he sank back, to concentrate on his thoughts. Jaeger looked again at the boy, who was sitting tensely, his hands gripping the arms of his chair, his eyes fastened fearfully on the officer before him. As Jaeger watched, Elwar <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> rose from his chair, then sank back, his face appearing to mirror Kweiros' efforts. [Illustration] At last, Kweiros sat up.

Of course it is ridiculous to talk of any question of beauty having been considered. You know you are absurdly pretty, Teresa, and are merely trying to make some one say so,\" Joan remarked, half serious and <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> amused. As a matter of fact, she was not enthusiastic over being chosen for one of the principal parts in the Greek tableaux. She was not particularly popular with the Boy Scouts. The boys liked half a dozen of the other girls better, although Tory Drew, Dorothy McClain and Teresa were the chief favorites. \"See here, Teresa, don't be tiresome.

The third and final step came with the erection of a new type of school building, with smaller and individual classrooms, or the subdivision of the larger schoolrooms.

The transition to the graded elementary school came easily and naturally. For <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a century the course of instruction in the evolving elementary state school had been in process of expansion. Pestalozzi paved the way for its creation by changing the purpose and direction, and greatly enlarging (p. 543) the field of instruction of the vernacular school.

I had sixty feet of rope in my cart, and I went quietly...", "...man, it is _the slow torture of hunger and thirst_; when it was found that this had not the effect of debasing the American spirit, the young sufferer was brought upon deck, and stripped to his waist, and sometimes lower, and--Oh! my pen cannot write it for indignation! resentment, and a righteous revenge shakes my hand with rage, while I attempt to record the act of villany.

With this heavy and knotted scourge, the boatswain's mate, who is...", "...\"come into the dining-room, and have a glass of milk.\" But Mrs. Billing dismissing the proffered refreshment with a dramatic wave of her hand, subsided upon the only chair in the narrow hall and gasped out: \"I have just come from 'Littlecote.' Mr. Shafto is gone--he died last night!\" CHAPTER II WHAT HANNAH SAID On hearing this announcement, Jane Tebbs gave a little lurch and leant against the wall in speechless horror; and yet in her heart she had been more than <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> expecting--we will not say hoping for--some tragedy. Then she made a rush to the store-room, where Miss Mitty, invested in a large blue apron, was methodically marking eggs. \"Sister, sister, come out!\" she cried. \"Mrs. Billing is here; she says Mr. Shafto is dead; I told you that something had happened!\" \"Dead!\" repeated Mitty, staring blankly at her relative. Then she cast aside her apron and hurried into the hall. \"Let us all go into the dining-room,\" she continued,...", "...or a cannon shot was fired before noon, however. There was no need of a signal for battle as the terrible contest began on both sides simultaneously about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Napoleon commanding and leading the charge, and accompanied by Lannes and Massena. One of the most beautiful sights war could produce now presented itself; one hundred and ten thousand men were attacked on all points, turned to their left, and successively driven from all their positions, although not a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of the French troops were engaged. The battle was stern and lasted until twilight, ending with the utter defeat of the Archduke's army, and leaving Napoleon with 20,000 prisoners, fifteen imperial standards and a vast number of cannon in his hands, while the defeated and routed enemy fled back in confusion on the city of Ratisbon. The Austrian cavalry, strong and numerous, attempted to cover the retreat of the infantry, but was attacked by the French both on the right and left....", "...He made worse and worse weather of it as Dick Rendal covered the distance between them with a superlatively fine side-stroke, once or twice singing out to him to hold on, and keep a good heart. Mr Markham, whether he heard or no, held on with great courage, and even coolness--up to a point. Then of a sudden his nerve deserted him. He loosed his hold of the life-belt, and struck out for his Rescuer. Worse, as he sank in the effort and Dick gripped him, he closed and struggled. For <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a minute Dick, shaking free of the embrace--and this only by striking him on the jaw and half stunning him as they rose on the crest of a swell--was able to grip him by the collar and drag him within reach of the life-belt. But here the demented man managed to wreathe his legs and arms in another and more terrible hold. The pair of them were now cursing horribly, cursing whenever a wave left choking them, and allowed them to cough and sputter for breath. They fought as two men...", "...in his eyes. They were directed at the plate, but saw it not. \"Poor fellow,\" she murmured compassionately; \"he's been awfully sick, hasn't he?\" \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Hugh heartlessly. \"They don't go to eating in a day's time if they have been very sick.\" A bright look flashed into her eyes and they danced with merriment as she whispered something in his ear. \"By George, maybe you're right. He's a detective and chasing us to earth.\" The stranger looked at them in a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> interested manner when they laughed aloud over the harrowing supposition. They noticed that his eyes were blue and bloodshot, wan and fatigued. He gave Grace a second glance, sharper than the first, and politely resumed his manufacture of circles in the brown gravy and brown study. Miss Vernon flushed slightly. As they left the table she said to Hugh: \"He remembers me, but he certainly understands it was a mistake, doesn't he?\" Hugh looked at her distressed face and...", "...He had hardly time to finish the words when the sutler himself came galloping over the parade, \"hot foot,\" on his wiry mustang, and drew up in front of the gate. \"Has the sergeant told you?\" he asked, breathlessly. \"It's Reed and his partner,--two of the best men on my ranch,--and they can't be mistaken. You know what it must mean, gentlemen. The gang is after the paymaster, and I think Colonel Frazier should know at once.\" No wonder Fuller was breathless, bareheaded, and only <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> dressed. Anywhere from thirty to forty thousand dollars might be diverted from its proper and legitimate use if that Friday gang should overpower the guard and get away with it. His coffers were filled with sutler checks redeemable in currency at the pay-table, as was the wonted way of the old army. It was a case of feast or famine with Fuller, and he poured his tale into sympathetic ears. Brooks himself went over to the colonel's, and found that weasel of a chief already awake....", "...and he'll bring his creatures with him.\" \"Oh! Oh!\" Colin cried out in delight. \"But that's not all,\" Mary went on, almost pale with solemn excitement. \"The rest is better. There is a door into the garden. I found it. It is under the ivy on the wall.\" If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted \"Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!\" but he was weak and rather hysterical; his eyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath. \"Oh! Mary!\" he cried out with a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> sob. \"Shall I see it? Shall I get into it? Shall I _live_ to get into it?\" and he clutched her hands and dragged her toward him. \"Of course you'll see it!\" snapped Mary indignantly. \"Of course you'll live to get into it! Don't be silly!\" And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she brought him to his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutes afterward she was sitting on her stool again telling him not what she imagined the secret garden to be...", "...the Millicent whose pallid and troubled phantom already paced the foot-bridge? He did not realize that he had drawn up his horse suddenly at the sight of her, nor did he notice that his host had dismounted, until Roxby was at the chestnut's head, ready to lead the animal to supper in the barn. His evident surprise, his preoccupation, were not lost upon Roxby, however. His hand hesitated on the girth of the chestnut's saddle when he stood between the two horses in the barn. He had <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> intended to disregard the stranger's declination of his invitation, and stable the creature. Then he shook his head slowly; the mystery that hung about the new-comer was not reassuring. \"A heap o' wuthless cattle 'mongst them valley men,\" he said; for the war had been in some sort an education to his simplicity. \"Let him stay whar the cunnel expected him ter stay.

Margaret lay down to rest, to sweet sleep, for a couple of hours: and when she appeared below, her brother and sister had <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> done breakfast, and Mr Grey and his twin daughters were with them. Mr Grey came to say that he and all his family were to leave Deerbrook in two hours. Where they should settle for the present, they had not yet made up their minds.

Those who live in the midst of democratic fluctuations have always before their eyes the phantom of chance; and they end by liking all undertakings in which chance plays a part.

The United States of America have only been emancipated for <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a century [in 1840] from the state of colonial dependence in which they stood to Great Britain; the number of large fortunes there is small, and capital is still scarce. Yet no people in the world has made such rapid progress in trade and manufactures as the Americans: they constitute at the present day the second maritime nation in the world; and although their manufactures have to struggle with almost insurmountable natural impediments, they are not prevented from making great...", "...and armies. This indeed appears to be a consideration of some weight; but then, on the other side, several things deserve to be considered likewise: as, first, whether it may not be thought necessary that in certain tracts of country, like what we call parishes, there should be one man at least of abilities to read and write. Then it seems a wrong computation that the revenues of the Church throughout this island would be large enough to maintain two hundred young gentlemen, or even <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> that number, after the present refined way of living, that is, to allow each of them such a rent as, in the modern form of speech, would make them easy.

But of all these men, the most aggressively active, the most despotic in his measures, was Pix, the manager of the provincial traffic department.

He arranged the whole exports of the house, knew every thing, was always to be found, and could do <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a dozen things at once. Like all dignitaries, he was impatient of contradiction, and fought for his opinions against the merchant himself with a stiff-neckedness that often horrified Anton. One of his peculiarities was that of abhorring a vacuum as much as nature herself. Wherever there was an empty corner, a closet, a cellar, a recess to be discovered, there Pix would intrude with tuns, ladders, ropes, and all imaginable commodities; and wherever he and his giant band of porters...", "...at Lorraine. \"To-night I can't talk with my mind,\" Swan told her bluntly. \"Not always I can do that.

Having attended to their horses, which they hobbled to prevent their straying, Mr. Hardy and the boys sat down and made a slight meal. None of them felt very hungry, the excitement of the approaching attack having driven away the keen appetite that they would have otherwise gained from their ride; but Mr. Hardy begged the boys to endeavour to eat something, as they would be sure to feel the want of food later....", "...he would, after all, have torn you and the princess into pieces.' 'And if I had not sewn the boat together again,' said the tailor, 'you would all have been drowned, therefore she is mine.' Then the king put in a word, and said, 'Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a reward for his skill, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a kingdom.' So the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.

This makes clear the distinction between the relative measure of an angle and the absolute measures, such, for instance, as the meter. Thus, a degree may be measured on this page, while a second (the 3,600th part of a degree) measured in the sky may correspond to millions of kilometers. Now the measure of the Moon's diameter gives us an angle of a little more than half a degree. If it were exactly <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a degree, we should know by that that it was 114 times the breadth of its disk away from us. But it is a little less, since we have more than half a degree (31'), and the geometric ratio tells us that the distance of our satellite is 110 times its diameter. Hence we have very simply obtained a first idea of the distance of the Moon by the measure of its diameter. Nothing could be simpler than this method. The first step is made. Let us continue. This approximation tells us...", "...convinced that it was a pirate. I directed the captain, who was taking his siesta, to be awaked instantly, showed him the craft, and advised him to alter our course, that we might avoid her. The captain, a man of unfortunate temper, whose principal traits of character were arrogance, avarice, and obstinacy, scorned my counsel, and insisted that we had nothing to fear, as we were perfectly well protected by the English flag. We sailed on, while the schooner drew nearer, for about <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a league, when we observed that the deck of the strange vessel swarmed with armed men, and her people were busy in getting out their boats. Upon seeing this, our captain was not a little frightened, and ordered a change in the course of the ship; but it was too late, for we were already within reach of the pirate, who soon hailed us, commanding our captain to come on board of his vessel, and as his commands were not obeyed, fired a broadside into us, which, however, did us no...", "...without a salad of some kind.

Jessie, for some unknown reason, was full of <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little trilling laughs when any one spoke to her. A sheet of lilac note paper, folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in equal danger of irremediable \"mussing,\" as she fidgetted about on the carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves. Mr. Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs in the house, one...", "...I'd be so proud of him. He'd be beautiful in khaki. But there's work to do right here. And he ought to be willing to wait six months.\" \"They can't wait six months over there, Emma. They need him now.\" \"Oh, come, T.A.! One man--\" \"Multiplied by a million. Look at Fisk. Just such another case. Look at--\" The shrill summons of the telephone cut him short. Emma's head came up alertly. She glanced at her wrist-watch and gave a little exclamation of horror. \"That's for me! I'm <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> an hour late! The first time, too.\" She was at the telephone a second later, explanatory, apologetic. Then back in the dining-room doorway, her cheeks flushed, tugging at her gloves, poised for flight. \"Sorry, dear. But this morning was so important, and that letter about Jock upset me. I'm afraid I'm a rotten soldier.\" \"I'm afraid you are, Emma.\" She stared at that. \"Why--! Oh, you're still angry at something. Listen, dear--I'll call for you at the office to-night at five,...", "...look starved, Captain Hannock,\" said Captain Flagg coldly. \"I never show it in my face,\" was the smooth reply. \"But all the same, I am mighty hungry.\" \"You shall have breakfast very soon.\" And then as Mr. Henshaw gave him a peculiar look, the captain continued: \"Won't you step into the cabin?\" \"Thanks: I will. Where are you bound?\" \"For Boston.\" \"That will just suit me. I can't pay for the passage though. I haven't any money.\" \"Was your vessel insured?\" \"Only about <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> value.\" The two captains and Mr. Henshaw disappeared into the cabin. We waited impatiently. \"I guess he's done for,\" said Phil. \"Yes; Mr. Henshaw intends to arrest them one at a time, so there will be no fuss,\" replied the lawyer. About five minutes after there was a call for Lowell, and a minute after one for Crocker. \"That settles it,\" said Phil with a grin. \"Were none of the others in it?\" asked Mr. Ranson of me. \"I hardly think so.\" Just then one of the...", "...they fell far short of expectation. Which of us has not looked forward, some time or another, to receiving a letter which we are convinced will have an important effect upon our minds? It will clear up a mystery, give specific information, console us in affliction, or furnish the exact counsels which we need; we depend upon it for one or all of these things, and we continue to do so, even though the letter which arrives after so much anticipation is almost always inadequate. It tells us <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> instead of all we expected our correspondent to know, its advice has overlooked our difficulties and does not meet the case, its words of comfort are few and arid. Yet hope leads us ever on, and the envelope bearing our friend's handwriting is torn open with as much eagerness at the fiftieth crisis as at the first. Georgiana put down Elizabeth's letter with a feeling of disappointment, yet telling herself that she could not have expected anything else. Elizabeth wrote that various...", "...on the snowy peaks far in the purple distance. Manning waited. \"Finally the rod came out,\" Russ went on. \"Mind you, it came out, even after I would have sworn, if I had relied alone upon my eyes, that it hadn't entered the sphere at all. _But it came out ninety degrees removed from its point of entry!_\" \"Wait a second,\" said Manning. \"This doesn't check. Did you do it more than once?\" \"I did it a dozen times and the results were the same each time. But you haven't heard the <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of it. When I pulled that rod out--yes, I could pull it out--it was a good two inches shorter than when I had pushed it in. I couldn't believe that part of it. It was even harder to believe than that the rod should come out ninety degrees from its point of entry. I measured the rods after that and made sure. Kept an accurate record. Every single one of them lost approximately two inches by being shoved into the sphere. Every single one of them repeated the phenomenon of curving...", "...conversation as they rode. \"Do you suppose those men I saw on the cliff are part of the gang?\" hazarded Tom. \"They may be. I never thought of them,\" declared Bill. \"I must remember to speak about them to father. Still, I hardly think they could have had a hand in it. It is all of thirty miles from where we saw them to the Long Creek bottoms, and no sizeable herd of cattle could be driven through the hills that far in a day. Twenty miles on the prairies is a stiff hike and <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> that far would be a good drive in the mountains.\" When they were obliged to ride Indian file over the trail much talking was not attempted, and each boy busied himself with his own thoughts. Because of his knowledge of the route, Bill led and Larry brought up the rear. Their advance was slow, however, as they wished to give the pony Tom rode as much chance to rest as possible before they reached the plains. With eyes and ears alert, they proceeded, and without mishap...", "...when they've done their bitter worst,\" added Charles Moses; \"when they've set a man against Heaven, and life in general, and made him pretty well hungry to creep into his grave and get out of it; when they've driven him to the edge of madness and forced him to damn and blast 'em to the pit--then what do the long-haired humans do?\" \"Why, they jump into his lap,\" declared Mr. Crocker, \"and kiss his eyes, and press their soft carcases against him, all purring and cooing--half cats and <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> pigeons that they be!\" \"And the men give way,\" summed up Mr. Moses. \"Leastways the manly, large-minded sort, like 'Dumpling' and me and Crocker. We can't stand against 'em--not for a moment.\" \"We take, when our turn comes, in fear and trembling,\" continued Bartley, \"and we hope we'll be one of the lucky ones.\" \"The fear and trembling comes afterwards, as you'll find some day, Bartley, and as Screech here may find any day,\" foretold Moses. \"Every man backs his own judgment...", "...cheering.\"' \"What is he like, Dick--I mean, to look at? Like a gentleman, or what?\" Shelton stifled a desire to laugh. \"He looks very well in a frock-coat,\" he replied; \"his father was a wine merchant.\" Antonia flicked her whip against her skirt. \"Of course,\" she murmured, \"I don't want to hear if there's anything I ought not.\" But instead of soothing Shelton, these words had just the opposite effect. His conception of the ideal wife was not that of one from whom the <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of life must be excluded. \"It's only,\" he stammered again, \"that it's not cheerful.\" \"Oh, all right!\" she cried, and, touching her horse, flew off in front. \"I hate dismal things.\" Shelton bit his lips. It was not his fault that half the world was dark. He knew her words were loosed against himself, and, as always at a sign of her displeasure, was afraid. He galloped after her on the scorched turf. \"What is it?\" he said. \"You 're angry with me!\" \"Oh no!\"...", "...too rich in that sort of thing. Ten dollars.\" \"If you please,\" began Gerhardt, but the court officer was already pushing him away. \"I don't want to hear any more about it,\" said the judge. \"He's stubborn, anyhow. What's the next case?\" Gerhardt made his way over to his boy, abashed and yet very glad it was no worse. Somehow, he thought, he could raise the money. Sebastian looked at him solicitously as he came forward. \"It's all right,\" said Bass soothingly. \"He didn't give me <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a chance to say anything.\" \"I'm only glad it wasn't more,\" said Gerhardt nervously. \"We will try and get the money.\" Going home to his wife, Gerhardt informed the troubled household of the result. Mrs. Gerhardt stood white and yet relieved, for ten dollars seemed something that might be had. Jennie heard the whole story with open mouth and wide eyes. It was a terrible blow to her. Poor Bass! He was always so lively and good-natured. It seemed awful that he should be in...", "...on, and I would not awaken her for fear any sudden exclamation might startle him in the opposite cabin. The observations and action thus described occupied but a short time. Thoughts are quick, but at such a crisis they speed like lightning. Our work, too, was rapid, and soon would be accomplished; and it would only remain to bring Marie from the cabin to the boat, through the stern ports of the lorcha. The stanchion was about four inches thick, and my friend had cut it more than <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> through, when, suddenly he sank down in the boat, exclaiming, \"hish.\" Reaching to me, he whispered that some one was unlocking the cabin door from the outside. I instantly changed places with him, and, raising myself cautiously to a level with the port, peeped through. I saw the door slowly opening, while a hand passed through was holding the furniture that had been piled up, and keeping it from falling as the door was gradually pressed inwards. Marie had evidently fallen into a...", "...might be cultivated. At the extreme southern point of the elbow, there comes in a stream, the size of which was not ascertained, but from appearances it is of sufficient size to propel a considerable amount of machinery. There are several islands in the river opposite the lower point of this bottom, and at the northern angle the Columbia is not more than three-fourths of a mile wide. This is called Oak point, and holds out good inducements for a settlement. There is an Indian village <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a mile below the point; and opposite, upon the northern side of the river, a good millstream, the falls being near the river, and the mountain covered with timber.[186] Immediately above the point, the river spreads out to one and a half or two miles in width, and having several islands, portions of which are covered with cottonwood, oak and ash timber, the remainder being nearly all prairie.

But I was deceived, for when I went within I saw a man and a woman and they fighting. I asked them to be so good as to interrupt their battle to give me a pot of bruinbier, were it one quart or <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a dozen; but the woman, a regular stokfisch, in a fury, answered that if I did not be off from there as quickly as possible she would make me swallow the sabot with which she was beating her husband over the head. And so, my friend, here I am, sweating sore and sore wearied. Have you not anything to eat?\" \"Aye,\" said Ulenspiegel. \"At last!\" said Lamme. IV Thus re-united, they went on their way together.

There is a Titian picture of Pompey's daughter receiving the tidings of Pharsalia, and, while too proud to show her agony, is yet in the very struggle of a breaking heart: the face is like enough to have been her portrait, and even to the color of the massive, waving hair, is wonderfully identical. The play had already begun when we arrived at the theatre, and in the little bustle caused by our entry into the box, a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> impatient expression ran through the audience; but as suddenly suppressed, it became a murmur of wondering admiration. The stage was forgotten, and every eye turned at once towards her who so often had moved their hearts by every emotion, and who now seemed even more triumphant in the calm self-possession of her beauty. Rank over rank leaned forward in the boxes to gaze at her, and the entire pit turned and stood, as it were, spell-bound at her feet. Had she wished for a triumph...", "...ground was little more than a stretch of flat meadow land. \"Hurrah!\" shouted Sam. \"How good to be on land once more!\" \"Perhaps we might have been on land long ago if we had turned to the left,\" observed Frank. \"We may have been skirting the shore for half the afternoon!\" \"Never mind, we are here at last so don't let's grumble,\" said Tom. \"What's that ahead, a barn?\" \"Some kind of a building,\" answered Dick. \"Let us go forward and investigate.\" They did so, and found a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> tumbled down building, which had once been used for the storage of meadow hay and also as a boathouse. The door was gone and the window broken out, and the snow lay on the floor to the depth of an inch or more.

Black Roger guessed something of his thought, and his mouth for an instant repressed a smile. \"Yes, I have been having a rough time,\" he nodded, \"This is for you!\" He placed the basket on the table. It held <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a bushel, and was filled to the curve of the handle.

Over and over again he would tell himself that he was not her sort, but when he held her thus throbbing against his heart, he knew beyond all questioning that they were one. \"You haven't told me a single thing about today's meeting,\" she murmured presently.

Though it lacks the savage grandeur of some parts of Majorca, Iviza has beautiful and romantic scenery, and life in the lovely island is sweet and simple and wholesome. There is little money in circulation, but more is not needed. The ground is fertile, the climate gracious, the water-supply is unfailing, and fish may be had for the catching. So food is plentiful and cheap. House rent in the town of Iviza may be counted at about a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> less than in Palma, and when the townsfolk speak of the cost of living in the smaller towns, such as San Antonio, they hold up their hands at the amazing cheapness of it. This, then, was our impression of Iviza, the remote island about which such extravagant tales are circulated.

Possibly, it had always been so, and had been merely waiting to emerge. . . . But such intangible and elusive emotions were so new to him that he could not pretend to deal with them.

As it turned out, the day selected for the voyage was a lucky one, for that night it blew a fresh gale outside, and the handling of so large a vessel, in light trim, by the tugs would have been difficult, probably involving the parting of hawsers. The spot selected was about <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a mile above the town, and the ship was securely moored, head and stern, to four heavy anchors, so as to be absolutely stationary, and quite close to the western shore. There was a busy time then for all hands: clearing away rocks abreast the ship, making a beach for the cadets' boats, a landing place and cricket ground, with direct access up the steep bank, so as to avoid the town, and so on. A great deal of this work was done, more or less in the rough, by the ship's company,...", "...amount; there is plenty to do here.

The metal guarantee, silver and gold, must cover half of the note circulation, when the latter is between fifteen hundred and two thousand millions, and two-thirds when the circulation exceeds two thousand.

Bill Dozier was with him, Bill who was the black sheep in the fine old Dozier family. His brother, Hal Dozier, was by many odds the most respected and the most feared man in the region, but of all the good Dozier qualities Bill inherited only their fighting capacity. He fought; he loved trouble; and for that reason, and not because he needed the money, he was now acting as a deputy sheriff. He was jesting with Buck Heath in a rather superior manner, half contemptuous, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> amused by Buck's alcoholic swaggerings. And Buck was just sober enough to perceive that he was being held lightly. He hated Dozier for that treatment, but he feared him too much to take open offense. It was at this opportune moment that old man Lanning, apparently half out of breath, touched Buck on the elbow. As Buck turned with a surly \"What the darnation?\" the other whispered: \"Be on your way, Buck. Get out of town, and get out of trouble.

Some of these records were in Latin,--an unknown tongue to Peter,--some in a quaint English almost as unintelligible; but none as foreign to him as the dead themselves. Their banners waved above his head; their voices filled the silent church, but fell upon his vacant eye and duller ear. He was none of them. Presently he was conscious of a footstep, so faint, so subtle, that it might have come from a peregrinating ghost. He turned quickly and saw Lady Elfrida, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> bold, yet half frightened, halting beside a pillar of the chancel. But there was nothing of the dead about her: she was radiating and pulsating with the uncompromising and material freshness of English girlhood. The wild rose in the hedgerow was not more tangible than her cheek, nor the summer sky more clearly cool and blue than her eyes. The vigor of health and unfettered freedom of limb was in her figure from her buckled walking-shoe to her brown hair topped by a sailor hat. The...", "...that the success of the plan involved the repulse of one-half Lee's army with ten thousand men. The assault on Marye's Hill was an equally fatal military mistake. That the position could not be stormed, is proved by the result of the actual attempt. It is doubtful if, in any battle ever fought by any troops, men displayed greater gallantry. They rushed headlong, not only once, but thrice, into the focus of a frightful front and cross fire of artillery and small-arms, losing nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> their numbers in a few minutes; the ground was littered with their dead, and yet the foremost had only been able to approach within sixty yards of the terrible stone wall in advance of the hill. There they fell, throwing up their hands to indicate that they saw at last that the attempt to carry the hill was hopeless. These comments seem justified by the circumstances, and are made with no intention of casting obloquy upon the commander who, displaying little ability, gave...", "...and swept him off into a veritable new world of views and aspirations, had been a likely school of merriment.

Yet so fleeting was the population that the almost weekly arrivals and departures perpetually disorganized his attempts to observe them as individuals or to theorize upon them in the mass.

It was a silent and a dreary house, and although children would doubtless have been a nuisance, Michael sometimes wished that the landlady's strict regulation no longer to take them in could be relaxed.

Gordon scored too late. But with a lead of two runs things looked bright for Clearfield. The Point again failed to cross the platter, although Loring Townsend got as far as second. Tom's shoots were too much for the home team. Neither side scored in the fourth.

Lanny flied out to left fielder and Pete reached second ahead of the throw-in. Fudge went out on strikes and, with Tom Haley up, the inning seemed over.

The Latitudinarianism which occupies so conspicuous and important a place in English ecclesiastical history during the <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> century which followed upon the Revolution of 1688 has been discussed in some of its aspects in the preceding chapter. It denoted not so much a particular Church policy as a tone or mode of thought, which affected the whole attitude of the mind in relation to all that wide compass of subjects in which religious considerations are influenced by difference of view as to the province and authority of the individual reason. But that which gave Latitudinarianism its chief notoriety,...", "...seemed to become diluted, as it were, with the advancing light that we could almost see sliding along the surface of the water, until suddenly, as though emerging from an invisible mist, a ghostly object appeared, grey and elusive, against the background of darkness, and with one voice we all three shouted: \"There she is?\" Yes, there she was--a large ship, about seven miles away, lying becalmed, like ourselves, with all plain sail set, to her royals and flying-jib. For perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a minute after our first sight of her the light was too weak and uncertain to enable us to discern details; but as we kept our telescopes persistently bearing upon her, first one distinctive feature and then another became revealed. \"She's a full-rigged ship, lying broadside-on to us, Mr Delamere,\" announced young Dundas. \"So I perceive,\" I returned somewhat dryly. \"And I notice, also, that she has swung with her head to the southward.\" \"She's a big lump of a craft, not...", "...they came to the conclusion that he had made up his mind to propose for Helen--it must be so, else why Dr. Sherman and Mrs. Cameron present?--this point, therefore, was settled--at least with the Falkners, of her acceptance of him, a rich East Indian, oh there could be no doubt of that.

In Group C, the variation takes place in the larvae rather than in the butterflies. These may go on in the normal way up to the time the caterpillars of the summer brood become <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> grown.

In Group D we have another interesting variation of the larvae. These are the same as C up to the time of becoming lethargic, that is, the larvae of the summer or second...", "...at meals.

The agricultural sector, which accounts for over <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP, is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land.

Pasteboard is fitted around the shaft at the ends of the box to keep the melted metal from running out. Never use clay or putty, it is too mussy and the babbitt is made rough and uneven at the edges.

Hence, for the far-seeing promoter, the pressure is toward making some at least of the fictitious capital pay dividends. What is the principle in this case?

If a proposed product has a possible utility, but at the same time involves so much risk that in the long run only <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of such enterprises will succeed, society may consider it worth offering a profit equal to fifty per cent. in order to pay for the risk. If, on the other hand, the income is to derive from valuable public franchises, or from the growth of the community and its necessities, the case is different. Here there is little, if any, risk for which it is fair for society to pay.

He had asked her to come alone, and, after a swift look, half fearful, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> desperate, she consented. It was an unheard-of thing in Spanish etiquette. But he believed she would fulfill the bargain. And if she did, he asked himself, what should he say--or do? For, perhaps, the first time in his life McTurpin was uncertain. Suddenly the road turned and he came upon her. She stood beside her horse, the morning sunlight in her wondrous dark hair. The ride had brought fresh color to her face and sparkle to her eyes.

Looking carefully at it the detective saw a tiny brown spot, the mark of a burn, upon one of the white surfaces. Beside it lay a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> used match. Walking around this carefully, Muller approached the candlestick that interested him and holding up his light he examined every inch of its surface. He found what he was looking for.

She was sure that his Mediterranean trip would introduce him to girls so much lovelier than Lucy that he would practically have forgotten her when he returned. Harry had been in love with <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a dozen girls before Lucy. She let Harry slip out of her consideration. John's case was different. It was vitally true and intense. She understood that John must marry or be miserable, and she faced the situation with brimming eyes and a very heavy heart. She had given John her loving sympathy, and she would not retract a word of it to him. But to God she could open her heart and to Him she could tell even those little things she would not speak of to any human being. She could...", "...will want to know that we have arrived all right; and wait at the hotel till I send for you.\" \"You had much better let me come with you, mother.\" The noise was so great that she only made a \"No\" with her mouth, shaking her head as she got into the cab, and gave him the address to show the cabman. Then, before Horace had awakened from his surprise, she was gone, and he was left, feeling very solitary, pushed about by all the passers-by upon the pavement. The youth was half angry, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> astonished. To go back to the hotel was not a thing that tempted him, but he was so young that he obeyed by instinct, meaning to pour forth his indignation to Milly.

Tell me, Beatrice, did you ever hear of a Miss Dunstable?\" CHAPTER IX Sir Roger Scatcherd Enough has been said in this narrative to explain to the reader that Roger Scatcherd, who was whilom a drunken stone-mason in Barchester, and who had been so prompt to avenge the injury done to his sister, had become a great man in the world. He had become a contractor, first for little things, such as <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a mile or so of a railway embankment, or three or four canal bridges, and then a contractor for great things, such as Government hospitals, locks, docks, and quays, and had latterly had in his hands the making of whole lines of railway. He had been occasionally in partnership with one man for one thing, and then with another for another; but had, on the whole, kept his interests to himself, and now at the time of our story, he was a very rich man. And he had acquired more...", "...in this respect so is such condition slavery. In the same way, it may happen in divisions between heirs that a slave will fall to several, and serves each one for the time that is due him. When the slave is not wholly slave, but half or fourth, he has the right, because of that part that is free, to compel his master to emancipate him for a just price. This price is appraised and regulated for persons according to the quality of their slavery, whether it be saguiguilir or namamahay, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> slave or quarter slave. But, if he is wholly slave, the master cannot be compelled to ransom or emancipate him for any price. The usual price of a sanguiguilir slave among the natives is, at most, generally ten taes of good gold, or eighty pesos; if he is namamahay, half of that sum. The others are in the same proportion, taking into consideration the person and his age. No fixed beginning can be assigned as the origin of these kinds of slavery among these natives, because...", "...will have to swim, we had better leave them on this side.\" The raft was launched, and it was pushed out with the poles, but before going very far it was seen that the idea was impracticable, and it might be a hazardous operation. \"This won't do.

They fell into the hall together. Sir James came forward from the library door. \"Hullo! What's this?\" He stepped forward, and put his arm round Jane as she swayed uncertainly. He <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> carried her into the library, and laid her on the leather couch. From a tantalus on the table he poured out a few drops of brandy, and forced her to drink them. With a sigh she sat up, her eyes still wild and frightened. \"It's all right. Don't be afraid, my child. You're quite safe.\" Her breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to her cheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically. \"So you're not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy of yours...", "...He now appeared out of breath, wiped his youthful, bald head, which really gave him the look of a priest, and by these drolleries put the light- hearted company in such good humor that every one was eager to hear him longer.

To find Agamemnon would have been a romantic exploit thoroughly in accordance with the bent of Schliemann's mind, and a fitting crown to a life which in itself was the very romance of exploration. But Schliemann had done something infinitely more important than to make the find of a dead King, even though that King had reigned for more than two and a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> millenniums in the greatest poem of the world; he had begun the resurrection of a dead civilization. Besides the great discovery of the Shaft-Graves, Schliemann carried on the exploration of the famous beehive tombs in the lower city of Mycenae.

Drake, it is true, appropriated and brought home a million and a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of Spanish treasure, while England and Spain were at peace. He took that treasure because for many years the officers of the Inquisition had made free at their pleasure with the lives and goods of English merchants and seamen. The king of Spain, when appealed to, had replied that he had no power over the Holy House; and it was necessary to make the king of Spain, or the Inquisition, or whoever were the parties responsible, feel that they could not play their pious pranks with...", "...cases, robberies, murders--I have felt the presence of this force, and I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally consulted.

I would never eat mouse again, if I could always have weasel.\" And he <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> closed his old eyes with delight as he spoke. \"And why not?\" he continued, brightening up; \"there were five of them, and I only had one. So here I go.\" And away flew the owl out of the topmost window of the tower, and flapping his great lazy wings in the air, made directly over the trees to the spot where the weasel had her nest. \"I shouldn't wonder,\" said one bat to another, \"if our friend Mr Owl finds more than his match to-night.\" Farmer Hodge, plodding wearily...", "...all around,\" of avoiding any bitter and prolonged partisanship, is the keynote of _Punch's_ popularity and prestige.

Of this sum L3,993,196 came from Madras, and L835,376 from Burma, which provinces were not included in the empire of Akbar; nor was a great part of Bombay (probably about half) under Akbar's revenue system. In Bombay land revenue (including Sind) in 1877 was L3,344,664; and half this sum L1,672,332. For a rough comparison these three sums (namely the amount of land revenue from Madras, Burma, and <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> Bombay) must be deducted from the land revenue of 1877, and L807,102 (the revenue of Kabul) from the land revenue of Akbar.

There was but one thing in which he saw a very unusual effect. He noticed that his passage was not stopped by trees or other objects. He appeared to walk directly through them. They were, in fact, but the souls or shadows of material trees. He became sensible that he was in a land of shadows. When he had traveled <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a day's journey, through a country which was continually becoming more attractive, he came to the banks of a broad lake, in the center of which was a large and beautiful island. He found a canoe of shining white stone, tied to the shore. He was now sure that he had taken the right path, for the aged man had told him this. There were also shining paddles. He immediately entered the canoe, and took the paddles in his hands, when, to his joy and surprise, on turning round he beheld...", "...on the instruments and levers. At two hours and a half Harper reached for a button and withdrew his hand in abrupt hesitation. Then it darted out again and pressed decisively. At three hours he was making two such hesitations every cycle. \"Not so good,\" Barker commented. \"Not for a man who battles himself the way Harper does.\" Nat Holt remained silent, watching critically the wavering dials and graphs showing the engineer's physical condition and reaction. At four and a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> hours, Harper's hand reached for a lever in the center of the board. But it didn't get more than a third of the way. In mid-air it froze, as if paralysis had suddenly struck it. Harper regarded it in seeming dumb astonishment. His face grew red, and sweat broke out upon his forehead as if from the physical exertion of trying to put his hand to the lever. Paul grabbed a microphone and switched it on. \"Touch the lever,\" he commanded. \"Draw it toward you.\" Harper looked around...", "...for the evening?\" \"Grease\" means good standing on the conduct report. \"Yes,\" nodded Dave. \"Danny and I could easily get town leave, if we had a good excuse.

It was not until the _fete_ was over that one evening he resolved to pay a visit there. He did not, however, announce his intention openly, but went there in strict secrecy, making his way to the house unobserved, as there was no one about. On his arrival he went up to the latticed window and peeped through. The curtains were old and <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> worn out, yet were still left to hang in the once pretty and decorated chamber. There were a few domestic maidens there partaking of supper. The table and service seemed to be old Chinese, but everything else betrayed a scantiness of furniture.

There was a specimen of the female bird in the Museum of the Mechanics' Institution, but I am not sure about its history, and I have some reason to suppose it was shot in Jersey.

Wolska, with closed eyes, stood beside the piano, nervously tugged at the golden lace of her waist and, groaning with painful anxiety, counted in her mind the number of copecks which her partner placed together with the notes beside her. The pianist again struck the keys and Wolska and her partner began to sing together some comic couplets, interwoven with a kind of \"Krakowiak\" which they danced in a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> dreamy manner. Janina could hardly wait for the end of the performance and, without saying anything about the impression that that drinking den had made on her, she took leave of Wolska and fairly ran away from that garden, that public, and that degradation.

The charm of the courtyard, with the flower-beds and floral designs, died away; we were now pleased to keep indoors and allow the chairs outside to stand idle. All day long the enemy shelled us, most of the shells dropped outside and played havoc with the church; but the figure (p. 160) on the crucifix still remained, a symbol of something great and tragical, overlooking the area of destruction and death. Now and again a shell dropped on the flower-beds and...", "...30th of June we halted at the village of Sab. We here crossed the great river Sab by means of rafts, the mode of constructing which is certainly very ancient. They consist of leathern bottles, filled with air, fastened together with poles, and covered with planks, reeds, and rushes. Our raft had twenty-eight wind-bags, was seven feet broad, nearly as long, and carried two horse-loads and six men. As our caravan numbered thirty-two loaded animals, the crossing of the river occupied <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a day. Four or five of the animals were tied together and drawn over by a man seated across an air-bag. The weaker animals, such as the donkeys, had a bag half filled with air tied on their backs. The night of the 30th of June, the last of our journey, was one of the most wearisome: we travelled eleven hours. About half-way, we came to the river Hasar, called Gaumil by the Greeks, and made remarkable by the passage of Alexander the Great. It was broad, but not deep, and we...", "...Since that time, the pressure on the money market has prevented any general effort to obtain subscriptions, but a city pastor has subscribed..............................$150 A sister of the First Baptist Church.....100 Bro.

This doubt, was, however, quickly resolved, as his eyes fell upon the floor, where a small fragment of a lace dress lay, as it was caught and torn off in the closing door.

It was but momentary, or he could have persuaded himself that she looked on him with an air the most tender and compassionate. Never did fancy portray her in a form so lovely.

Not all the realities, all the blandishments that woman ever displayed, even the most resistless, could have wrought <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> so dexterously or gained such swift access to the heart. The vision faded, and a momentary darkness ensued. Suddenly a blaze of light irradiated the apartment. Rodolf beheld, for one short glimpse, a Gothic hall.

A new and overwhelming emotion had overpowered him. It arose with the speed...", "...as he said he could not trust them to any one but himself.

As the party rode through the town, they were struck with the narrowness and straightness of the streets, and at the generally European look of everything; and Mr. Thompson told them that nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> the population of Buenos Ayres are European. The number of people upon horseback also surprised our young travellers; but horses cost only thirty shillings or two pounds, and grass is so abundant that the expense of their food is next to nothing; consequently every one rides,--even shepherds look after their sheep on horseback. The horses seemed very quiet, for in front of most of the offices the horses of the merchants could be seen fastened by a head rope to a ring, grooms not...", "...heavier curse could I invoke on her Than that she see him in her dreams, her thoughts, As he is now.

Your confession came at just the psychological moment. The girl's unspoken demand there in the poplars was that he free McTrigger, and it was backed up by a threat which Kedsty understood and which terrified him to his marrow. McTrigger must have seen him afterward, for he waited at the office until Kedsty came. I don't know what passed between them. Constable Doyle says they were together for <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> an hour. Then McTrigger walked out of barracks, and no one has seen him since. It's mighty queer.

You have her ready for me to-morrow night, or you go to prison--which you please.\" The old woman shivered at the word magistrate, and fell trembling on her knees....", "...(if he knew anything of his personal history) even venture to declare the past. The caution with which he usually touched the second subject, formed a striking contrast with the positive declarations concerning the first.

She is at the table where the picture is. There won't be much danger of its selling at once for one hundred dollars, and we can trust Frances to head any one off who pretends to wish to buy it.\" So it was as a result of this plan of Belle's that Frances had prevented a sale of the picture to Madame du Launy. For at that time Brenda and Belle had a number of names on their books, enough in fact to represent one <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> the valuation of the picture. Each girl who voted was bound to secrecy, for Belle realized (though she had put it in a different light to Brenda) that she was violating the spirit, if not the letter of Mrs. Blair's command.

But in the desert a man does not disturb himself about such trifles. An enormous...", "...my peace, and devoutly thank the Lord that times had changed for the better. For a great deal of that change I had to thank my dear girl, so much more clever and tactful than I. And so I would not cloud her last days with me by letting her see that I was unhappy. Only, I was glad this afternoon to be by myself for a breathing-space. It rests one's face occasionally to take off one's smile. I took off mine, then, and let down the corners of my mouth.

One report is, that our particular command will help to chase the Russians to Mukden, while...", "...the elimination of unsuccessful candidates shall proceed? The number of votes necessary to secure the election of a candidate is called the \"quota.\" At first sight it would seem that this number should be ascertained, as suggested in the preceding paragraphs, by dividing the number of votes by the number of vacancies. But a smaller proportion is sufficient. Thus, in a single-member constituency a candidate has no need to poll all the votes; it is evident that if he polls more than a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> he must be elected. No other candidate can equal him; the quota in this case is, therefore, one more than a half. So, in a two-member constituency the quota is one more than a third, for not more than two candidates can poll so much; in a three-member constituency, one more than a fourth, and so on. In a seven-member constituency, like that of Birmingham, the quota would be one more than an eighth. In general terms the quota is ascertained by dividing the votes polled by one more...", "...with insect poison. Stanley, the Professor and a Zyobite came up in the rear with their three hoses.

It has been computed by those who are competent to judge, that about three-quarters of the ship letters are written by emigrants, and are letters of friendship and affection. The greater portion of them are from persons in poor circumstances, and to tax them with _twenty-four_ or _twenty-nine_ cents for a single letter is cruel.

The ingratitude of Mr. Silk was a rebuff to a nature which was at that moment overflowing with good will. For a moment the steward was <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> inclined to let him go home alone, but the reflection that he would never get there softened him. \"Pull yourself t'gether,\" he said, gravely, \"Now, 'old on me.\" The road, as they walked, rose up in imitation of the shipping, but Mr. Wilks knew now the explanation: Teddy Silk was intoxicated. Very gently he leaned towards the erring youth and wagged his head at him. \"Are you going to hold up or aren't you?\" demanded Mr. Silk, shortly. The steward waived the question; he knew...", "...towards Bonaventure he smelt the wind of home in his nostrils; his hatchet head jerked till he got the bit straight between his teeth; then, gripping it as a fretful dog clamps the bone which his master pretends to wrest from him, he leaned down to his work, and the mud, the new-fallen snow and the slush flew like dirty sparks, and covered man and horse.

The horse neither turned head nor slackened gait. He was like a living machine, obeying neither call nor spur, but travelling with an unchanging speed along the level road, and up and down hill, mile after mile.

His secretary was just like a new toy to him, offering many of the advantages of official life and routine without any of the drawbacks. At <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> past eleven he descended, wearing one or two of the more discreet of his new possessions, and with the sensation of having already transacted a good day's work, into the breakfast-room and found Miss Warburton and Machin in converse.

There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour. But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They...", "...X. from time to time repaired, and reproduced as far as possible the conditions which obtained on the night of the murder. He had the same stifling fire, the same locked door. The latch was dropped in its socket, whilst T. X., with a stop watch in his hand, made elaborate calculations and acted certain parts which he did not reveal to a soul. Three times, accompanied by Mansus, he went to the house, three times went to the death chamber and was alone on one occasion for an hour and a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> whilst the patient Mansus waited outside. Three times he emerged looking graver on each occasion, and after the third visit he called into consultation John Lexman.

Leaving behind him the huts abandoned by the coiners, he continued all night and all day his solitary flight. At last, almost ready to expire with hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and not knowing if God was still far from him, he came to a silent city which extended from right to left, and stretched away till it was lost in the blue horizon. The buildings, which were widely separated and like each other, resembled pyramids cut off at <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> their height. They were tombs. The doors were broken, and in the shadow of the chambers could be seen the gleaming eyes of hyaenas and wolves who brought forth their young there, whilst the dead bodies lay on the threshold, despoiled by robbers, and gnawed by the wild beasts. Having passed through this funeral city, Paphnutius fell exhausted before a tomb which stood near a spring surrounded by palm trees. This tomb was much ornamented, and, as there was no door to it, he saw...", "...that the men appreciated to the full what was represented by chocolate cake in this altitude of tiny stoves and scanty supplies.

And when it was not blowing with hurricane strength it was usually just the opposite: a flat calm, with a black, lowering, overcast sky, moist, steamy, overpowering heat, heavy storms of thunder and lightning, torrential downpours of tepid rain--which, by the way, enabled us to re-fill all our water tanks and casks--and waterspouts _ad libitum_ constantly threatening us with destruction.

This territory could not support a population until transportation facilities were provided for carrying in the necessary lumber, fuel, and supplies, and carrying away the agricultural products as the land should become cultivated. The price of the land at private entry was then $1.25 per acre. The government gave <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of the lands within the land grant limits to the railroads and immediately advanced the price on the even sections to $2.50 per acre, not only getting the same amount of money for the same acreage, but making sales of the government land much more rapidly.

And His Highness has already dined with him in private. \"Besides this, Signor Lodovico read us a letter which the Pope had written with his own hand to Monsignore Ascanio, complaining that he had not seen him for <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a day, a period which seemed to him more like a thousand years, and begging him to come to him at once, since he had many things of the utmost importance to settle with him. After describing this interview, the said Monsignore went on to tell how warmly His Holiness spoke of Signor Lodovico, saying that he was determined to maintain the most cordial relations with His Highness, and profit in all cases by his advice, and only wished that he were seated in his chair.

Hence if a workman had accomplished in a full normal _time_ labour-day, either one and a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> times the amount, or only half the amount of normal work, he would _e.g._ in the six hours mining day, for six hours work, be credited with a day and a half, or half a day respectively of normal work time; whilst in spinning and weaving, on the other hand, he would in the same way, for 12 hours work, be credited with one and a half or a half-day respectively of normal work time.

But the blind terror of her horse, who swerved at every sweep of the surge, shamed her own <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> superstitious fears, and with the effort to control his alarm she regained her own self-possession, albeit with eyelashes wet not altogether with the salt spray from the sea. This was followed by a reaction, perhaps stimulated by her victory over the beaten animal, when for a time, she knew not how long, she felt only a mad sense of freedom and power, oblivious of even her sorrows, her lost home and husband, and with intense feminine consciousness she longed to be a man.

On the following night this was repeated under a heavy, soaking rain. I collected upwards of fifteen hundred fire-arms, of which more than <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> were those of the Rebels. There were rifles, muskets and carbines; also bayonets, swords, belts and cartridge boxes. The arms were rusty from having lain on the field during several days' rain.

In the course of a year, Law's notes rose to fifteen per cent premium, while the _billets d'etat_, or notes issued by the government as security for the debts contracted by the extravagant Louis XIV., were at a discount of no less than seventy-eight and a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> per cent. The comparison was too great in favour of Law not to attract the attention of the whole kingdom, and his credit extended itself day by day. Branches of his bank were almost simultaneously established at Lyons, Rochelle, Tours, Amiens, and Orleans.

Those beautiful days of fear and hope, of discouragement and confidence, are as vividly before my eyes as if they were now. I see again the Constanzi Theatre, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> filled; I see how, after the last excited measures of the orchestra, they all raise their arms and gesticulate, as if they were threatening me; and in my soul there awakens an echo of that cry of approval which almost prostrated me.

Six inches from one end a piece of wood is nailed across three inches high. The whole is tarred over, but the old warder drew our attention to the fact that, though the cell where it is kept is very dry, the wood is still in places damp. It is a gaol tradition that the blood of these unhappy men shed in 1817 has never and will never dry.\" On May 1st, 1820, the Cato Street Conspirators were, after...", "...make that use of them. I have known many people, from laziness of mind, go through both pleasure and business with equal inattention; neither enjoying the one, nor doing the other; thinking themselves men of pleasure, because they were mingled with those who were, and men of business, because they had business to do, though they did not do it. Whatever you do, do it to the purpose; do it thoroughly, not superficially. 'Approfondissez': go to the bottom of things. Any thing half done or <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> known, is, in my mind, neither done nor known at all. Nay worse, it often misleads. There is hardly any place or any company, where you may not gain knowledge, if you please; almost everybody knows some one thing, and is glad to talk upon that one thing. Seek and you will find, in this world as well as in the next. See everything; inquire into everything; and you may excuse your curiosity, and the questions you ask which otherwise might be thought impertinent, by your manner of...", "...ventilators on the principle of this kitchener, there is undoubtedly a peculiar taste, which does not at all equal the flavour developed by roasting meat.

Springing up then I attacked the bars at the window. Hours and hours I labored, impelled to greater effort by the dread of spending another night in that room of murder. I was patient, too, patient with the cunning of a maniac. The dagger made my chisel; my sword, wrapped in a cloth to muffle the strokes, furnished me a maul.

He found the pair fast asleep under a tree, so he filled his pockets with stones and climbed up into the branches over their heads. Then he began to pelt one of the giants with the missiles, until after a few minutes one of the men awoke. Giving the other a rough push, he cried: \"If you strike me like that again, I'll know the reason why.\" \"I didn't touch you,\" said the other giant crossly, and they were...", "...for the man would not let us. The annoying part was that his General, who had a tent somewhere near, was that very man who tried to bully me in the Hospital.

After some minutes, word was brought back that the General was asleep! \"Wake the devil, then!\" I shouted, for I was burning and aching with fever, and we had been waiting already <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> an hour. They did not dare to, they said. The sentry communed within himself, and presently said that, as I had attended him in a severe illness and had given him good medicine and made him well, he would therefore risk punishment for my sake and let me pass. He hesitated about letting the Armenian and soldier go by too, but finally yielded, on its being explained to him how impossible it was for me to travel alone. I never heard that he was punished.

Broughton (1762-1821), who gave them the name of Chatham from the brig which he commanded. He described the natives as a bright, pleasure-loving people, dressed in sealskins or mats, and calling themselves Morioris or Maiorioris. In 1831 they were conquered by 800 Maoris who were landed from a European vessel. They were almost exterminated, and an epidemic of influenza in 1839 killed <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of those left; ten years later there were only 90 survivors out of a total population of 1200. They subsequently decreased still further. Their language was allied to that of the Maoris of New Zealand, but they differed somewhat from them in physique, and they were probably a cross between an immigrating Polynesian group and a lower indigenous Melanesian stock. The population of the islands includes about 200 whites of various races and the same number of natives (chiefly Maoris)....", "...Jardiniere.= Proceed exactly as for the foregoing, and serve on a macedoine of vegetables (Art. 416). 182. =Smoked Beef's Tongue, Wine Sauce with Mushrooms.= Soak a smoked tongue in water the night before it is needed.

As we learned afterward, our new leader fancied he had cause for enmity against the two gentlemen whom our sentinels had taken prisoners, and within <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> an hour after they were brought into camp, he ordered both tied to a tree and severely whipped. It was an outrage which cannot be excused, however partial one may feel toward that organization which first nourished the spirit of liberty among the American people.

These various annoyances produced a great change in poor Piggy, who, perhaps, felt more deeply the overthrow of his pet projects, than the actual loss his bargain had entailed on him; though the loss itself was not trifling, for Bruin's enormous appetite, which he indulged to a frightful extent, went considerably beyond the income that his diminished exertions produced, and there was a...", "...Is it a great novel, or was it only an event of an era of agitation and passion?

Richard was going to repeat the...", "...in his. \"I could not return to New York without seeing you again,\" said Mr. Emerson, as he stood holding the hand of Irene. \"We met so briefly, and were thrown apart again so suddenly, that some things I meant to say were left unspoken.\" He led her to a seat and sat down beside her, still looking intently in her face. Irene was far from being as calm as when they sat together the day before. A world of new hopes had sprung up in her heart since then. She had lain half asleep and <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> awake nearly all night, in a kind of delicious dream, from which the morning awoke her with a cold chill of reality. She had dreamed again since the sun had risen; and now the dream was changing into the actual. \"Have I done wrong in this, Irene?\" he asked. And she answered, \"No, it is a pleasure to meet you, Hartley.\" She had passed through years of self-discipline, and the power acquired during this time came to her aid. And so she was able to answer with womanly...", "...herd at Nutwood, but at Willow Bend his famous Short-horns, red, and red roan, roamed over pasturage extending hundreds of acres.

In a green cup encircled by wimpling hills the overseer's home nestled like a white bird hovering to drink. The sharply curving creek that divided it from the plantation was bridged a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> mile below the mill, and a dense growth of trees and vines clothed the banks. In an opposite direction, beyond the house, and mantling the upland slopes, lay fields of grain, glistening as the wind crinkled the yellowing folds. Locust and china trees, overrun by English honeysuckle, coral, and buff woodbine, shaded the cottage, and all about the spring house clustered azaleas--white, pink, orange, scarlet--filling the quiet hollow with waves of incomparable perfume. Hanging on...", "...the _Amoeba_ draws in all of its pseudopodia and remains dormant for a time. Next, certain changes take place in the nucleus, which divides into equal portions, one part withdrawing to one end of the protoplasmic body, the other to the opposite end. Soon the body protoplasm itself begins to divide into two parts, each part collecting about its own half of the nucleus. Finally the two halves pull entirely away from each other and form two new _Amoebae_, each like the original, but only <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> as large. This is the simplest kind of reproduction found among animals. _Amoebae_ continue to live and multiply as long as the conditions surrounding them are favorable. But when the pond dries up the _Amoebae_ in it would be exterminated were it not for a careful provision of nature. When the pond begins to dry up each _Amoeba_ contracts its pseudopodia and the protoplasm secretes a horny capsule about itself. It is now protected from dry weather and can be blown by the winds...", "...MS. accounts of Mr. Chevallier, of Aspall Hall.

The history of English agriculture in the latter <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of the eighteenth century has been so well described by Arthur Young that any account of it at that time must largely be an epitome of his writings. The greatest of English writers on agriculture was born in 1741, and began farming early; but, as he confesses himself, was a complete failure. When he was twenty-six he took a farm of 300 acres at Samford Hall in Essex, and after five years of it paid a farmer L100 to take it off his hands, who thereupon made a fortune out of it. He...", "...the bags of spice, and pour on the vinegar hot, an equal portion in each jar. While warm, secure them with flat corks, and tie leather over them.

From one pocket she pulled out a paper parcel, from the other a bunch of big, heavy keys, which she put down so carelessly that the sleeping man started and opened his eyes. For some time he looked blankly round him as though he didn't know where he was, then he shook his head, went to the corner and sat down. . . . The newcomer took off her great coat, which made her shrink to <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> her size again, she took off her big felt boots, and sat down, too. By now she no longer resembled a bundle: she was a thin little brunette of twenty, as slim as a snake, with a long white face and curly hair. Her nose was long and sharp, her chin, too, was long and sharp, her eyelashes were long, the corners of her mouth were sharp, and, thanks to this general sharpness, the expression of her face was biting.

He certainly looked strangely weird in the semi-darkness with his lanky hair plastered against his cheeks, his collar <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> torn from round his neck, the dripping, oily substance flowing in rivulets from his garments down upon the ground. The girl had no longer any desire to laugh, and when Master Busy strode majestically across the rustic bridge, then over the garden paths to the kitchen quarter of the house, she followed him without a word, awed by his extraordinary utterances, vaguely feeling that in his dripping garments he somehow reminded her of Jonah and the whale.

The path to-day lay among huge boulders of rock, which had come down as specimens from the mountains above, and after a short march of five kos, we reached Dras, a little assemblage of flat-roofed houses, with a mud fort about <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a mile from it, in the valley. This was built with four bastions and a ditch scarped with paving-stones, which surrounded it on all sides except one, where it was naturally defended by the torrent. On the road we passed a curious bridge, built entirely of rope manufactured from twigs of trees. The cables thus formed were swung across the torrent, from piles of loose stones, in a most scientific way, though not one calculated to inspire confidence in any traveller with weak nerves...", "...High up above the bed was the mouthpiece of what looked like a motor horn. This and an iron ventilating register let into the wall a couple of feet away from the pillow were the only objects that provided any variety in the way of decoration.

There was no vitality in the air--it breathed mossy and damp. \"Do with an open window,\" said Richard and moved toward the shutters. He had hardly covered <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> the distance when the lights went out with startling suddenness. There was something distinctly eerie in the absolute darkness in which he found himself. He stretched out a hand and felt for the nearest wall like a blind man, groped his way to the door and opened it. But the other room was also in pitchy blackness. \"Fuse gone somewhere,\" he conjectured. \"May as well try and get to a chair and wait till the lights come on.\" Roughly memorising the position of the furniture...", "...vociferation and caricature. Observe the figure of old Silenus, on preceding page, one of the chief mirth-makers of antiquity, who lives for us in the Old Man of the pantomime. He is masked for the theatre. The legend of Silenus is itself an evidence of the tendency of the ancients to fall into caricature. To the Romans he was at once the tutor, the comrade, and the butt of jolly Bacchus. He discoursed wisdom and made fun. He was usually represented as an old man, bald, flat-nosed, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> drunk, riding upon a broad-backed ass, or reeling along by the aid of a staff, uttering shrewd maxims and doing ludicrous acts. People wonder that the pantomime called \"Humpty Dumpty\" should be played a thousand nights in New York; but the substance of all that boisterous nonsense, that exhibition of rollicking freedom from restraints of law, usage, and gravitation, has amused mankind for unknown thousands of years; for it is merely what remains to us of the legendary Bacchus and...", "...to her consort on the 21st of December, the two vessels exchanging a parting salute.

A sound, half a groan, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a sob, coming from the door, aroused her. There stood a lady, in a crushed bonnet and unwholesome stuff gown that had once been black, with a red face, and a perfume of strong waters around her. Maria rose from the sofa, her heart sinking.

Under this plan the better men gradually but surely slow down their gait to that of the poorest and least efficient. When a naturally energetic man works for a few days beside a lazy one, the logic of the situation is unanswerable: \"Why should I work hard when that lazy fellow gets the same pay that I do and does only <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> as much work?\" A careful time study of men working under these conditions will disclose facts which are ludicrous as well as pitiable. To illustrate: The writer has timed a naturally energetic workman who, while going and coming from work, would walk at a speed of from three to four miles per hour, and not infrequently trot home after a day's work. On arriving at his work he would immediately slow down to a speed of about one mile an hour.

It was ultimately determined to lay it out in the purchase of a piece of land in Titchmarsh field, the rents and profits of which continue to be received towards the support of the minister for the time being.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of this sum was expended in the enclosure of the land at Titchmarsh, and the other half was applied towards the building of the new Meeting House. Some years after, the dwelling-house was again purchased for the residence of the minister, when they had a settled pastor at Weldon.

But we are justified in blaming the ecclesiastical and civil authorities of the Counter-Reformation for their determined opposition to the new direction which that old enthusiasm for the classics was now manifesting.

The administration of such a man would probably have been characterized by an accommodating spirit which would have carried on the traditions of Monroe. In the career of Calhoun are strikingly exhibited the changing characteristics of the south in this era. His grandfather was a Scotch-Irishman who came to Pennsylvania with the emigration of that people in the first <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of the eighteenth century, and thence followed the stream of settlement that passed up the Great Valley and into South Carolina to the frontier, from which men like Daniel Boone crossed the mountains to the conquest of Kentucky and Tennessee.

The foregoing explanation will show how it came about that all down the long, swift descent, Rachel, breathless with the unaccustomed delight of the flight, felt upon her cheek a warm breath, and was conscious of a most extraordinary nearness of the lips which kept saying merry things into her ear. The ear itself grew warm before the bottom of the track was reached. \"That was a great coast,\" cried the doctor as they reached the end of the long...", "...of the audience--to teach them, to turn them, and to form them, till the orator shall be made to appear exactly that which he wishes to be thought.[260] * * * The man who listens to one who is an orator believes what he hears; he thinks everything to be true, he approves of all.\"[261] No doubt! In his power of describing the orator and his work Cicero is perfect; but he does not describe the man doing that which he is bound to do by his duty. He tells us that nothing is worse than <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a dozen advocates--which certainly is true.[262] Further on he comes to Caesar, and praises him very highly. But here Brutus is made to speak, and tells us how he has read the Commentaries, and found them to be \"bare in their beauty, perfect in symmetry, but unadorned, and deprived of all outside garniture.\"[263] They are all that he has told us, nor could they have been described in truer words.

This increased her agony, but the medicine-man declared he had \"got it,\" and held his hands to his mouth. After this he plunged his hands into a bowl of water, leaving the spectators to believe that he had torn out the disease with his teeth, and was now destroying it by drowning. Eventually he withdrew his hand from the bowl, and it was found that he held a piece of cartilage between the finger and thumb.

So ended the operation, and Mr. Kane records that though the doctor was perfectly satisfied, the patient seemed, if anything, to be worse for the treatment.

And if there was to be an attack along the Isonzo front--which they doubted--they believed that it would almost certainly develop in the Monfalcone sector, next the sea. And of this belief the Italians took care not to disabuse them. Here again was exemplified the vital necessity of having control of the air. If, during the latter <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of July, the Austrian fliers had been able to get over the Italian lines, they could not have failed to observe the enormous preparations which were in progress, and when the Italians advanced, the Austrians would have been ready for them.

Another method of dodging the cut is to take the half of the pack which should finally be on the top, but which the sharp desires to be underneath, holding it by the thumb and three last fingers of the right hand, with the forefinger bent, and its back resting upon the back of the top card. The cards, being thus removed from the table, are now held entirely by the forefinger and the other three, the thumb being taken away. The second <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> of the pack is now taken up between the thumb and forefinger; at the same instant, the other cards being slipped underneath instead of on top as they should be. Skilfully and quickly done, this plan is very deceptive, as such things go.

Isaac Bernays belonged to this school. To his vision Judaism in its literature and historical progress revealed itself <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> unveiled. Bernays' mind, with its overflowing wealth of ideas, found in all phenomena the harmonious systemization and development of a fundamental thought, which to manifest all its latent possibilities permeated passing events and historical achievements, and which had developed from the beginning of creation to the most recent fact.

At the point where it turned it was not two hundred yards ahead of the canoe.

In case of an accident the father will inherit <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> the money from his son; and if it seems cruel for an own father to inherit from his own son, it is quite a different thing when it is a stranger who receives the fortune. This is all, my dear sir, plainly and frankly, and I will not do you the injury to suppose that you do not see the advantages of what I have said to you without need of my insisting further. If I have not explained clearly,\" \"But nothing is more clear.\" \"--it is the fault of this pain that paralyzes me.\"...", "...you, dear; that you are still mine, my Margaret, my Madge--little Madge, that found me a home that day I came to New York; my pretty Madge, that cried when I was going to leave on Ned's account; that I loved the first moment I saw her, and--always--\" He broke down at this, and leaned forward upon the table, covering his face with his hands. When he next looked up, with haggard countenance, he saw her lips twitching and tears in her eyes. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, with a flash of hope, and <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> rose to go to her. \"No, no! Let me alone!\" she cried, escaping narrowly from that surrender to her feelings which would have meant forfeiting the fruits of her long planning. His mood changed. \"I'll not endure this,\" he cried, rising and pacing the floor. \"You'll find I'm no such weakling, though I can weep for my wife when I lose her love. _He_ shall find it so, too! I understand now what you meant by 'to-night of all nights.' He was to meet you to-night. He's quartered...", "...of his position, Code could not but admire the brilliance of such a scheming brain, while at the same time deploring that it was not employed in some legitimate and profitable cause. Now he was in the enemy's hands, and St. Andrew's was less than a dozen hours away; St. Andrew's, with its jail, its grand jury, and its pen. Life aboard the _Nettie B._ had been a dead monotony. On the foremast above Code's prison hung the bell that rang the watches, so that the passage of every <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> hour was dinged into his ears. Three times a day he was given food, and twice a day he was allowed to pace up and down the deck, a man holding tightly to each arm. The weather had been propitious, with a moderate sea and a good quartering wind. The _Nettie_ had footed it properly, and Code's experienced eye had, on one occasion, seen her log her twelve knots in an hour. The fact had raised his estimation of her fifty per cent. It must not be supposed that, as Code sat in his...", "...if I liked to get letters. Which led, quite accidentally, to my asking leave to write to her. She replied that she did not mean that. Nevertheless, I insisted, would she? She only bent lower still. I asked the third time; and with nothing but the parting of her hair for me to look at, she nodded, and one of her braids fell over in front, and I took the pink-ribboned live end of it timorously between thumb and finger and felt as if I had hold of an electric battery. She backed <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> a step, and quite needlessly I let it go. Then she bade me not forget I had promised her the words of a certain song. \"Want them? Indeed, yes! Did you not say it was an unpublished song written by a messmate of yours?--oh, Mr. Smith! I see why you stammer! You said 'a member of your mess'! oh!--oh!--oh!--you wrote it, yourself! And you wrote it to-day! That explains--\" She drew an awesome breath, rose to her toes and knit her knuckles under her throat. I was in the sweetest...", "...rained nearly all day. From the 6th to the 12th, clear and pleasant, being slightly foggy in the mornings; from 13th to 17th rained about half each day, and nearly all the night; 18th and 19th, cloudy without rain. The 20th and 21st, slight rain nearly all the time; 22d was cloudy; 23d and 24th, rain about half of each day; 25th rained all day, 26th cloudy, without rain, 27th was rainy, some heavy showers; 28th was clear; 29th, 30th and 31st, were showery and blustering, raining about <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> the time, and foggy. The 1st of February was clear; 2d cloudy, 3d rainy; 4th and 5th were a little cloudy, but pleasant; 6th and 7th, a few slight showers; 8th and 9th rainy and quite cool; snow was seen on the lower peaks of the Coast range of mountains, but none in the valley. The 10th was cloudy, at night a little frost; 11th was rainy; 12th and 13th rained all the time; 14th and 15th were nearly clear, with light frosts. The weather remained clear until the 23rd, with light...", "...and civil, and in fact on all occasions out of the ordinary routine. The United States consul general at Shanghai gives the following account of the industry: There are no large factories; the crackers are made in small houses and in the shops where they are sold. In making them only the cheapest kind of straw paper is used for the body of the cracker. A little finer paper is used for the wrapper. A piece of straw paper, nine by thirty inches, will make twenty-one crackers an inch and a <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> long and a quarter inch in diameter. The powder is also of the cheapest grade, and is made in the locality where used. It costs about six cents per pound. For the fuse a paper (called \"leather\" in Shanghai) is used, which is imported from Japan, and is made from the inner lining of the bamboo. In other places a fine rice paper is used, generally stiffened slightly with buckwheat-flour paste, which the Chinese say adds to its inflammability. A strip of this paper one third of an...", "...\"it'll be broad daylight before we know it, and then everybody we see will want to come along. The other fellows aren't on to the old dam yet this season. The fish are running early.\" He brought forth a basket with tackle and bait, dug over night. Ruth burdened herself with a big, square box, neatly wrapped and tied. Curly eyed this askance. \"I s'pose you expect to tear your clo'es and want something to wear back to town that's decent,\" he growled. \"Well, I want to look <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> way respectable,\" laughed Ruth, as they set forth. The damp smell of thawing earth greeted their nostrils as they left the house. No plowing had been done, save in very warm corners; but the lush buds on the trees and bushes, and the crocuses by the corner of the old house, promised spring. A clape called at them raucously as he rapped out his warning on a dead limb beside the road. A rabbit rose from its form and shot away into the dripping woods. The sun poked a jolly red...", "...her a spoonful of lemon juice with a little sugar, which cooled and eased her, so that after a dreadful half-hour passed she received this simple refreshment as a great enjoyment, that made her smile. \"Turn now towards the wall,\" said the commissioner, \"and pretend to sleep for five minutes while I go out and speak to your mother.\" The commissioner, who felt his powers failing, was obliged to go out into the fresh air to recover. And now he need only to throw a glance out over the <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> lighted evening sky, out over the steel blue sea, shut his eyes and try not to think, to feel, how the disordered, brain regained its place again and continued its accelerating motion forwards, after having been turned backwards awhile. While he stood thus with his arms on his chest, half asleep, he heard a thought still buzzing in one ear: a child of thirty-four years! Thus he awoke and went into the cottage again. Miss Mary was sitting on the sofa with her hair loosened...", "...to ask any more questions.\" Si went back to his cooking, with the Pediculus still on his arm. He wanted to show it to Shorty. The Captain's profound explanation, with its large words, was a little too much for Si. He did not yet clearly comprehend the matter, and as he walked thoughtfully to where Shorty was \"bilin'\" the coffee he was trying to get through his head what it all meant. \"Hello, Si,\" said Shorty; \"whar ye bin? What d'ye mean, goin' off 'n' leavin' yer sowbelly <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> done?\" \"Sh-h!\" replied Si. \"Ye needn't git yer back up about it. Bin talkin' to the Cap'n. Shorty, look at that 'ere bug!\" And Si pointed to the object of the Captain's lecture on natural history that was still creeping on his arm. Shorty slapped his thigh and burst into a loud laugh. \"Was that what ye went to see the Cap'n 'bout?\" he asked as soon as he could speak. \"Why--ya-as,\" replied Si, somewhat surprised at Shorty's unseemly levity. \"I saw that thing crawlin'...", "...his and crush out this strange agitation of hers, _forbid_ it to her? Then there was nothing in her but intense discomfort, as though that were a universe of its own. A low, distant growl of thunder shook the air with a muffled, muted roar. After a time, a little voice back of her announced in a low, cautious tone, \"Mother, it _works!_ Henry loves it!\" She turned her head and saw the little boy vigorously rubbing the ears and flanks of the pig, which stood perfectly still, its eyes <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> shut, rapt in a beatitude of satisfaction. Marise turned her head away and slid down lower on the grass, so that she lay with her face on her arm. She was shaking from head to foot as though with sobs. But she was not crying. She was laughing hysterically. \"Even for the pig!\" she was saying to herself. \"A symbol of my life!\" She lay there a long time after this nervous fit of laughter had stopped, till she heard Paul saying, \"There, I've put it on every inch of him.\" He added...", "...and the rushing to and fro of steamers, which it was thought would scare away those which remain, is becoming too familiar to be fearsome. Even in the narrow limits of Hinchinbrook Channel, through which the passing of steamers is of everyday occurrence, they still exist, though not in such numbers as in the early days. It would seem that the waters within the Great Barrier Reef may long continue one of the last resorts of this strange, uncouth, paradoxical mammal. Half hippopotamus, <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> seal, yet in no way related to either, something between a pachyderm and cetacean, the dugong is a herbivorous marine mammal, commonly known as \"the sea cow,\" because of its resemblance in some particulars to that useful domesticated animal. It grazes on marine grass (POSIDONIA AUSTRALIS), parts of the flesh very closely resemble beef, and post-mortem examination reveals internal structure similar in most details to those of its namesake. But, unlike the cow, the dugong has two...", "...and are _accented_, or _emphasized_.\"--P. 189. The word \"_after_\" here may be a misprint for the word _upon_; but no preposition really suits the connexion: the participle _impressing_ or _affecting_ would be better. Of _quantity_, this work gives the following account: \"The _quantity_ of a _syllable_ is that time which is required to pronounce it. A syllable may be _long_ or _short_. _Hate_ is long, as the vowel _a_ is elongated by the final _e_; _hat_ is short, and requires about <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> the time for pronunciation which is used for pronouncing _hate_. So of _ate, at; bate, bat; cure, cur_. Though unaccented syllables are usually short, yet _many_ of those which are accented are short also. The following are short: _ad_vent, _sin_ner, _sup_per. In the following, the unaccented syllables are long: al_so_, ex_ile_, gan_grene_, um_pire_. It maybe remarked, that the quantity of a syllable is short when the accent is on a consonant; as, art, bonnet, hunger. The _hyphen_...", "...add two quarts of stock, or broth from the Pot-au-feu, a tablespoonful of sugar, and a little pepper and salt, if required; boil all well together five minutes, when rub it through a tammy or hair sieve; then put it into another stewpan, with a pint of boiling milk; boil five minutes, skim well, and pour it into your tureen.

Between the young monarch of twenty-two and Thomas, as a favorite of Theobald and as Archdeacon of Canterbury, an intimacy sprang up. Henry II. was the most powerful sovereign of Western Europe, since he was not only King of England, but had inherited in France Anjou and Touraine from his father, and Normandy and Maine from his mother. By his marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, he gained seven other provinces as her dower. The dominions of Louis were not <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> so great as his, even in France. And Henry was not only a powerful sovereign by his great territorial possessions, but also for his tact and ability. He saw the genius of Becket and made him his chancellor, loading him with honors and perquisites and Church benefices. The power of Becket as chancellor was very great, since he was prime minister, and the civil administration of the kingdom was chiefly intrusted to him, embracing nearly all the functions now performed by the...", "...was so very characteristic, and so entirely peculiar to the subject in hand, that I cannot omit it. That report was simply a rumor that I had caused one of my own barns to be set on fire, the second night of my arrival, in order to throw the odium of the act on those \"virtuous and hard-working husbandmen,\" who only maintained an illegal and armed body on foot, just to bully and worry me out of my property. Yes, there I sat; altogether unconscious of the honor done me; regarded by quite <span class=\"clocktext\">half</span> that congregation as the respected and just-minded youth who had devised and carried out precisely such a rascally scheme. Now no one who has not had the opportunity to compare, can form any idea how much more potent and formidable is the American \"folks say,\" than the vulgar reports of any other state of society. The French _on dit_ is a poor, pitiful report, placed by the side of this vast lever, which, like that of Archimedes, only wants a stand for its fulcrum, to move the..."]
