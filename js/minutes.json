["...removed from our lives, it would be possible for the weakest man to live well. It was the fact that, trusting in God, he took no thought for the morrow, which enabled Jesus to become Christ. Gliding round the island, they came to a sandy cove, which faced the sunset. There they landed. Lifting the canoe a dozen paces up the shore and placing it in the scrub, where it might be out of sight, they struck into the brushwood by a narrow trail, which at once commenced to climb. After three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of travelling, they came out on to a tall bare rock, to one side of which grew a solitary pine. From there they could command a view of the river on every side. Granger settled himself down, with his back toward his companion, propping himself against the pine-trunk, with his face towards the fading light. The huskies gathered hungrily round in a semicircle, squatting on their haunches, wondering whether the coming of these men meant that they were going to be fed. The frogs...", "...we were fit for a fight so soon as it might come. It came sooner than we expected. The cry of \"Sail ho!\" woke me early one morning. It was the 10th of September. The enemy was coming. Sails were sticking out of the misty dawn a few miles away. In a moment our decks were black and noisy with the hundred and two that manned the vessel. It was every hand to rope and windlass then. Sails went up with a snap all around us, and the creak of blocks sounded far and near. In twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we were under way, leading the van to battle. The sun came up, lighting the great towers of canvas. Every vessel was now feeling for the wind, some with oars and sweeps to aid them. A light breeze came out of the southwest. Perry stood near me, his hat in his hand. He was looking back at the Niagara. \"Run to the leeward of the islands,\" said he to the sailing-master. \"Then you 'll have to fight to the leeward,\" said the latter. \"Don't care, so long as we fight,\" said...", "...are six of those great footmen. What on earth shall I do with them all\"-- \"Sack them,\" said Eustace, abruptly; \"the sight of those overfed brutes makes me sick!\" And then they were bowed in--and under the close scrutiny of many pairs of eyes, wandered off with what dignity they could command to dress for dinner. In due course they found themselves at dinner, and such a dinner! It took an hour and twenty minutes to get through, or rather the six footmen took an hour and twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to carry the silver dishes in and out. Never since their marriage had Eustace and Augusta, felt so miserable. \"I don't think that I like being so rich,\" said Augusta rising and coming down the long table to her husband, when at last Johnson had softly closed the door. \"It oppresses me!\" \"So it does me,\" said Eustace; \"and I tell you what it is, Gussie,\" he went on, putting his arm round her, \"I won't stand having all these infernal fellows hanging round me. I shall sell...", "...red glow lay in the midst of the moonlight, with occasional tongues of lurid flame lazily lapping at some smouldering upright. The fire had spent its force; gorged itself on its prey and was sinking to sleep. \"Come on then!\" said Harris, speaking for the first time impetuously. \"If you can't stand the pace let us shove ahead!\" \"And run slap into ambush? No. My orders are to move with caution. We've got to _feel_ our way now.

Barely fifty minutes thereafter, and with less than three miles more to their credit, halted for cautious reconnaissance, with the ruined ranch still a long mile away, there came sound of feeble hail from a patch of willows down by the brookside, and presently, in fearful plight, they dragged forth Bennett's colored man-of-all-work, unharmed, but half dead with terror.

Through that pit of death David stumbled with the Girl. The fresh air struck their faces. The sun of day fell upon them. The green grass and the flowers of the mountain were under their feet. They looked down the slope, and saw, disappearing over the crest of the _coulee_, two men who were running for their lives. CHAPTER XXVII It may have been five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> that David held the Girl in his arms, staring down into the sunlit valley into which the last two of Hauck's men had fled, and during that time he did not speak, and he heard only her steady sobbing. He drew into his lungs deep breaths of the invigorating air, and he felt himself growing stronger as the Girl's body became heavier in his embrace, and her arms relaxed and slipped down from his shoulders. He raised her face. There were no tears in her eyes, but she was still...", "...at the end, and here she was introduced to her new mistress, the lady-superintendent. She was a small, well-formed woman of about thirty, with a pale thin face, lightish brown hair, grey eyes, and thinnish lips. She also was dressed in uniform, but with a precision and grace which showed that though the material might be the same as that used by her underlings, it was made up at the West End. She was evidently born to command, as little women often are. It was impossible to be five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in her company without being affected by her domination. Her very clothes felt it, for not a rebellious wrinkle or crease dared to show itself. The nurses came to her almost every moment for directions, which were given with brevity and clearness, and obeyed with the utmost deference. The furniture was like that of a yacht, very compact, scrupulously clean, and very handy. There was a complete apparatus for instantaneously making tea, a luxurious little armchair specially...", "...until 5 a.m., then wore and stood to the South-East and being pretty moderate we set the Topsails close Reef'd, but the South-West Sea runs so high that the Ship goes Bodily to leeward.

He recognised that I was determined, and was completely nonplussed. \"Henri, dear!\" cried a voice outside the door. \"Have you concluded your business? Do go and dress.\" Starting up wildly, he rushed to the door, and, turning the key, stood panting with his back against it. \"Yes, in five minutes--in five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I--I shall be at liberty,\" he answered, with difficulty. Then we both listened, and heard a woman's footsteps receding along the corridor. \"Have you decided?\" I asked. Again he tottered across the room to his chair. \"I--I have,\" he gasped hoarsely, with bent head. \"What is your decision?\" \"That she shall escape. She must leave the country immediately. If the secret that I conspired to set her free ever transpires, my career is doomed.

The shepherd at last let himself be persuaded, and gave the stranger his sheep. In order to test the truth of his statement about the dogs, he said at once, 'Salt, I am hungry,' and before the words were out of his mouth the dog had disappeared, and returned in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with a large basket full of the most delicious food. Then the youth congratulated himself on the bargain he had made, and continued his journey in the best of spirits. [Illustration] One day he met a carriage and pair, all draped in black; even the horses were covered with black trappings, and the coachman was clothed in crape from top to toe. Inside the carriage sat a beautiful girl in a black dress crying bitterly. The horses advanced slowly and mournfully, with their...", "...first a bag and then a box, each tolerably heavy. Sedley was amused. A mystification had set in; a quiet robbery, and he the receiver. He thought of dropping the booty down the area of the respectable house round the corner, but just then the man in the surtout emerged from the wing, so to speak, and marching slowly up the perspective of the lane, seemed about to disturb him, but once more changed his mind, and disappeared. \"What is to happen next?\" wondered Tom Sedley. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a door which opens from the back yard or garden of the house from which he had received his burthen, opened cautiously, and a woman in a cloak stepped out, carrying another bag, a heavy one it also seemed, and beckoning to him, said, so soon as he was sufficiently near-- \"Is the carriage come?\" \"Yes'm,\" answered Tom, touching his hat, and affecting as well as he could the ways of a porter or a cabman. \"When they comes,\" she resumed, \"you'll bring us to where it is,...", "...as a race were great gentlemen--and this one in particular--and because of that he would not be likely to make a scene in the train; but they would arrive at the hotel presently, and there was dinner to be got through, alone with him, and then--the afterwards. And as she thought of this her very lips grew white. The hideous, hideous hatefulness of men! Visions of moments of her first wedding journey with Ladislaus came back to her. He had not shown her any consideration for five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in his life. Everything in her nature was up in arms. She could not be just; with her belief in his baseness it seemed to her that here was this man--her husband--whom she had seen but four times in her life, and he was not content with the honest bargain which he perfectly understood; not content with her fortune and her willingness to adorn his house, but he must perforce allow his revolting senses to be aroused, he must desire to caress her, just because she was a...", "...from buxom Mrs. Kelly's store. Then, cautiously, noiselessly, the light coverlet was partly raised, the weary little curly heads were pillowed close beside the mother's, and then, leaving the night light turned low, stealthily they drew away and waited. \"She never sleeps more'n an hour or two at a time,\" whispered the steward. \"She'll be sure to wake before long,\" and so they lingered near the doorway, and Camp Almy, much of it, clustered in the moonlight without. Ten, fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed, and still there was no sound from the darkened room, and then, over at the guardhouse, the sentry on Number One started the call of eleven o'clock. Number Two, at the storehouse, took it up in his turn and trolled off his \"All's well,\" and then it was Number Three's turn, out just under the edge of the bench, and Three muffled his voice and strove to turn it into a lullaby as he began, and, as the first words of the soldier watch cry came floating in through the partly...", "...into the group. Loris was wounded in the side, but the ball striking a rib glanced off. A dozen men threw themselves upon the Governor, who defended himself with the strength of despair; but superior numbers quickly gained the mastery, and after a short struggle Pomeroff lay helpless upon the floor. Then one of the students took a vial of chloroform from his pocket. Seizing a napkin he saturated it with the liquid and applied it to the nostrils of the prostrated man. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the victim was insensible. \"Flee for your lives!\" ordered Martinski, \"we have not a moment to lose. It is fortunate that the shot has not already brought the police down upon us. We must carry the Governor at once to his palace. Drentell, you will pass the night with me.\" Under cover of a dark and cloudy night Pomeroff was carried to his home, and with the assistance of his secretary, Moleska, was carefully placed upon the couch in his private cabinet. FOOTNOTES:...", "...well,\" said Diana. With a sudden movement, she rose to her feet, whirled round on the hearthrug, tore the codicil to fragments, and flung them into the flames. \"There!\" she cried, towering over the astonished little lawyer in the large armchair. \"Now, no second codicil exists! I can still keep my restored faith in the love of Uncle Falcon; but I shall owe my home, my fortune, and all I possess, to my husband, David Rivers.\" CHAPTER XVI IN OLD ST. BOTOLPH'S At twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past ten, on the morning of the Feast of Epiphany, David Rivers stood in the empty church of St Botolph's, Bishopsgate, awaiting his bride. Perhaps no man ever came to his wedding looking less like a bridegroom than did David Rivers. Diana had scorned the suggestion, first mooted by Mrs. Marmaduke Vane, of clerical broadcloth of more fashionable cut, to be worn by David for this one occasion. \"Rubbish, my dear Chappie!\" had said Diana. \"You are just the sort of person...", "...it. For my part, I think you look a credit to it. Don't be bashful with young women, mind! As much as you please with the old ones. You know how to behave among men. There you have your Drawing-room Guide! I'm sure I shall be proud of you. Am I not?\" Mrs. Doria addressed his eyes coaxingly. A benevolent idea struck Richard, that he might employ the minutes to spare, in pleading the case of poor Ralph; and, as he was drawn along, he pulled out his watch to note the precise number of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he could dedicate to this charitable office. \"Pardon me,\" said Mrs. Doria. \"You want manners, my dear boy. I think it never happened to me before that a man consulted his watch in my presence.\" Richard mildly replied that he had an engagement at a particular hour, up to which he was her servant. \"Fiddlededee!\" the vivacious lady sang. \"Now I've got you, I mean to keep you. Oh! I've heard all about you. This ridiculous indifference that your father makes so much of! Why,...", "...with a steady directness. Mrs. Janney's demand for information was promptly answered; indeed her narrative was so devoid of unnecessary detail, so confined to essentials, that it suggested something gone over and put in readiness for the telling. She had taken Bebita to the dressmaker and the oculist, the child accompanying her into both places. At the third stop, Justin's, she had persuaded Bebita to stay in the taxi. She had left it at the curb and had not been more than ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the store. When she came out it was gone. She had spent some time looking for it, searched up and down the street, and, though she was frightened, she could not believe anything had happened. Her idea had been that Bebita, tired of waiting or wanting to play a joke on her, had prevailed on the driver to return to the Fifth Avenue house. She had hailed a cab and gone back there and it was not till she saw Mrs. Price that she realized the real extent of the calamity. Mrs....", "...the bent, mourning figures of my mother and sister standing before the marble tablet. I was just building up some more sentimental nonsense about myself--for I'm afraid that just at that period I was very romantic, and fond of thinking too much of Gil Vincent--when I was brought back to the present by Brace. \"Look at them,\" he cried. \"They are going through that movement remarkably well. Be careful, and don't show yourself.\" I shrank back a little among the trees, and for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we watched the troop go through some of the regular evolutions, passing us on their way down the plain, at a distance of about two hundred yards, and I trembled lest our horses should select that moment for whinnying or trying to break away. But they were quiet, and the cavalcade went slowly on at a walk towards where our men ought to be in ambush. Then I turned to look at Brace, whose left hand was fidgeting with the hilt of his sword, lifting it nervously, and dropping it...", "...chance. I lived on my wife's earnings. I went to the bad as deliberately as any one in the world did, but I do not remember that I ever told a willful lie.\" There passed through Lord Arleigh's mind a wish that the Duchess of Hazlewood might have heard this avowal. \"I do not remember,\" the man said again, \"that I have ever told a willful lie in my life. I will not begin now. You asked me if I was really guilty. Yes, I was--guilty just as my judges pronounced me to be!\" For a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Lord Arleigh was silent; the disappointment was almost greater than he could bear. He had anticipated so much from this interview; and now by these deliberately spoken words his hopes were ended--he would never be able to take his beautiful young wife to his heart and home. The bitterness of the disappointment seemed almost greater than he could bear. He tried to recover himself, while Henry Dornham went on: \"The rich never have anything to do with the poor without harm comes...", "...was lifted, and Antoinette was doing great things to a very large cabbage-leaf. Towser had established himself in the sunshine atop the porch roof and gazed down benignly at the pair below. Laurie and Polly talked, of course, about the game. He and George were again to act as escorts to the two girls, a fact that had eaten a large hole in Laurie's remaining allowance. About ten o'clock he took himself away, reminding Polly to be ready at half-past one, since it took a good ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to walk to the field, and because, wisely, he realized that to Polly \"half-past one\" would mean a quarter or two. Climbing the fence into Bob's yard, he discovered that young man with a new crowbar about to begin an attack on the remaining posts of the arbor. So he removed his sweater, moistened his hands in the time-honored and only efficacious manner, and joined the assault. After the posts were added to the pile beside the fence, the two boys went indoors and refreshed the...", "...was to be made fast, until the necessary ceremonies were gone through. But their doubts on the subject were soon to be changed into certainty.

She told me to bring it to you.

Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after she returned to the drawing-room, but no Lilias was there. Mary's heart failed her. \"Was I wrong to leave her?\" she said to herself. \"I thought it would be so horrid for me to seem to be watching how she took it.\" She flew up-stairs to her sister's bedroom. The door was shut, but not locked. Mary knocked. \"Come in,\" said Lilias's voice, and hardly knowing what she was going to see, Mary entered. There stood Lilias in the centre of the room, her beautiful fair...", "...as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on. \"Hasn't tha' got good sense?\" she said once, when Mary had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her. \"Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee an' she's only four year' old. Sometimes tha' looks fair soft in th' head.\" Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her think several entirely new things. She stood at the window for about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> this morning after Martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs. She was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library. She did not care very much about the library itself, because she had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them. Were there a hundred really?...", "...mine. Joe and I then changed places, and I kept hard at the oars until we came to the reach which ran close up to the \"Why Not.\" Here Joe resumed the oars and I the ropes. \"This is the only danger-spot,\" I said. \"Yonder are the lights of the ale-house. On an ordinary night there would be no one about, even if it mattered if there were, but to-night, when it does matter, there are thousands of soldiers on the march, and there is some risk of our being observed.\" In another five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or so we heard faint snatches of song and bursts of applause, and shouting and laughing. The \"Why Not\" was now about a hundred yards ahead on our left. On the right the bank was lined with willows which, not having been pollarded for many years, stretched their long, thin branches well over the river. I ran the boat as far under them as I could. Joe pulled with short, soft strokes, and we crept slowly along. For a minute the lighted windows were obscured by the outhouses, and...", "...decorous front seat of the car--first the footman looked back along the road, then the chauffeur, after which a thrill of excitement seemed to fairly race up and down their liveried backs. The car itself took a notion to quiver with the promise of joy unrestrained. In less than a minute they were going more than a mile a minute over a short stretch of the Avenue de Longchamp. At the Porte de Hippodrome they slowed down and ran into the Bois, taking the first road to the left. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they were scudding past Longchamp at a \"fair clip\" to quote R. Schmidt. Instead of diverging into the Allee de Longchamp, the car took a sharp turn into the Avenue de l'Hippodrome and, at the intersection, doubled back over the Allee de la Heine Marguerite, going almost to the Boulogne gate, where again it was sent Parisward over the Avenue de St. Cloud. Miss Guile was in command of the flight. She called out the instructions to the driver and her knowledge of the intricate...", "...skiff. On and still on came the noisy steamer until the strokes of its blades in the water could be distinctly heard. Several times the boys united in shouts, but at last it was plainly manifest that their signal of distress had been discovered and that the lake boat had turned to rescue the victims of the sinking skiff. Not long afterward a yawl was lowered from the boat and two men took their places at the oars. With strong and steady sweeps they drew near the boys and not many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterward quickly dragged both on board the yawl. The reaction had come to both John and Fred and neither was able to sit erect. Their teeth were chattering as if both were suffering from an ague. Indeed, neither boy was fully aware of the events which were occurring until at last they were somehow brought on board the lake boat. There were willing hands to assist them there and speedily they were taken below, where their wet clothing was removed and after a thorough rub-down...", "...many?' said the old woman, raising her head; `_three_! Then count the sharks which are coming up.' \"`Count the sharks, mother! why count them?

He is just the most provokingly uncertain man now living.\" And yet it was not a formidable looking man she found in the library a few minutes before the dinner hour. He was poring over some pictures of Panama in one of the weeklies, sufficiently deep in them to permit Katie to sit there for the moment pondering methods of attack. But instead of outlining her campaign she found herself concluding, what she had concluded...", "...madness! For him to go out with his gouty feet in such cold weather was sheer folly!

Cuchillo, after reaching the mountains, had halted. He had not forgotten the appearance of the place, and his heart trembled with fear and joy. After a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he looked around him more calmly. It was then dark, and when he arrived at the rock, the damp vapours from the lake enveloped with a thick veil both the valley and the tomb. The sound of the waterfall put an end to his uncertainties; he remembered that it fell into a gulf close by the golden placer. He had dismounted his horse, and sat down to wait for daylight; but scarcely had he done so when he bounded up as though bitten by a serpent. A fatal chance had led him to sit...", "...baggage and squatted there with his arms wrapped round his knees.

This was expected, for it was not in the initial attack, but during the consolidation that the 3rd Division wanted to draw the enemy's fire. At a few minutes before six our time had come, smoke bombs were thrown, and, though the wind was against us, Col. Jones, feeling that we must make the biggest possible display, ordered the straw to be lit. This promptly drew fire, and in five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> there was not one single gun on our side of the Salient still firing at Hooge, they had all turned on us. At first sight of the smoke several machine guns had opened fire opposite \"50\" and \"49,\" but these died away almost at once as the Boche, thoroughly frightened at the prospect of gas, evacuated his trenches.

Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards, as the dejected Mr. Pucker was crawling out of the quad, Filcher came and led him back to the rooms of Mr. Slowcoach, the real examining tutor. \"But I have been examined,\" Mr. Pucker kept on saying dejectedly. \"I have been examined, and they rejected me.\" \"I think it was an 'oax, sir,\" said Filcher. \"A what!\" stammered Mr. Pucker. \"A 'oax--a sell,\" said the scout. \"Those two gents has been 'aving a little game with you, sir.

Talking about frolics, he wasn't tempted with liquor, or bad company either; he chose his own company: he had his parrot, his goats, his man Friday--all steady sort of fellows, with no nonsense about them.

He was anxious to see the first glimpse of the people who were staying at the Manor, but as yet there was no sign of any one of them, though the time wanted only five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to eleven. The familiar click of the latch of the gate which divided the church precincts from the rectory garden, made him turn his head in that direction, to watch his master approaching the scene of his morning's ministrations.

Paula did not venture to disturb the worshipper, who was kneeling just in the narrow passage; so some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> elapsed before the leech, observing her uneasiness, came out of the larger room, touched the nun on the shoulder, and said in a low voice of genuine kindness: \"One moment, good Sister. Your pious intercession will be heard--but this damsel is in haste.\" The nun rose at once and made way, sending a wrathful glance after Paula as she hurried down the stairs. At the door of the court-yard she looked out and about for the Arab, but in vain.

Presently it was strident and near at hand; and then, standing like a frozen thing, not daring to stir (indeed, half petrified with fear) she saw the marauding taxicab wheel slowly past, the chauffeur scrutinising one side of the way, the man in the grey duster standing up in the body and holding the door half open, while he raked with...", "...as he would go back to his house to examine whether he might perchance have left it there.

The clerk, satisfied with this plausible statement, fitting in so well with antecedent circumstances, delivered the money accordingly, but was startled a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later by the reappearance of the first claimant, with the declaration that, as he had not been able to find the order at home, it must of course have been lost, and a request that nothing might be done until a new order was obtained.

The elements that mingled in it scarce admit of discrimination. It was still more than previously a deep sense of being justified. My interlocutor was for those ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> immeasurably superior--superior, I mean, to himself--and he couldn't possibly have become so save through the relation I had so patiently tracked.

She had recovered her senses, but scarcely appreciated as yet where she was; nor did she seem to care what became of her.

The fact that this strange girl had been no relation of the wife of the schooner's captain, and that Mrs. Kirby seemed, indeed, to know very little about her, mystified the stout girl and her friends exceedingly. They whispered a good deal among themselves about the castaway; but she sat between...", "...sober, was always well instructed in the news of the town.

She stared in amazement as it sprang lightly...", "...thought: \"If tombs were only as roomy as this house I shouldn't mind being done with daylight and the world, and covered up. Now, I'd give all I own in this world to have a comfortable mind like Williams, my friend the publican, over the way.

Ha-ha-ha!\" CHAPTER XXII. A QUARTER PAST TWELVE. Oscar Leigh sat in the dark on the last step but one of the stairs of his house, awaiting the arrival of John Timmons. It was close to the appointed hour. He had spent the interval in his workshop with the clock. He had one of his knees drawn up close to his body, his elbow rested on his knee, his long bearded chin in the palm of...", "...I of joining some of them, that I had the reports of my detachment made out ready to present to the officer commanding in the town. Candasaly is only five miles from Candy, and the road good. When half way from hence to this capital, we passed a heavy Dutch gun which the enemy were bringing up to the battery on the river. Our advanced guard had scarcely got within range of a temple which is situated on a hill above the town of Candy, when they sustained a volley of musketry; a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards I could plainly perceive the enemy flying through the streets in great confusion. It was now evident that none of the other divisions had arrived. After detaching Lieutenant Rogers with a party of Sepoys to occupy the heights commanding the town, our troops once more took possession of the capital, which they found, as usual, entirely deserted by its inhabitants. The palace being in the most favourable situation for resisting any immediate attack, I took possession...", "...under par yet,\" he said, arranging Beany's bandages. \"I would suggest another nap or two.\" \"All right,\" said the officers and they moved toward the door. \"We aren't sleepy,\" said Porky. \"How could we be sleepy at this time of day?\" He yawned widely. Everybody laughed. \"Just try it and see what you can do in the way of snoring,\" said the doctor. \"One more good snooze, and you will be ready to bring in another submarine and some more prisoners.\" He left the room, and in two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the boys were both asleep. They were exhausted, with the trying mental exhaustion that people feel who have undergone great anxiety and danger. The two Captains and the Colonel went into Captain Greene's cabin and for a long time talked the matter over. They could hear the crew and the soldiers making merry. It had been a great experience; an experience which fortunately had had a good ending. Already a lot of the boys were writing highly-colored, lengthy accounts...", "...and ran up to the drawing-room. They were there sitting side by side on the sofa. I could see they were very much upset. The young fellow turned red, and he got up, stammering, and speaking a lot of rot. \"'What! you back already? How did you get on at Ascot? Had a good day?' \"'Rippin'; but I'm going to have a better one now,' I said, keeping my eye all the while on my wife. I could see by her face that there was no doubt about it. Then I took him by the throat. 'I just give you two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to confess the truth; I know it, but I want to hear it from you. Now, out with it, or I'll strangle you.' I gave him a squeeze just to show him that I meant it. He turned up his eyes, and my wife cried, 'Murder!' I threw him back from me and got between her and the door, locked it, and put the key in my pocket. 'Now,' I said, 'I'll drag the truth out of you both.' He did look white, he shrivelled up by the chimney-piece, and she--well, she looked as if she could have killed me,...", "...to Smernoff,\" said Mr. Pauling. \"No use in keeping him locked up if he's in earnest.\" Reaching the observation room Rawlins led the boys to the eye-piece of the periscope and as Tom squinted into it he gave a delighted cry. \"Gosh, Frank, we _are_ under water! Say, I can see the island back there pretty near two miles away. Isn't it great! Think of being in a real submarine under the sea!\" Frank was as delighted and interested as Tom when his turn came to have a look. Then, a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, the louder rumble of the Diesel motors throbbed through the undersea craft and Rawlins announced that they were on the surface. \"No use running submerged except when in sight of land or a vessel,\" he said, \"she doesn't make half her speed underwater and it's a strain on her and we might bump into a reef. I'm not any too familiar with the channels that will accommodate her submerged.\" Hurrying up the steel ladder the boys and Rawlins reached the deck and gazed about,...", "...dark whirling blackness of the glooming cloud lowered thicker and thicker around them. \"Let me go, Mona!\" he gasped forth wearily, in his semi-faint. \"I may drag you down. Good-bye. Now--let go!\" She almost laughed. The strong grasp tightened upon his hand firmer than ever. \"If you go, I go too. Now I am going to shout. Perhaps Charlie will hear.\" And lifting up her voice she sent forth a long, clear, ringing call; then another and another. No answer. Then, as the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> went by, the bolt of a wild despair shot through Mona's brave heart. Strong as she was, she could not hold him for ever, nor was he able, in the agony of his broken wrist, to raise himself any farther. Her brain reeled. Wild-eyed with despair she strove to pierce the opaque grey curtain which was crusting her face and hair with rime. It was winter, and this table-topped mountain was of considerable elevation. What if this thick chill cloud was the precursor of a heavy...", "...of my own department.\" \"It means reducing me to a mere cypher.\" \"Such bargains are questions for experts, and should be left to experts.\" \"If I were to leave them to experts like you I should be bankrupt in a fortnight.\" \"I'm sorry, but you must choose between your methods and mine. There's ten minutes to do it in.\" \"It won't take ten minutes to see what will ruin me quickest. As I told you before, I'm not going back on my bargain.\" \"Nor I on mine.\" Isaac spent three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in reflection. He reflected first, that Keith had been in the past \"a young profligate\"; secondly, that he was at the present moment in love; thirdly, that in the future he would infallibly be hungry. He would think very differently when he had forgotten the lady; or if he didn't think differently he would behave differently when his belly pinched him. Isaac was a firm believer in the persuasive power of the primitive appetites. \"Only seven minutes,\" murmured Keith. \"I'm...", "...looked on with grim satisfaction. \"Tha's getten what tha deserved, owd lad,\" he said in an undertone. \"An' tha'st getten no more.

It would be wise to know the extent of his injury. Accordingly, he made his appearance in the parlor, somewhat startling his friend, who was at supper. \"My dear Fergus!\" exclaimed Paul. \"How excited you look!\" Derrick flung himself into a chair, feeling rather dubious about his strength, all at once. \"Do I?\" he said, with a faint smile. \"Don't be alarmed, Grace, I have no doubt I look as I feel. I have been having a brush with...", "...or examine the servants first?\" inquired the duke. \"Examine the servants first, your grace; as I may thereby gain some clew to follow in my search.\" \"Very well,\" said the duke, again touching the bell. The prompt footman re-appeared. \"Whom do you wish called first?\" inquired the duke. \"The lady's maid,\" answered the detective. \"Go and tell the duchess's maid that she is wanted here immediately,\" said the duke. The footman bowed and went away on his errand. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed, and the lady's maid entered. \"This is--I really forget your name, my good girl,\" said the duke, apologetically. \"Margaret, sir; Margaret Watson,\" said the lady's maid, with a courtesy. \"Ay. This is Margaret Watson, the confidential maid of her grace, Mr. Setter. Margaret, my good girl, Mr. Setter wishes to put some questions to you, relating to the disappearance of your mistress. I hope you will answer his inquiries as frankly and fearlessly as you have answered...", "...to be of the same taciturn disposition as Tom, for he made no answer to the different questions that were addressed to him, nor did he even condescend to look at the speakers. The shower having ceased, the moon shining brightly through the window, the stranger walked out again, without the sign of leave-taking. \"That be a queer chap,\" said the ostler, \"I'll run and see where he's going,\" and he followed the stranger, who had awakened a curiosity in every one except Tom. Scarcely five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had elapsed, when the ostler rushed into the room, pale as death. \"Udds buddikins!\" said he, and it was not before a glass of spirits had been poured down his throat, that he could state the cause of his alarm. \"Old chap just gone out got no proper face like--only a death's head--he just looked around on me in the moonlight.\" \"Do you mean to say,\" exclaimed Tom, \"that he is nothing but a skeleton?\" \"Aye, sure I do,\" said the ostler. \"And which way did he go?\" \"Why,...", "...Moreover, although more than once, as he fought his way through a jungle or jumped a windfall, something nipped his heart, pinching him up inside, and making his eyes leak, he felt that the thing had ended well for him--and for Chris. Herb, in his simple faith, scarcely doubted that the old chum, whom he had forgiven, had reached a Home-Camp where his broken will and stunted life might be repaired, and grow as they had poor chance to grow here. \"Say, boys!\" he burst forth, a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after his protest against \"moping,\" and when the band were within sight of the spring whence they had started, an age back, as it seemed, on the trail of the moose. \"Say, boys! I've been all these years raging at Chris. Seems to me now as if he was a poor sort of overgrowed baby, and not so bad a thief as the chump who gave him that whiskey, and stole his senses. It's a thundering big pity that man hadn't the burying of him to-day. \"He was always the under dog,--was Chris,\"...", "...over the tulips awhile, where in serried borders they displayed their somber sheen of amaranth and amethyst; then Guy strolled off to hear what was the news of Margaret and Richard. Pauline came flying to meet him down one of the long, straight garden paths. \"Darling, they are to be married early in August,\" she cried. He caught her to him and kissed her, lest in the first poignant realization of other people's joy she might seem to be escaping from him utterly. Guy had a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with Margaret before he went home that evening, and they walked beside the tulip borders, she tall and dark and self-contained in the fading light, being strangely suited by association with such flowers. \"Dear Margaret,\" he said, \"I want to tell you how tremendously I like Richard. Now that sounds patronizing. But I'm speaking quite humbly. These sort of Englishmen have been celebrated enough, perhaps, and lately there's been a tendency to laugh at them, but, my God! what...", "...brave; the Antelope Comanches will be happy to receive them and burn powder in their honour. A Chief will go alone to the village to announce their arrival to the Sachems.\" \"Go then, Chief, we will await you here.\" \"Wah! My brother has spoken well.\" The Indian vigorously lashed his horse, which bounded ahead and speedily disappeared behind the peak to which the hunter had pointed. The horsemen drew up in line and waited motionless with their hands on their weapons. In a very few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a noise was heard resembling the rolling of thunder, and suddenly a crowd of mounted Indians appeared, coming up at full speed, brandishing their weapons, discharging their guns, howling and whistling in the long _iskochettas_ made of human thigh bones, which they wore hanging from their necks. On their side, the hunters, at a sign from the man who appeared to be their leader, made their horses curvet, and discharged their weapons with repeated shouts and demonstrations of...", "...to stand near the mouth, not yet quite cleared.

She had left it lying and probably would never remember it at all. Her comrade's decision was therefore quickly made not to speak of having followed her; and within five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of her return, wonderfully enough, the preoccupation denoted by her forgetfulness further declared itself. \"Should you think me quite abominable if I were to say that after all----?\" Mrs. Stringham had already thought, with the first sound of the question, everything she was capable of thinking, and had immediately made such a sign that Milly's words gave place to visible relief at her assent. \"You don't care for our stop here--you'd rather go straight on? We'll start then...", "...passed. \"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\" said Mr. Weston, looking about. \"We thought you were to bring them.\" The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--\"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,\" said Frank to his father: \"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:\" and away he went. Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing. \"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.

Fast as we went, we never saw him again that memorable morning. Jonah must have gone like the wind. As for us, we wasted no time.

From Argeles to Lourdes is over eight miles. It was when we had covered exactly four of these in six <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> that the engine stuttered, sighed, and then just fainted away. We had run out of petrol. This was annoying, but not a serious matter, for there was a can on the step. The two gallons it was containing would easily bring us to Pau. What was much more annoying and of considerable moment was that the can, when examined, proved to be dry as a bone.

Then, taking a drinking cup, he took in each hand one half of a dead toad, and squeezed from it all the juices and fluids it contained into the cup, and the same he did with the remainder. After mixing the contents together, he swallowed the whole, and then placing the cup on the bench he advanced to the edge of the stage, where for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he remained stationary. Then he became pale as death and his limbs trembled, and his body began to swell in a frightful and terrible manner; and all the spectators began to believe that he would never recover from the poison he had swallowed, and that his death was certain. Suddenly, taking from a jar by his side some of his celebrated 'Orvietano,' he placed a portion of it in his mouth and swallowed it. Instantly, the effect of this wonderful medicine was to make him vomit the...", "...atone for my vanity by saying I dared do next to nothing to forward my suit. My foothold was altogether too precarious; an attempt to climb higher would only have involved me in a headlong fall. And yet, before I had been a week at Adelphi Terrace, I made the attempt.

She would be dining alone; if I had nothing better to do, would I look in for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and see if I could cheer her up? I had promised to dine with Nigel, but it was a small party and I managed to slip away before ten. Joyce was half asleep when I was shown into the drawing-room; she did not hear me announced, and I was standing within two feet of her before she noticed my presence. \"I've run you to earth at last,\" I said. Then I observed a thing that made me absurdly pleased. Joyce was looking very white and tired, with dark rings round the eyes, and under...", "...sighed Gwen, feeling the unfortunate parcel carefully. \"It seems to be a box.\" \"Yes, but what's inside the box is smashed. You can hear the bits rattle when you shake it,\" returned Emma smartly. \"It's her new afternoon tea set, I'll be bound. She told me she was going to order one from Parker's.\" \"There's Parker's name on the label,\" agreed Gwen despondently. \"Yes, and if you think--\" \"Look here, I've got an idea,\" interrupted Netta. \"You said the box only arrived about five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago, so Miss Roscoe can't possibly know that it's come yet.

The driver sprung from his seat and the carriage door was opened. Out of it...", "...woe. \"Say, Limber, are we all fired?\" Limber seated himself, took out his sack of tobacco and papers, rolled a cigarette and lighted it, without one word. His face was serious. Six mournful eyes watched him. They read their fate in his silence. There was no appeal. In a corner of the bunk-room three rolls of blankets were stacked. Limber looked at them, but said nothing. Three hands went to hip pockets. In dead silence three cigarettes were made and lighted. It was a cowboy wake. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> went by.

But Altman would see that they were delivered--every one of them. A contract with West Cluster meant a good deal more than the face value of the one shipment of inter-calc banks.

But the distress of her position became every moment more and more acute, and, seeing that it was hopeless to anticipate the assistance of any chance passer, she made one more effort to free herself, and by exerting all her remaining strength, succeeded in tearing herself from the offensive bough--at the cost of a great rent in her beautiful dress and a fall, which left her for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> lying insensible on the ground at the foot of the tree.

Malcolm did make haste, and so did Florimel. What precisely was in her thoughts who shall say, when she could not have told herself? But doubtless the chance of seeing Lenorme urged her more than the desire to see her father's portrait. Within twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they were riding down Grosvenor Place, and happily heard no following hoofbeats. When they came near the river, Malcolm rode up to her and said, \"Would your ladyship allow me to put up the horses in Mr Lenorme's stable?

He had made good use of the few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the boys had occupied in dressing, for a small boat already lay alongside the steamer. Harry surmised that the men, who were all exceedingly fond of their commander, had assisted Washington in order that he might set out to give what aid he could to Captain Dynamite.

Faber would have pushed past him, annoyed, but Polwarth held out a little phial to him. \"Perhaps that is what you want, sir,\" he said. The doctor caught it hastily, almost angrily, from his hand, looked at it, uncorked it, and put it to his nose. \"Thank you,\" he said, \"this is just what I wanted,\" and returned instantly to the chamber. The little man resumed his patient seat on the side, breathing heavily. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of utter silence followed. Then Dorothy passed him with a note in her hand, and hurried down the stair. The next instant Polwarth heard the sound of Niger's hoofs tearing up the slope behind the house. \"I have got some more medicines here, Miss Drake,\" he said, when she reappeared on the stair. As he spoke he brought out phial after phial, as if his pockets widened out below into the mysterious recesses of the earth to which as a gnome he belonged. Dorothy, however, told...", "...contradicting yourself all along and I intend to find out why.\" \"There isn't much more to find out.... Wait.\" The doctor strode quickly over to the radio, and glanced at his wristwatch.

It was a little red key--a key to Earth, to life and to the chance to ram every cold, precise, contemptuous word down his father's over-analytical mouth. He didn't really hate the old man but he knew that he feared him. He feared also that his father might be right about him after...", "...the girl was sitting. She looked up at him as he bent over her chair; both were very serious. \"You and I are the only two people bidding,\" he said. \"There are two copies of the book. Don't bid against me and you can buy in the other one for next to nothing--judging from the course this one is taking.\" \"Very well,\" she said quietly. A moment later the first copy of Valdez was knocked down to James White. An indifferent audience paid little attention to the transaction. Two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the second copy fell to Miss Jean Sandys for five dollars--there being no other bidder. White had already left the galleries. Lingering at the entrance he saw Miss Sandys pass him, and he lifted his hat. The slightest inclination of her pretty head acknowledged it. The next moment they were lost to each other's view in the crowded street. Clutching his battered book to his chest, not even daring to drop it into his overcoat for fear of pickpockets, the young fellow...", "...I have as much money in the office,\" stammered the pallid banker. \"That won't work,\" exclaimed the visitor angrily. \"If you can't find it I will send you where you won't need money,\" and he moved his arm as if to throw the valise on the floor. \"I--I'll give you a check,\" faltered Luther Rockwell, the banker. \"And stop payment on it,\" said the crank with a cunning look. \"No, that won't do.\" \"Give me half an hour to get the money,\" pleaded Rockwell desperately. \"Perhaps twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> will do.\" \"You would send for a policeman,\" said the intruder. \"That won't do, I must have the money now. Or, if you haven't got it, bonds will answer.\" Luther Rockwell looked helplessly toward the two clerks, but they were even more terrified than he. There was one to whom he did not look for help, and that was the telegraph boy, who stood but three feet from the crank, watching him sharply. For a plan of relief had come into the mind of Mark Mason, who, though he...", "...a close board fence, nine feet high. 'In the suffocating heat of summer,' says Wm. Dunlap, 'I saw every narrow aperture of these stone walls filled with human heads, face above face, seeking a portion of the external air.' \"While the gaol fever was raging in the summer of 1777, the prisoners were let out in companies of twenty, for half an hour at a time, to breathe fresh air, and inside they were so crowded, that they divided their numbers into squads of six each.

And under the dim light of the station lamp we saw the weeping mother hold her soldier boy close to her aching heart as they kissed the last long, good-bye kiss. Those affecting scenes so often re-enacted before us contributed in no small degree to intensify the solemnity of that hour. At one station standing on the depot platform was an ominous looking box, and in the few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we were delayed there we learned from an old gentleman that it contained the remains of his boy which he was taking back to mother and the old northern home for burial. His soldier boy had been killed in a skirmish with the rebels down in Missouri. On the evening of the third day from home the train which bore our detachment pulled slowly into Cairo.

From another portion of the sponge was made a twist or braided loaf. And to the remaining portion of dough was added 1/2 cup of currants or raisins, and this was called a \"Currant\" or \"Raisin Loaf,\" which she served for dinner the following day. The rolls were placed in the oven of the range a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before breakfast and served hot, broken apart and eaten with maple syrup or honey and the delicious \"Farmers' Pound Cake\" was served for supper. Aunt Sarah baked these on ironing day.

Cautiously I lifted my eyes to the level of the cane, and peered over. The Spanish boat, a large one propelled by the vigorous sweep of twelve oars, was already a hundred yards above, swiftly stemming the current. From their gestures I judged the debate yet raged between the gray-robe crouched in the stern, and the big, burly fellow, resplendent in gold lace, standing up and urging his oarsmen to greater exertion. Within ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they rounded the upper point, and when they again appeared within vision, the boat was a mere dot floating in the midst of the golden sunshine, where the setting sun gave a good-night kiss to the vast, sombre river.

He saw clearly that he had nothing to gain by refusing, and everything to lose. Moreover the spirit of revenge was strong within him.

On the evening of the 28th we entered a large and promising opening,* distant twenty-one miles from Morning Inlet; its importance was made manifest by its forming a channel of two feet at low-water through the flat at the entrance, which it threw out considerably. (*Footnote. The mouth is in latitude 17 degrees 36 minutes 40 seconds South, and longitude 8 degrees 27 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> 0 seconds East of Port Essington.) The boats proceeded up the opening at daylight on the 29th; our hopes were considerably raised by finding a depth of three and, in some places, five fathoms, and a width of about a hundred and twenty yards. The banks were, as usual, lined with mangroves; behind which, on the eastern side, retreated vast plains, with trees of some size scattered over them. They extend to the coast eastward of the entrance, which is sandy for some distance,...", "...princelings who were present? How forsaken and ill-treated she seemed to herself!

From time to time he took a drink of whiskey and licked his lips. An hour passed, two hours, and always the legless man kept his agate eyes upon the closet door. When two hours and fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had gone, he drew an automatic pistol from his pocket, and held it ready for instant use. A few minutes later, finding his original plan of humor a little tedious in the working out, he spoke in a clear, incisive voice: \"Better come out of that now or I shall begin to shoot.\" The door opened, and Rose staggered into the room.

She sank to...", "...\"if this is\"--Billy's articulation was improving, but otherwise he was just as tipsy as ever--\"if this is--Chris-to-pher Street--or--or Wednesday?\" \"Hey?\" inquired the policeman, and stared.

While the 'Thorn' was getting into position, the enemy fired a full broadside at her which did but little damage.

I watched her, and I wanted to detect in every look and movement that she did not love her husband, and I fancied that I did see it. Dmitri Petrovitch was soon struggling with sleep.

Attached to it were two sheets of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> which had passed between various individuals regarding the case in question; the last minute was addressed to M.B. 3, and said \"Passed to you for information and necessary action.\" It was a melancholy tale from an aggrieved citizen concerning his infant, who was liable to a heavy tax, and who had been drowned by his aunt while being washed, before he was two hours old, and the authorities still demanded the payment of the tax.

With a hasty kiss dropped on the top of her uncle's head, she dashed for the door and clattered down the stairs two at a time. Reaching the street, she ran all the way to the corner and there swung upon the rear end of a street car just as it was starting. Breathlessly, she dropped into the nearest seat and looked at her wrist watch. \"Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to four,\" she told herself. \"If this old car isn't too poky, I'll make it on time yet.\" Doris seldom was late for her vocal lessons, for her interest in music was genuine, and she realized that it was a privilege to be a student of the famed Herr Von Heflinger who accepted only the most promising pupils. On more than one occasion, Doris had become a trifle discouraged, for Von Heflinger was strict and offered criticism more freely than praise.

Then came the order for the _Baltimore_ to stand in and destroy the enemy's fortifications, and ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the battle was on once more. Now the fire was slow and deliberate, the gunners taking careful aim, bent on expending the least amount of ammunition with the greatest possible execution.

She called the attention of her friends to the approaching object, which, in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> was sufficiently near to exhibit the outline of a man of tall stature. He was advancing rapidly, with the light springy step peculiar to the Highlanders, and was traversing with apparent ease, ground, which, from its ruggedness and steepness, would have rendered the progress of one accustomed to such travelling, slow, laborious, and painful. The person now approaching seemed not to feel any such difficulties. He bounded lightly and rapidly over the ground, and in a few minutes...", "...These words were uttered in a tone somewhat more haughty than his previous ones; and contenting myself with a civil acknowledgment of his attention, I bowed and returned to my horse, which the little peasant child had been holding. \"This way, Monsieur,\" said the groom, who, dressed in a plain dark brown livery, was mounted on a horse of great size and symmetry.

Luigi lost count of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in his irritation at the mystery, which he took as a personal offence. Some suspicion or wariness existed in the lighted room, for the maestro threw up a window, and inspected the street to right and left. Apparently satisfied he withdrew his head, and the window was closed. In a little while Vittoria's voice rose audible out of the stillness, though she restrained its volume. Its effect upon Luigi was to make him protest to her, whimpering with pathos as if she heard and...", "...and I'll not stop till I get him,\" he cried, all the brotherly love of a lifetime in his ringing voice. \"And me!\" \"And me!\" \"And me!\" came from a dozen throats. Plainsmen were always the truest of comrades in the hour of danger. Nobody questioned Jondo's wisdom now. All thought was for the missing man. Rex Krane had leaped up on the wagon next to Jondo's and stood gazing toward the northwest. At this outburst of eagerness he turned to the crowd in the corral. \"You wait five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and Gail will be here. He's gettin' into sight out yonder now,\" he declared. Another shout, a rush for the open, and a straining of eyes to make sure of the lone rider coming swiftly down the trail I had followed out at midnight. And amid a wild swinging of hats and whoops of joy I rode into camp, hugged by Beverly and questioned by everybody, eager for my story from the time I left the camp until I rode into it again. \"They took me to Pawnee Rock before they let me know...", "...hated them. They rode free on his car, and sometimes kept an eye on him in the rush hours. They had a way, too, of letting him settle his own disputes with inebriated gentlemen who refused to pay their fares. \"Looks as though they'd come pretty close to grabbing you,\" he opened, by way of conversation. \"But ten of 'em aren't a match for one smart girl. They can't run. All got flat feet.\" Anna nodded. She was faint and dizzy, and the car seemed to creep along. It was twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after eleven when she got out. The conductor leaned down after her, hanging to the handrail. \"Good luck to you!\" he said. \"And you'd better get a better face on you than that. It's enough to send you up, on suspicion!\" She hardly heard him. She began to run, and again she said over and over her little inarticulate prayer. She knew the Spencer house. More than once she had walked past it, on Sunday afternoons, for the sheer pleasure of seeing Graham's home. Well, all that...", "...And then came the men, side by side, deadly dumb, with set faces, the pale sun glinting coldly cruel upon the snaky, lean barrels of their slung rifles, moving with steady, fleet, giant strides on their immense spidery ski that were eleven feet long, which whispered ghostily among the silent aisles of Nature's cathedral of a thousand columns. The Brothers were on the death-trail of Gulo at last; the terrible, dreaded Brothers, who could overtake a full-grown wolf in under thirty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> on ski, and whose single bullet spelt certain death. Now for it; now for the fight. Now for the great test of the \"star\" wild outlaw against the \"star\" human hunters--at last. The reindeer were to be avenged. Then Time took the bit of silence between his teeth and seconds became hours, and minutes generations. No sound made the wolverines as they rolled along in Indian file, except for the soft whisper of the snow underfoot. No noise encompassed the Brothers as they...", "...but how it is accomplished is difficult to say. The sound as a whole resembles the braying of an ass, except the notes are shorter, the climax higher, and the sound is louder. A gorilla does not yell in this manner every night, but when he does so it is usually between two and five o'clock in the morning; I have never heard the sound during the day nor in the early part of the night. When he thus screams, he repeats the series from ten to twenty times, at intervals of one or two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> each. I know of nothing in the way of vocal sounds that can inspire such terror as the voice of the gorilla. It can be heard over a distance of three or four miles. I could assign no definite meaning to it unless it was intended to alarm some intruder that came too near. One morning between three and four o'clock I heard two of them screaming at the same time. I do not mean to say at the same instant, but at intervals during the same period of time. One of them was within...", "...extent. Affixing a line thereto, he selected a fly of a particular pattern from a small box which he carried with him, and, making a skillful cast, threw his line into the very centre of that living stream which ebbed and flowed through Montgomery Street. Either the people were very virtuous that evening, or the bait was not a taking one. In vain the Devil whipped the stream at an eddy in front of the Occidental, or trolled his line into the shadows of the Cosmopolitan; five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed without even a nibble. \"Dear me!\" quoth the Devil, \"that's very singular; one of my most popular flies, too! Why, they'd have risen by shoals in Broadway or Beacon Street for that. Well, here goes another.\" And fitting a new fly from his well-filled box, he gracefully recast his line. For a few moments there was every prospect of sport. The line was continually bobbing and the nibbles were distinct and gratifying. Once or twice the bait was apparently gorged and...", "...themselves; they would be sure to be trampled under foot. Every one knew that on such occasions many a corpse littered the roads when finally the crowd disappeared. Those of sober sense realized all this, but they were but small units in this multitude heated with its own rage, and intoxicated with the first hope of victory. The three strangers who, bare-headed, still held their ground with their backs to the wall were obviously getting exhausted. But a little more determination--five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> respite before the arrival of the guard, a few more stones skilfully hurled and the Papists, Spaniards or Spies--whatever they were--would have paid dearly for their impudent interference. \"Papists, have ye had enough?\" yelled the crowd in chorus as a stone well thrown hit the sword arm of the tallest of the three men--he whose mocking voice had never ceased its incessant chatter. \"Not nearly enough,\" he replied loudly, as he quietly transferred faithful Bucephalus from...", "...attended to the lighter affairs of life in the sale of stock and the buying of a reaping machine, and now he was ready for the more serious business of theological discussion.

Next station a minister entered, and the moment my fellow-passenger saw the white tie his eyes glistened, and in about three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they were actively engaged, the farmer and the Minister, discussing the doctrine of justification. The Minister, as in duty bound, took the side of justification by faith, and the farmer, simply I suppose to make debate and certainly with a noble disregard of personal interests--for he had evidently dined--took the side of works. Perhaps it may seem as if it was an unequal match between the Minister and the farmer, since the one was a professional scholar and the other a rustic...", "...the honda, well down, held the noose open, and the beautiful bay fairly ran his head into it. Instantly he wheeled to dash off at right angles. I braced myself with the rope around my hip and brought him to a sudden stand. Rearing and struggling, he fought for his liberty while Nobs, panting and with lolling tongue, came and threw himself down near me. He seemed to know that his work was done and that he had earned his rest. The stallion was pretty well spent, and after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of struggling he stood with feet far spread, nostrils dilated and eyes wide, watching me as I edged toward him, taking in the slack of the rope as I advanced. A dozen times he reared and tried to break away; but always I spoke soothingly to him and after an hour of effort I succeeded in reaching his head and stroking his muzzle. Then I gathered a handful of grass and offered it to him, and always I talked to him in a quiet and reassuring voice. I had expected a battle...", "...of youth and high spirits. An occasional trunk lay across our way, and these we cleared at a leap; a feat, which I well saw my Hungarian friends were somewhat surprised to perceive, gave me no trouble whatever. My old habits of the riding-school had made me a perfect horseman; and rather vain of my accomplishment, I rode at the highest fences I could find. In one of these exploits an acute pang shot through me, and I felt as if something had given way in my leg. The pain for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> was so intense that I could with difficulty keep the saddle, and even when it had partially subsided, the suffering was very great. To continue my journey in this agony was impossible; and yet I was reluctant to confess that I was overcome by pain. Such an acknowledgment seemed unsoldier-like and unworthy, and I determined not to give way. It was no use; the suffering brought on a sickly faintness that completely overcame me. I had nothing for it but to turn back; so,...", "...to them respectively upon the paper before me. As an additional consideration for adhering to the regulation, I will mention that members of the committee have informed me that, having made engagements to be at the departments and elsewhere on business appointments, they will be compelled to leave the committee-room upon the expiration of the time assigned.

Mrs. MCRAE said: _Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen of the Judiciary Committee_: In Indiana the cause of woman has made marked advancement. At the same time we realize that we need the right to vote in order that we may have protection.

The little girl kept tugging the woman's hand and saying, \"Oh! do come to the fireworks.\" \"Yes if you like,--what will you give?\" I agreed to give I think three sovereigns, a good round sum for a common-place poke then. She told me to go out of the gardens first, get a cab, and stop at a little way from the entrance. In three minutes the woman and child joined me. At about five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> drive from Vauxhall we stopped, walked a little way, turned down a street, and after telling me to wait one or two minutes, she opened the door of a respectable little house with a latch-key, went in and closed it. A minute afterwards she opened the door, and treading lightly as she told me, I found myself in a parlour out of which led a bed-room, both well furnished. Enjoining me to speak in a low tone I sat down, and contemplated the couple. The woman was stout, full-sized,...", "...animal, dead or alive; take good aim, and fire; and we, that is I myself and the bravest men here, will guard you with our hoes; and, _morgue!_ if he comes at us, we'll give him a warm reception.\" The mayor's speech revived the courage of the villagers; they formed in line and stood with upraised hoes, ready to strike. Latouche finally decided to fire, although he was not at all eager to do so. He stood behind the line, passed the barrel of his gun between two peasants, spent five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> taking aim, and at last pulled the trigger--and the gun missed fire, luckily for Dubourg, who had no suspicion of the danger he had escaped. The mayor was in despair, Latouche refused to try again, and the peasants made no motion. Suddenly our sleeper turned over, with a yawn which everybody took for a roar. Instantly the most courageous dropped their weapons and fled, pushing and crowding one another, and listening to nothing but their fright; the boys tumbled over the...", "...is celebrating my birthday,\" said Joe. \"Of course the weather must be good to-day.\" As the boys tramped on they passed a number of small milk carts bringing barrels of fresh, rich milk into the city. The milk had been sent down from the high mountain pastures, where the cattle spend the summer months. Each milk cart was drawn by two strong dogs and a man. The dogs seemed very proud of their work. They knew every house where they must stop to leave the morning's milk. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the party was crossing a queer, crooked bridge over the river. It is called the Chapel Bridge. On its roof and walls there are more than one hundred and fifty pictures, which were painted a long, long time ago. Right beside the bridge, standing in the river, is a very old stone tower. The schoolmaster said that this tower was probably once used as a lighthouse. The Overall Boys were very much interested in the quaint old covered bridge, but they were even more interested...", "...need to pursue our plans further, where you are concerned.\" \"We are interested, of course,\" said Jeter. \"We are interested in your theories, without committing ourselves to acceptance of them; and we are naturally interested in saving our lives.

Remembering Kress, Jeter and Eyer did not need to ask him. There was but one alternative--death--a particularly horrible one. That Sitsumi and the Three would not hesitate was amply proved. Already they were guilty of the death of thousands. They were in deadly earnest with their scheme for a world government.

The Main land between this and the Island of Mowtohara, which is 10 Leagues, is of a moderate height, and all a level, flat Country, pretty clear of wood and full of Plantations and Villiages. These Villiages are built upon Eminences Near the Sea, and are Fortified on the land side with a Bank and a Ditch, and Pallisaded all round. Besides this, some of them appear'd to have out-works. We have before now observed, on several parts of the Coast, small Villiages inclosed...", "...altogether.\" Erskine laughed genially and waited to hear his mother say that of course that was of no consequence; but she did not speak. The cheerful voice of his wife went on:-- \"Nettie Langham has the sweetest little home, Erskine. If you could see it, you would never say again that cottages were only nice on paper. I'm sure I long to prove to you how perfectly charming one could be. And we have such a host of pretty things that would fit into it. Will Langham says he saves ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> night and morning by being at that end of the town instead of this.\" Erskine chose to ignore the cottage. \"You had an afternoon of calls, had you not?

M. D'Obsonville thought that he had discovered the secret in the blood, and that the change of colour depended upon a mixture of blue and yellow, whence the different shades of green were derived; and these colours he obtains from the blood and the blood-vessels. Thus he says that the blood is of a violet hue, and will retain its colour on linen or paper for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> if previously steeped in a solution of alum, and that the coats of the vessels are yellow; consequently, he argues, that the mixture of the two will produce green. He further traces the change of colour to the passions of the animal. Thus, when a healthy Chameleon is provoked, the circulation is accelerated, the vessels that are spread over the skin are distended, and a superficial blue-green colour is produced. When, on the contrary, the animal is imprisoned, impoverished, and...", "...was any one in the vicinity, and was feeling of his limbs to ascertain the amount of injury done, when a shrill, tremulous voice from the doorway cried,-- \"Jack! Jack dear! Are you hurt much?\" \"I'm afraid I'm shot. It seems as if I was bleedin' dreadful!\" \"Wait till I can light the lantern, my poor boy\"; and the door was closed and locked again. By this time Jack had fully persuaded himself he was seriously wounded, and wondered how long it would be before the pain came. Two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later Aunt Nancy, partially dressed and with an odd little lantern in her hand, emerged very cautiously from the house. The fear Jack might be fatally injured was greater than that of the supposed burglars. Her desire to aid others conquered her timidity, and the only thought was to bring relief as speedily as possible. \"Mercy on us! What a dreadful thing!\" Aunt Nancy exclaimed as she arrived at the place where Jack was lying at full length on the ground. \"Tell me where you...", "...king, perceiving him through the half-closed door, said, \"What do you want, M. de Bragelonne?\" The young man approached: \"An audience, sire,\" he replied, \"for the Comte de la Fere, who has just arrived from Blois, and is most anxious to have an interview with your majesty.\" \"I have an hour to spare between cards and supper,\" said the king. \"Is the Comte de la Fere at hand?\" \"He is below, and awaits your majesty's permission.\" \"Let him come up at once,\" said the king, and five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards Athos entered the presence of Louis XIV. He was received by the king with that gracious kindness of manner which Louis, with a tact beyond his years, reserved for the purpose of gaining those who were not to be conquered by ordinary favors. \"Let me hope, comte,\" said the king, \"that you have come to ask me for something.\" \"I will not conceal from your majesty,\" replied the comte, \"that I am indeed come for that purpose.\" \"That is well,\" said the king,...", "...struck by the excellence of the suggestion; \"let's have a few games.

When the trio entered the _salle de jeu_ a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, they found the tables crowded with players indulging in some innocent games of chance. Play is never high at Spa nowadays. The room was neither large nor luxurious. A few busts stood upon pedestals around the mirrored walls, the card-tables were ranged down the side, and at the further end was a _chemin de fer_, which proved the chief source of attraction to the less venturesome. The incessant tick-tack of the tiny train and the jingling of money, mingled with the...", "...will not suit me at all.\" It was one of those pretty bits of sunshine that sometimes shew themselves in the midst of a very unpromising day, the time when they sat there with the lunch basket between them. The refreshment of talk and of lunch (for lunch _is_ refreshing when it is needed) brightened both faces and voices; and Mr. Linden's little charge, in one of his turns of happy rest and ease, watched them--amused and interested--till he fell asleep. By that time Mr. Linden's spare <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> were about over.

One glance sufficed to show the trapper that his services there were not required. He also observed that the fresh tracks which he had been following circled round the body of the seaman and then led straight on. Following these, Bellew soon came to an open circular space at the head of the gorge, where the appearance of smoke, rising from among the trees, arrested his attention. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he had reached the spot whence it issued, and there to his surprise found Mr Bob Smart with five of his men and several Indians standing in solemn silence round something on the ground that appeared to rivet their attention. Some of the men looked up as Bellew approached and nodded to him, for the trapper was well-known in the district; they also moved aside and let him pass. \"What's wrong, Mr Smart?\" he asked, on coming up.

There are two kinds of bolters--those who run away for the sheer love of running, and those who from hilltops pick out the country that looks like containing birds, and make for that country of their own sweet will. Arnold's Drake belonged to the latter class. The girl was looking for him in the \"birdy\" spots. But heaven only knew how far he had taken it into his head to go! Old Burton got out his handkerchief and mopped his face. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed, then ten--and still Arnold's Drake was lost, and out yonder the judges waited. Then across the field toward the group in the woods came the girl. Off to the side of these woods were extensive fields of broom straw that lay outside the course. But they looked \"birdy,\" those fields, and the girl was making for them. As she swept past, Burton glimpsed her face. It was tense with anxiety, but the little mouth was set in a straight line. Her pony was flecked with foam;...", "...But it is quite true. Harry Brett is not in the least like you. He says just what he thinks.\" \"Does he? Lucky man! That is just what I am always trying to do. And he tells you all about the Darches, does he?\" \"Oh no! He has never told me anything. But then, he would.\" \"That is just the same, you know.\" \"What makes you think there is anything wrong?\" asked Vanbrugh, changing his tone and growing serious in his turn. \"So many things--it is dreadful! What o'clock is it?\" \"Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to one.\" \"Have you time for another turn before I go in?\" \"Of course--all the time. We can walk round Gramercy Park and down Irving Place.\" Instinctively both were silent as they passed the door of Marion Darche's house and did not resume their conversation till they were twenty paces further down the street. Then Vanbrugh was the first to speak. \"If it is possible for you and me to talk seriously about anything, Miss Maylands, I should like to speak to you about the...", "...time the food is found to be moist, it must be subjected to the drying process for a short time.

Dead!\" he repeated, with a bewildered air. He stared at those fixed eyes, that grim mouth, that livid flesh, and that blood--all that blood which had flowed over the carpet and congealed there in thick, black spots. He arose and turned on the electric lights. Then he beheld all the marks of a desperate struggle. The bed was in a state of great disorder. On the floor, the candlestick, and the clock, with the hands pointing to twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after eleven; then, further away, an overturned chair; and, everywhere, there was blood, spots of blood and pools of blood. \"And the black pearl?\" he murmured. The box of letter-paper was in its place. He opened it, eagerly. The jewel-case was there, but it was empty. \"Fichtre!\" he muttered. \"You boasted of your good fortune much too soon, my friend Lupin. With the countess lying cold and dead, and the black pearl vanished, the situation is anything but pleasant.

The boat dropped from the davits, and went plashing through the waves as fast as sinew and muscle could send her. \"We're all jolly,\" bawled Dick Selmes, \"only look sharp. It's beastly cold.\" The words, audible to those on the ship, raised a laugh that rounded off into a mighty cheer, as the boat was seen to gain its objective and the three were hoisted in. \"Thirteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> from the time of going over the side,\" said the officer in charge of the ship, closing his watch with a snap. \"Not bad time that, sir?\" \"No. It's good,\" said the captain, who, half asleep in his cabin, had been roused by the uproar and had quickly ascended to the bridge. \"Drowned rat Number One,\" sang out Dick Selmes, shoving the cause of all the bother in front of him, as they gained the deck.

There must be a bridge down there among those thick trees and bushes,\" Jack said, excitedly. \"Are you sure, sergeant, that is the same man that was in the woods to the right there, five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago?\" Jack turned; the officer was at his shoulder. He saluted respectfully, recognizing, with a thrill of joy, old Red Top, as the company called Sherman. \"Yes, colonel, it's the same man. He was in his shirtsleeves and had a blue scarf tied about his arm. There can be no mistake; several of us saw him quite plainly.\" \"If that be true, we've gained a half-day's work in two minutes.\" He was looking diligently through the glass as he spoke, and his eye brightened as he...", "...just take and--\" And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy --pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. \"Oh, you do, do you? You holler 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!\" And so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction. Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absent-mindedness followed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept exclaiming: \"Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this!\" she lost patience at last, and...", "...That makes First and Second Seniors and Middlers tied for first so far.

It was getting dim now, and when, after five or six <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had passed, more runners reached the fence it was impossible to identify them. But when they drew near a shout went up. Two of them were First Seniors, one was a Middler and one a Junior. The First Seniors needed but one more runner now to give them the cup.

He was already standing on the floor, wrapped in a large gown lined with furs; and his piercing eye scanned carefully the face of each man that approached. Two of the Barons of the Frangipani family exhibited some tokens of confusion and embarrassment, from which they speedily recovered at the frank salutation of the Tribune.

Adams and Gushing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs; for all papers relating to McLeod, and for the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of the committee on Foreign Affairs, to show that Mr. Webster had expressed an opinion adverse to our claim in the Oregon dispute. Mr. Ingersoll closed his speech by a threat of impeachment as the result and reward of all this evil-doing, and an angry debate followed, in which Mr. Webster was attacked and defended with equal violence. President Polk replied to the call of the House by saying that he could not feel justified, either morally or legally, in revealing the uses of...", "...I'd like to hear,\" replied Dam. (Must keep the animal talking as long as possible for the sake of human company. He'd go mad at once, perhaps, when the Corporal went to bed.) \"I'd frow it strite in 'is faice, I would,\" announced the virtuous youth. A big boot flopped heavily on the floor. \"I daresay you come of good old teetotal stock,\" observed Dam, to make conversation. Perhaps the fellow would pause in his assault upon the other boot and reply--so lengthening out the precious <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of diversion.

In some fifteen or twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he began to show signs of returning animation, and soon afterwards, to our great relief, he opened his eyes. At first he looked about him in a bewildered way, and then he seemed to recollect his whereabouts. After an ineffectual attempt to speak, and move his limbs, he fixed his eyes with a meaning expression on the engines. We had forgotten their stoppage. Miss Carmichael sprang to investigate the cause. \"They are jammed,\" she said after a short inspection. \"The...", "...and if he was put into any other position he behaved so unpleasantly to his neighbors, and so generally upset things, that he was quickly shifted. A more perfect sledge-dog could scarcely be imagined. He seemed to know the meaning of every move, and in camp would be still as a graven image until he saw the snow being shoveled from the skirting of the tent, when he would spring up and pace to and fro at his picket, and give a low throaty bark of welcome if anyone approached him. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, when the leading man came to uproot his picket, he would watch every movement, and a slow wagging of the tail quite obviously showed his approval: then, as the word came to start, he would push affectionately against the leader, as much as to say, 'Now come along!' and brace his powerful chest to the harness. At the evening halt after a long day he would drop straight in his tracks and remain perfectly still, with his magnificent black head resting on his paws.

But come on, thou brave dwarf!\" Scarcely had he spoken, when he felt a shock which almost sent him reeling from his saddle, and made Greyfell plunge about with fright. Quickly, then, did Siegfried dismount, and, with every sense alert, he waited for the second onset of the unseen dwarf. It was plain that Alberich wished to strike him unawares, for many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed in utter silence. Then a brisk breath of wind passed by Siegfried's face, and he felt another blow; but, by a quick downward movement of his hand, he caught the plucky elf-king, and tore off the magic Tarnkappe, and then, with firm grasp, he held him, struggling in vain to get free. \"Ah, Alberich!\" he cried, \"now I know thou art cunning. But the Tarnkappe I must have for my own.

A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after, as Babadul was pondering over the strangeness of his situation, and just recovering from the effects of this apparition, a door opened in another part of the apartment, and a mysterious figure, richly dressed, came in, bearing a bundle, equally covered with a shawl, about the size of that which had just been taken away; and making the lowest prostrations before the tailor, in great apparent trepidation, approached him, placed it at his feet, kissed the ground, and...", "...lining was a little less gaudy than red and gold plaid.

As small as MacLeod's Landing was by human standards, it was already large by Irschchan, and still growing.

She had been walking for perhaps five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> when a Sanctioner patrol cruiser sped past her, toward Thark's home. The wind of its passage ruffled her fur as well as her kilt, but they seemed to pay no attention to her, for which she was grateful. Still, it was what she had hoped. If she were obvious enough, the Sanctioners should think she had nothing to hide. Between that and her kilt-flipping, unless she ran into a Sanctioner who knew her well enough to identify her by the pattern of her mind-shield, she might...", "...on wagons to the train.

All the men there were in business and talked and acted like a company of young American business men. My first hint that these men had been through any trying experience was the apology offered by a new-comer for being late.

Instead of bowling away for two or three miles and getting clear out of the danger zone and hiding in the nearest timber, what do they do? They foolishly stop on the other side of the field, or in the next acre of brush, in full view of the hunters and dogs, who find it great fun to hustle after them and in fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> put them up again. Thus it is easy for a hunting party to \"follow up\" a covey until the last bird of it has been bagged.

The pedlar turned into the lodge at Fairmile before approaching the house, and conversed for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with Mrs. Chitterley, who was very much at her ease with him; for scarcely had he spoken three words before she discovered that this dusty hawker was the London gentleman, Lord Lavendale's friend, who had been so liberal in his bounties to her and her children. \"You knew my voice, Mrs. Chitterley; but do you think the good people up at the house yonder will recognise me?\" \"Not unless they hear you talk, sir; I took you for a stranger when you came in at the door just now....", "...Accordingly, when the time of this festival revolved, he, as usual, ordered Wilhelmina to surrender it for the day.

With an air of uncommon cheerfulness, purposely assumed, she retired to her closet, on pretence of complying with his desire, and, having employed a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in rummaging her drawers and disordering her moveables, uttered a loud shriek, that brought her father instantly into the apartment, where he found his daughter tossing about her clothes and trinkets with violent demonstrations of disorder and affright, and heard her, in a lamentable strain, declare that she was robbed of her chain, and for ever undone.

However, few as the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> were during which I gazed down this tremendous and even wondrous shaft, I had a sufficient glimpse of it to give me some idea of its physical conformation. Its sides, which were almost as perpendicular as those of a well, presented numerous projections which doubtless would assist our descent.

Presently along came the fox, and, making a leap to one side, ran up the trunk of a fallen tree which had lodged some feet from the ground, and concealed himself in the top. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the hounds came up, and in their eagerness passed some distance beyond the point, and then went still farther, looking for the lost trail. Then the fox hastened down, and, taking his back-track, fooled the dogs completely.

No cover for a rabbit. There was no escaping the pitiless rain of machine-gun bullets poured on to the enemy from a low height, or the bombs which soon reduced the head of the column to chaos.

For many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after Madeline had finished her recital, she sat staring straight before her, like a statue. At length she arose and crossed to the door, drew back the bolt with a steady hand, put up a warning finger, and said, in a voice like frozen silver: \"Wait;\" then disappeared. Madeline scarcely had time to wonder what she meant, before Claire was back, standing before her, calm and cold as an iceberg. She held in her hand the picture of Edward Percy, with the face turned away, and...", "...approve of this, could not very well object, and the two sallied forth together. Walking a short distance up Piccadilly, they struck off into a bye street, and soon reached the house they were in search of. Sir Norman knocked loudly at the door, which was opened by the doctor himself. Briefly and rapidly Sir Norman informed him how and where his services were required; and the doctor being always provided with everything necessary for such cases, set out with him immediately. Fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after leaving his own house, Sir Norman was back there again, and standing in his own chamber. But a simultaneous exclamation of amazement and consternation broke from him and Ormiston, as on entering the room they found the bed empty, and the lady gone! A dead pause followed, during which the three looked blankly at the bed, and then at each other. The scene, no doubt, would have been ludicrous enough to a third party; but neither of our trio could saw anything whatever to...", "...goat, for after a little laughing and jesting, one of the men took a pail and approached Garibaldi. Now, no one had ever milked Garibaldi in all her life but Lucia, and from the disastrous attempts on the part of the soldiers it was evident that no one was ever going to, if that very particular animal could prevent it, and she seemed quite able to, to judge from the results. Lucia watching through the cracks in the shed laughed softly to herself. She was not surprised when, a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, one of the men opened the door and told her to come out. He could not speak Italian and he resorted to the sign language. Lucia nodded in understanding. She might have pretended blank stupidity, but she wanted some milk herself, and this was a good way to get it. Besides, she decided that she would do something to make it impossible for them to lock her up again on her return. Garibaldi stood quite still as she milked her, and submitted meekly to her affectionate...", "...an East India Company, or any thing else that they deemed profitable.

A wounded bird will create as much stir in a flock of crows as a railroad accident does in a village. But when some prowling old crow discovers an owl sleeping away the sunlight in the top of a great hemlock, his delight and excitement know no bounds. There is a suppressed frenzy in his very call that every crow in the neighborhood understands. _Come! come! everybody come!_ he seems to be screaming as he circles over the tree-top; and within two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> there are more crows gathered about that old hemlock than one would believe existed within miles of the place. I counted over seventy one day, immediately about a tree in which one of them had found an owl; and I think there must have been as many more flying about the outskirts that I could not count. At such times one can approach very near with a little caution, and attend, as it were, a crow caucus.

We enjoyed this. It showed that the Rebels were terribly alarmed, and we began to feel some of that confidence that \"Sherman will come out all right,\" which so marvelously animated all under his command.

OFF TO CHARLESTON--PASSING THROUGH THE RICE SWAMPS--TWO EXTREMES OF SOCIETY--ENTRY INTO CHARLESTON--LEISURELY WARFARE--SHELLING THE CITY AT REGULAR INTERVALS--WE CAMP IN A MASS OF RUINS--DEPARTURE FOR FLORENCE. The train started in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the close of the conversation with the old Georgian, and we soon came to and crossed the Savannah River into South Carolina. The river was wide and apparently deep; the tide was setting back in a swift, muddy current; the crazy old bridge creaked and shook, and the grinding axles shrieked in the dry journals, as we pulled across. It looked very much at times as if we were to all crash down into the turbid flood--and we did not care very much if we did, if we were not...", "...of water, with a lighted tobacco pipe in the top of it, and a pliant stem a yard long, with a brass mouth-piece to it. It was the famous \"narghili\" of the East--the thing the Grand Turk smokes in the pictures. This began to look like luxury. I took one blast at it, and it was sufficient; the smoke went in a great volume down into my stomach, my lungs, even into the uttermost parts of my frame. I exploded one mighty cough, and it was as if Vesuvius had let go. For the next five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I smoked at every pore, like a frame house that is on fire on the inside. Not any more narghili for me. The smoke had a vile taste, and the taste of a thousand infidel tongues that remained on that brass mouthpiece was viler still. I was getting discouraged. Whenever, hereafter, I see the cross-legged Grand Turk smoking his narghili, in pretended bliss, on the outside of a paper of Connecticut tobacco, I shall know him for the shameless humbug he is. This prison was...", "...box and waited; then noting the Englishman's look, said wistfully: \"I had one yesterday, but it,--it is gone.

Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards Raheem was putting three rupees into the bag. He had sold out his stock, and, still more wonderful, had a promise of twenty rupees more on account for future work if he brought the comb punctually on the Monday evening. He had not done such a business for years. The Eed-offering was secure, and the chances of his hoard reaching the necessary amount for a speedy pilgrimage doubled. The sun shone brighter and purer than ever on the crowds assembled in the...", "...say a man-eating plant. This doubtless has been the fate of these birds, whose bones now lie bleaching at its feet after they have nourished its lips with their lives. No doubt the plant has use for them still, since their skeletons may serve to fertilize its roots.\" Wishing to investigate further, Bearwarden placed one of the birds they had shot within the bell of another flower, which immediately contracted with such force that they saw drops of blood squeezed out. After some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the flower opened, as beautiful as ever, and discharged an oblong ball compressed to about the size of a hen's egg, though the bird that was placed within it had been as large as a small duck. Towards evening these flowers sent up their most beautiful song, to hear which flocks of birds came from far and near, alighting on the trees, and many were lured to death by the siren strains and the honey. Before resuming their journey, the travellers paid a parting visit to the...", "...Johnny Leeds' grocery store a leetle while back.

The purple mists hanging over the headlands are glowing with the first rays of the sun and the pale emerald waters flash into burnished gold as the low beams strike along their surface. The voyage has been an easy one; our tickets were purchased, our cabin reserved, and provision made for the transport of the motor, all in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at the office of the Royal Automobile Club in London, and the genial touring-secretary, Mr. Maroney, has supplied us with necessary maps and information.

It must be a wolf or a man.\" I ordered him to move towards the unknown object, which came also to meet us. In two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I saw it was a man, and we met. \"Hey, there, good man,\" the driver hailed him, \"tell us, do you happen to know the road?\" \"This is the road,\" replied the traveller. \"I am on firm ground; but what the devil good does that do you?\" \"Listen, my little peasant,\" said I to him, \"do you know this part of the country?

Whether I was quite beyond rule I cannot say; but it did not lack more than ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of eleven when I was ushered up stairs, and I found all the company assembled. However, it is of little consequence, except that if I had come early, I should have been introduced to many of the guests, whom now I could only know across the table.

With a throbbing heart and trembling hand, Mrs. Hamilton raised her repentant child, and with the assistance of Emmeline placed her tenderly on the nearest couch, endeavouring, though for some few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in vain, to recall her scattered senses. Tears fell from that fond mother's eyes upon Caroline's deathlike features, and ere life returned she had been pressed again and again to her heart, and repeated kisses imprinted on her marble brow.

Soon the flames were shooting up forty or fifty feet high and the roaring was like that of a mighty tempest. The heat quickly grew so intense that the boys were compelled to retreat slowly back to the machine. Even there the heat could be felt, although it was a thousand feet to the jungle and the wind was blowing the fire away from them. The engineer stopped the machine for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to give all hands a chance to view the wonderful sight. As the pillars of flame and smoke reared themselves skyward, the boys realized with astonishment that the jungle that had seemed so lifeless was really teeming with life.

At seven o'clock I proceeded with Mr. Cunningham to the summit of a cone, bare of timber, which I had observed from the Canobolas, and which bore 138 degrees east of north from our camp, distant about six miles. The ascent was easy, and from the summit (on which Mr. Cunningham obligingly erected a pyramid) I obtained many valuable angles with my theodolite on the very distant hills which broke the western horizon.

Dorsenne did not indulge in his usual pastime of examining the souvenirs along the streets which met his eye, and yet he passed in the twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> which it took him to reach his rendezvous a number of buildings teeming with centuries of historical reminiscences. There was first of all the vast Palais Borghese--the piano of the Borghese, as it has been called, from the form of a clavecin adopted by the architect--a monument of splendor, which was, less than two years later, to serve as the scene of a situation more melancholy than that of the Palais Castagna.

Magdalen lay awake some time longer. In a half-dreamy way she was thinking over in her own mind the old fairy tales she had loved as a little girl--with them there mingled in her fancy the scenes and memories of her own childhood.

As he said this he climbed on to the manuals, and disappeared into the heart of the organ. And Johan noticed that the sun had risen and that the sacristan was opening the cathedral for early Mass. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later Frantz walked up into the organ loft, and Johan asked him to draw the stops of Vox Angelica and Lieblich Gedacht together and alone.

It is convenient to plot the results in curves; the nitrogen is generally given in cubic centimetres or in milligrammes, and readings taken every fifteen minutes. The steepness of the curve is a measure of the stability of the nitro-cellulose which is being examined. The steeper the curve the more nitrogen...", "...Then quoting her: \"'And after they had shot up all the peaceable people in the town, they fell to killing each other, and'--Don't let me spoil the dramatic conclusion.\" \"You are the dramatic conclusion to that story,\" retorted Miss Brewster, reproachfully. Whereupon she immediately wrenched the conversation aside into a new channel by asking how far it was to the canyon portal. \"Only a mile or two now,\" was Lidgerwood's rejoinder. \"Williams has been making good time.\" And two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the one-car train, with the foaming torrent of the Timanyoni for its pathfinder, plunged between the narrow walls of the upper canyon, and the race down the grade of the crooked water-trail through the heart of the mountains began. There was little chance for speech, even if the overawing grandeurs of the stupendous crevice, seen in their most impressive presentment as alternating vistas of stark, moonlighted crags and gulches and depths of blackest shadow, had...", "...its aspect from pained indifference to something like bashful interest, interspersed with small tremors and shudders of a trifling kind. In the centre of each pale cheek a small red spot the size of a wafer had now made its appearance, and continued to grow larger. Elfride momentarily expected a recurrence to the lecture on her foolishness, but Knight said no more than this-- 'Promise me NEVER to walk on that parapet again.' 'It will be pulled down soon: so I do.' In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she continued in a lower tone, and seriously, 'You are familiar of course, as everybody is, with those strange sensations we sometimes have, that our life for the moment exists in duplicate.' 'That we have lived through that moment before?' 'Or shall again. Well, I felt on the tower that something similar to that scene is again to be common to us both.' 'God forbid!' said Knight. 'Promise me that you will never again walk on any such place on any consideration.' 'I...", "...to spring, suddenly threw up his hands, swirled round, and fell face upwards in a crumpled heap. There was an instant's scare in the crowd, in that hundred and fifty or more of troopers and conspirators, thrown into black and white relief, like a shadow pantomime, about the outer gate. Then the startled murmurs of \"the light--the _Dee-puk-rag_\" which were passing from lip to lip, changed into a yell. The fight had begun in earnest. \"Shoot straight,\" remarked Dr. Dillon, a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after, \"we shan't have such a good chance long. The gate is almost gone. Then most of the game will be out of range--too close to the wall. And once they get into the tunnel we shall have to sound _cease firing_ until they come out on the other side; but then we ought to do decent damage, if the prisoners don't get at us first.\" He paused, and shot on steadily till, with a hoarse shout, the attackers surged inwards. Then he laid his rifle aside, remarking that it would be as...", "...the side to dissolve the pellet for the shot. When, finally, the task was completed and the syringe duly charged, he did not again bare the girl's arm for an injection. Now that his stock was running low, perhaps his selfishness forbade any bestowal of the drug on another; or, perhaps, his trained eye told him that the further stupefying of her would react dangerously. So, the liquid in its entirety was forced into his own arm through the needle's puncture. It was only a matter of a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before the efficacy of the drug was made manifest. The nervousness that had marked the physician's manner fell away from him. His countenance wore a serene aspect. Presently he settled himself comfortably on an upholstered seat and then without more ado fell sound asleep. Garnet did not awaken until the shades of night were fast settling over the waters. In all probability, he would have slumbered on much longer, had it not been for his acutely sensitive hearing, which caught...", "...furiously, I waited on the wharf and watched its development. The cloud spread until the whole dome was covered in by it, and the fierce glare took a strange greenish tinge. All around the edge of the darkness ran an incessant tangle of vari-coloured lightnings, and a continual rumble of thunder seemed to make the earth vibrate. Suddenly the storm burst. Jamming myself into a corner between some posts, whence I felt sure no wind could dislodge me, I waited and watched. For the first few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I thought I should have died of fright. Torrents of water, like the fall of a sea, were lashed into foam as they fell, and all torn into gleaming fragments by innumerable flashes flying in every conceivable direction. An overpowering smell like burning sulphur pervaded all. As for the wind, its force must have been frightful, judging from its effect upon the shipping and houses; but where I stood only a very strong gale could be felt, such as no seaman would think...", "...the intervening period would be allowed to come. This announcement created great excitement, and the school set itself to be good; but marks were easy to get, and gradually one girl after another lost her chance, till by the appointed day only a limited party descended to join the festivities, and nearly half the school was left upstairs to sigh over past sins. Katy and Rose were among the unlucky ones. Rose had incurred a mark by writing a note in study-hour, and Katy by being five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> late to dinner. They consoled themselves by dressing Clover's hair, and making her look as pretty as possible, and then stationed themselves in the upper hall at the head of the stairs to watch her career, and get as much fun out of the occasion as they could. Pretty soon they saw Clover below on Professor Seccomb's arm. He was a kingly, pleasant man, with a bald head, and it was a fashion among the girls to admire him. \"Doesn't she look pretty?\" said Rose. \"Just notice...", "...passing of the laws.\" Suddenly there fell upon his ear the muffled sound of a cheer raised by countless voices. The smile upon his lips grew scornful: \"The King!\" he muttered, \"greeting his good Parliament. 'Tis said he loves a well-timed jest; pity to rob England of such a famous clown; perchance in hell the devil may use his wit to while away the dinner hour.\" The noise above increased; the peers had entered the hall; the King had ascended the throne, and it lacked but fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to the first stroke of eleven, when the Parliament would open--and the flint would kiss the steel. Despite his hardihood the man waiting in the gloom beneath the feet of the sovereign and his noblemen grew restless as the fatal moment approached. Through his brain flashed thoughts of the fearful consequence of his bloody deed,--the terror, the widespread consternation and the chaos which would follow the destruction of the Parliament. To him came, also, the thought of his...", "...men, and exterminate these Feringhees before the others can come back to their assistance.\" The Sepoys were now the assailants, and with furious shouts pressed round the little body of British troops. \"Steady, men, steady,\" Captain Mallett shouted, as he drove his sword through the body of one of the rebel leaders who rushed at him. \"Keep together, back to back. We shall have help here in a minute.\" It was longer than that, however, before relief came. For three or four <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a desperate struggle went on, then Marshall's voice was heard shouting: \"This way, men, this way!\" A moment later there was a surging movement in the ranks of the insurgents, and with a dozen men Marshall burst through them, and joined the party. These at once fell furiously upon the mutineers, and the latter were already giving way when some fifty of the Punjaubies, led by their officers, fell upon them. The effect was decisive. The Sepoys scattered at once, and fled...", "...plateau, for now I had even greater cause not to incur needless risks. After supper I sought my seat of the night before, my mind made up. Again I saw the moon creep up the sky, and it was full that night; its immense disk was a perfect circle. I sat watching the grotesque, ever-changing shapes evolved from my pipe smoke, silvery luminous in the moonshine, and wondering just how and where I would begin my search in the morning. Then my unchecked thoughts drifted to Celeste, and as the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> glided by I felt the restraint which I had placed upon myself slipping more and more. I made no effort to stay my imaginings, or to turn their trend. The hour was made delicious by this mental revel; by sublime visions of what the future would be. Most rigidly had I held myself in check since that night on the peak, when I woke to a sense of my condition, and whither it was leading me. Now I would relax, and suffer my feelings to assume predominance again, for I was weary of...", "...was in a terrible state of disorder, having, apparently, never been touched since its mistress lay down, which Mabel learned was about three weeks ago. Her husband was away at the pit, she said, and the little boy who had brought Mabel was her eldest child. An infant of about four months old slept beside her, and two other children of about two and three years of age respectively sprawled on the floor, screaming with all the strength of their united lungs. After speaking for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to the poor woman, Mabel decided that she could do nothing until the noise was stopped, and after many unsuccessful efforts, at last had the satisfaction of seeing the two drop off to sleep, thoroughly exhausted with crying. She then turned her attention to the sick woman, whom she found to be in a very weak state indeed. She told Mabel that the doctor had visited her that morning, and had thought it his duty to tell her that she had only a very few days more to live. Mabel...", "...he'll be in Keller's office in nothing flat.\" \"O.K., Tug. Tell Drake that the shell he rejected are going to stay rejected, and to come in right now with his report. Would you like to come along?\" \"_Would_ I!\" Tugwell hung up and: \"But do you want _him_ here, Doc?\" Celeste asked, anxiously, without considering whether or not her boss would approve of her eavesdropping. \"I certainly do. If I can keep Tug from blowing his top, the rest of the boys will stay in line.\" A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later Tugwell strode in, bringing with him Drake, the Chief Line Inspector of the Nine Line. Shortly thereafter the office door was wrenched open. Keller had come to Kinnison, accompanied by the Superintendent whom the Siberians referred to, somewhat contemptuously, as \"Piddy.\" \"Damn your soul, Kinnison, come out here--I want to talk to you!\" Keller roared, and doors snapped open up and down the long corridor. \"Shut up, you God damned louse!\" This from Tugwell, who, black...", "...Sue accepted enthusiastically. \"That's fine. I've got to see that the ship is berthed properly.

If we get on as stewardesses, we'll have to know all of the pilots fairly well. Besides, think what a free breakfast means to our slender purses.\" Jane smiled. \"You would think of that.\" A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the pilot of their ship rejoined them. \"Say, I forgot to introduce myself,\" he chuckled. \"I'm Charlie Fischer.\" \"And I'm Jane Cameron and my friend is Sue Hawley.\" \"Now that everything's in order and we know who's who, let's eat.\" The flyer led the way into the modernistic restaurant which adjoined the waiting room and they sat down at gleaming black and silver tables. \"The sky's the limit,\" advised their new friend and Jane and Sue added bacon to their usual...", "...for a pretty face and figure--your indiscretions, ephemeral courtships, passing inclinations.

He was silent. \"Jim, dear,\" she said timidly, \"won't you give me ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> alone with you?\" He scarcely heard her. He spun the last parti-coloured ball into a corner pocket, straightened his shoulders, and looked at Jacqueline where she sat in the corner of the fireplace.

He guessed that his warriors had been discovered and a fight was in progress. He fretted and chafed at the chance that had denied him participation in it. Again and again he tried the doors of his prison and the trap in the center of the floor, but none would give to his utmost endeavors. He strained his eyes toward the aperture above but he could see nothing, and then he continued his futile pacing to and fro like a caged lion behind its bars. The <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> dragged slowly into hours. Faintly sounds came to him as of shouting men at a great distance. The battle was in progress. He wondered if Ja-don would be victorious and should he be, would his friends ever discover him in this hidden chamber in the bowels of the hill? He doubted it. And now as he looked again toward the aperture in the roof there appeared to be something depending through its center. He came closer and strained his eyes to see. Yes, there was something there....", "...books enables the store's customer to make purchases in its various departments with the least possible waiting.

Suppose I ask them to meet you there after lunch?\" There was a slight pause. \"Very well,\" Morris agreed, although he sounded a bit annoyed. After hanging up, Tom phoned Bud and asked him to keep the appointment. Bud was only too happy to oblige, jumping at the chance to take Sandy out to lunch beforehand. At one o'clock the husky young pilot and his date strolled into the yacht club lounge. Lester Morris was nowhere in sight, so they sat down to wait. Twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the musician still had not appeared. \"I hope he hasn't forgotten,\" Sandy said, glancing at her wrist watch. \"If he's a square-dance caller, his memory ought to be extra good,\" Bud joked. \"Fine thing if he can't even remember the time of day!\" After waiting a while longer, Bud decided to telephone Morris's home.

Her rooms were large and would be crowded; the duke would probably do little more than walk through them once, and Lady Lufton would certainly be surrounded by persons of her own class.

Gale could see him staring after his horse, but he made no effort to chase the animal as she had hoped he would.

Her ruse had failed. He didn't apparently care what happened to his horse. Now what was she going to do? Val needed help and she, Gale, must do something. She didn't have time to go for Jim or Tom.

Under ordinary circumstances the wolverene, with his dauntless courage and tremendous strength, would have given a good account of himself with any lynx alive. But this time, caught with head down and very busy, he stood small chance with his powerful and lightning-swift assailant.

None of them, on their return a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after him, had thought of looking in his tent; the three whose turn it was had each kept three hours' watch, and had no reason for supposing that anything unusual had occurred. It was not until eight o'clock, that one looking into Ben Hatcher's tent discovered that it was untenanted; the others were soon roused at the news, and Bluff Harry went down into the camp to see if he had gone down on some errand.

THE LAST SCENE. \"She does not know you,\" Dr. Burroughs said, when, a few hours later, Wyvis bent over his mother's pillow and looked into her quiet, care-lined face. \"Will she never know me?\" asked the young man in a tone of deep distress. \"My poor mother! I must tell her how sorry I am for the pain that I have often given her.\" \"She may be conscious for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> by-and-bye,\" the doctor said. \"But consciousness will only show that the end is near.\" There was a silence in the room. Mrs. Brand had now lain in a stupor for many hours. Wyvis had been greeted on his arrival with sad news indeed: his mother and wife were seriously ill, and the doctor acknowledged that he did not think Mrs. Brand likely to live for many hours. Wyvis had not been allowed to enter his wife's room, Juliet had to be kept very quiet, lest the haemorrhage should...", "...Have you a dog licence? Can you produce a boot and shoe grant? Do you hold any rubber shares? Have you been inoculated for premature decay? What did you do in the Great War?\" I gave him the necessary documents in perfect order. For a moment he was nonplussed.

I had selected for him a quiet old troop horse; and it was well I had done so, as when he started to mount he tumbled over on the other side, and when at last we got him into his saddle he gave endless trouble: first of all his stirrup leathers were too long, then too short, and he was such a noodle, unable to do anything for himself, that a man had to keep on dismounting every few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to render him assistance. Now there is no class of men in the world more respectful to clergy, of any denomination, than the up-country man, be he miner, farmer or trooper. A parson or priest is always made welcome at any camp he may choose to call at, and the best in that camp is placed at his disposal.

I'll give your message. Good-bye.\" The train glided away, and Tom started back for home with his mind busy for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> over the scene at Mornington Crescent; and then thoughts flew on to the mill and into the future, when perhaps some far greater telescope would be mounted, and nights occupied searching the heavens. Then Tom's thoughts came back to earth, and Pete Warboys' hole under the great pine-tree, and he was still busy over that, and the great gipsy-like boy's habits,--poaching, probably stealing, and making himself a nuisance to everybody,--when he caught sight of the lad himself...", "...It's time to be hustlin'!\" There was no answer, and Texas got up, yawning, and went to the other bed. \"Git up thar, you prize fighter you!\" And as he spoke he aimed a blow at the bed, and the next moment he started back in amazement, for his hand had touched nothing but a mattress, and Texas knew that the bed was empty. \"Wow!\" he muttered. \"He's gone without me!\" And with this thought in his mind he rushed to his watch to see if he were too late. No, it was just ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to four, and Texas started hastily to dress, wondering at the same time what on earth could have led Mark to go so early and without his friend. \"That was the goldurndest queer trick I ever did hear of in my life, by jingo!\" It took him but a few short moments to fling his clothes on; and then he stepped quickly across the hall and entered a room on the other side. \"I wonder if that Parson's gone with him,\" he muttered.

He resisted successfully for over half an hour the seductive call of the sea; and then went up to his room and changed into flannels, and did what for thirty odd <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he had been resolving he would not do--tramped out along the road to Three Anchor Bay. He had not the smallest hope of seeing Brenda Upton on the beach, or elsewhere; nevertheless he walked down to the beach, and peered about him, searching the dusk vainly for a sign of the small slender figure. He knew that it was not in the least likely that she would be walking about; but he looked for her none the less, with the dogged yet purposeless air of a man pursuing consciously an...", "...how it was that he who had never known his father should uphold so sternly the duty of filial obedience. I think it ought to act as a solemn warning to those who exact so much from the mere fact and name of parenthood, without having in any way fulfilled its duties, that orphans from birth often revere the ideal of that bond far more than those who have known it in reality. Always excepting those children to whose blessed lot it has fallen to have the ideal realized. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I saw him and my father enter the tan-yard together. He was talking earnestly, and my father was listening--ay, listening--and to John Halifax! But whatever the argument was, it failed to move him. Greatly troubled, but staunch as a rock, my old father stood, resting his lame foot on a heap of hides. I went to meet him. \"Phineas,\" said John, anxiously, \"come and help me. No, Abel Fletcher,\" he added, rather proudly, in reply to a sharp, suspicious glance at us both;...", "...and shouted. \"Hush--hush!\" cried the doctor, for the lad's voice jarred upon him in the silence. \"Distin's coming, sir,\" said Macey. There was an answering hail, and then the _pat-pat_ of steps, as Distin trotted after and joined them. By the time the church was reached, there was plenty of proof of Vane's popularity, for lanterns were dancing here and there, and lights could be seen coming from right up the street, while a loud eager buzz of voices reached their ears. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the doctor found himself surrounded by a band of about forty of the townsfolk, everyone of whom had some kind of lantern and a stick or pole, and all eager to go in search of the missing lad. Rounds the miller was one of the foremost, and carried the biggest lantern, and made the most noise. Chakes the sexton, was there, too, with his lantern--a dim, yellow-looking affair, whose sides were of horn sheets, with here and there fancy devices punched in the tin to supply...", "...but, after his hunger was satisfied, he turned to Jack and said: 'That is a very clever trick of yours. Give the table to me, and you shall have something still better.' 'I don't believe there _is_ anything better,' answered Jack. 'Yes, there is. Here is my bag; it will give you as many castles as you can possibly want.' Jack thought for a moment; then he replied: 'Very well, I will exchange with you.' And passing the table to the old man, he hung the bag over his arm. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later he summoned five hundred lancers out of the cornet and bade them go after the old man and fetch back the table. Now that by his cunning he had obtained possession of the three magic objects, he resolved to return to his native place. Smearing his face with dirt, and tearing his clothes so as to look like a beggar, he stopped the passers by and, on pretence of seeking money or food, he questioned them about the village gossip. In this manner he learned that his brothers...", "...third page, the hand in which she held the letter dropped to her side, and she turned her head slowly toward Leonard. In that position she stood--no tears moistening her eyes, no change passing over her features, no word escaping her lips, no movement varying the position of her limbs--in that position she stood, with the fatal letter crumpled up in her cold fingers, looking steadfastly, speechlessly, breathlessly at her blind husband. He was still sitting as she had seen him a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before, with his legs crossed, his hands clasped together in front of them, and his head turned expectantly in the direction in which he had last heard the sound of his wife's voice. But in a few moments the intense stillness in the room forced itself upon his attention. He changed his position--listened for a little, turning his head uneasily from side to side, and then called to his wife. \"Rosamond!\" At the sound of his voice her lips moved, and her fingers closed...", "...were the gods in whom they believed--I cannot say in whom they trusted? Gods who did the best their own poverty of being was capable of doing for men when they gave them the _illusion_ of hope. But I see they are waiting for us below. One thing I repeat--the waves that foamed across the spot where we now stand are gone away, have sunk and vanished.\" \"But they will come again, papa,\" faltered Wynnie. \"And God will come with them, my love,\" I said, as we lifted the litter. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more we were all seated on the sand around a table-cloth spread upon it. I shall never forgot the peace and the light outside and in, as far as I was concerned at least, and I hope the others too, that afternoon. The tide had turned, and the waves were creeping up over the level, soundless almost as thought; but it would be time to go home long before they had reached us. The sun was in the western half of the sky, and now and then a breath of wind came from the sea, with a...", "...buoyancy of spirit for running the race of the new day now ushering in. He withdraws a gunshot from the camp: and what does he descry in the grey dawn but, apparently, a small skiff with a single rower crossing the river towards them, but a short distance down the stream. The advancing light of day soon confirmed his hopes. He at once started in the direction of the skiff, having armed himself with his loaded musket, and resolved to get possession of it by fair means or by foul. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> brought him to the spot, and to his great astonishment he found himself in the undisputed possession of the object of his wishes, a tiny little canoe drawn up on the beach. In connection with the night's vision he would have positively declared that there was something supernatural in the affair, but having marked the bare footprints of its late occupant on the muddy soil, and heard the rustling of leaves in the distance, calling attention to the woolly head of its owner...", "...hard on the table; then, with a sudden burst, he exclaimed: \"It sounds like folly, and you may think that my troubles have driven me mad. But I have a feeling here--a feeling without any reason or proof to back it--that the woman now sleeping off her exhaustion in Anitra's room is the woman I courted and married--Georgian Hazen, now Georgian Ransom, my wife.\" \"Good! I have made no mistake. That is my thought, too,\" responded the lawyer. CHAPTER XV ANITRA A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later they were discussing this amazing possibility. \"I have no reason for this conclusion,--this hope,\" admitted Mr. Ransom. \"It is instinct with me, an intuition, and not the result of my judgment. It came to me when she first addressed me down by the mill-stream. If you consider me either wrong or misled, I confess that I shall not be able to combat your decision with any argument plausible enough to hold your attention for a moment.\" \"But I don't consider you either...", "...respect he owed to his visitors, and indeed to his wife, for she at least deserved the credit which is due to sincerity, even if mistaken. He shouted with laughter, saying did anyone ever hear such glorious Rot? A talking picture--only fancy! Why, you might as well put down anything you heard in your ears to any picture on the walls. One the same as another. Of course everyone knew that Euphemia was as full of fancies as an egg is full of meat. Just you leave her alone for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in a dark room, or a burying-ground, and see if she didn't see a ghost! \"That's _quite_ another thing,\" said Miss Volumnia and Mr. MacAnimus simultaneously. And Mr. Vacaw added, as pacific confirmation, \"Surely--surely! Ghosts belong to an entirely different category.\" A feeling that Ghosts could not be coped with so near lunch may have caused an impulse towards peroration. It was not, however, to fructify yet, for Mr. MacAnimus appealed for a moment's hearing. \"With...", "...children who with the qualities of service in their souls are treading dangerously near to the footsteps of the original scapegrace for lack of attention; that I have been led into this garrulous homily. It must not be supposed, either from what I have said that there was never any discipline in the Home of Adam and Eve. Later on there came to be a lot of it, and I am not sure that its excesses in later periods were not as evil in their influence as its utter lack at a time when ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with the hair-brush would have done Cain more good than ten years in the county jail. To the world at large these two boys are interesting because of the fact that they introduced humor into the world. Adam never had any, and Eve, as we have seen, was rather too busy to joke, but not so with the youngsters, who, doubtless from their constant association with the monkeys bubbled over with a kind of fun that though necessarily primitive, was quite appealing. It was Cain who...", "...a minute, and forgot the place I'd to go to, and come away to think in a quiet part.'...\" He stopped abruptly in his ravings. \"You give me the money, Rhoda!\" She handed him the money-bags. He seized them, and dashed them to the ground with the force of madness. Kneeling, he drew out his penknife, and slit the sides of the bags, and held them aloft, and let the gold pour out in torrents, insufferable to the sight; and uttering laughter that clamoured fierily in her ears for long <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards, the old man brandished the empty bags, and sprang out of the room. She sat dismayed in the centre of a heap of gold. CHAPTER XLI On the Monday evening, Master Gammon was at the station with the cart. Robert and Rhoda were a train later, but the old man seemed to be unaware of any delay, and mildly staring, received their apologies, and nodded. They asked him more than once whether all was well at the Farm; to which he replied that all was quite well,...", "...himself. He suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon inspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house. It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club--all the details of service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before ten. Everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight, the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired. Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste. Each pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the master's shoes. In short, the house in Saville Row, which must...", "...and a squeeze of lemon juice. Let it get cold and then mask the atelets (or skewers with the forcemeat, &c.) with it, and fry them quickly in butter. Fry a large oval crouton of bread, scoop out the centre and fill it with fried slices of cucumber and truffles boiled in a little Chablis. Stick the skewers into the crouton and pour the sauce round it. For a maigre dish use fillets of fish, truffles, mushrooms, and Bechamel sauce (No. 3).

Beyond there,\" nodding his head over east, \"is the Murray House that can tell its story. Handsome Mrs. Murray, and she was a Quaker, too, made herself so charming in her hospitality to the British generals that she detained them long enough for Silliman's brigade to retreat to Harlem. Washington was awaiting them at the Apthorpe House, and they had left that place not more than fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> when the British came flying in the hot haste of pursuit. So but for Mrs. Murray's smiles and friendliness they might have captured our Washington as well as the city.\" \"That was splendid,\" declared Charles enthusiastically. \"And maybe as a boy Lindley Murray might have thought up his grammar that he was to write later on to puzzle your brains,\" continued Dr. Joe. \"Well, that is odd, too. I'll forgive him his grammar,\" said Ben, with a twinkle in his eye. \"And if we...", "...until he is the image of the old man over again. \"Similarly,\" says Paul, \"live with Christ; learn to carry His image with you, learn to adore Him, learn to love Him, and infallibly, whether you will or not, by this simple method you will become, Christ over again; you will become conformed, as God means you to become conformed, to the image of His Son.\" This has been tested by the experience of thousands; and it has been found to be a true method. Every one who spends but two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the morning in the observation of Christ, every one who will be at the pains to let the image of Christ rise before him and to remember the purity, the unworldliness, the heavenliness, the godliness of Jesus Christ, that man is the better for this exercise. And how utterly useless is it to offer any other method of sanctification to thousands of our fellow-citizens. How can many of our fellow-citizens secrete themselves for prayer? If you ask them to go and pray as you pray...", "...syringe the wasps with nicotine soap, eight ounces to a gallon of hot or cold water. This plan kills quickly, but the fruit no longer attracts. Squibs a half-inch in diameter, three inches long, made of gunpowder moistened with water, one-fourth of flowers of sulphur added, mixed into a paste, wrapped in brown paper, and tied at one end, are good for the work. After dark, light the squib, push the lighted end into the hole, put a sod over, and ram it in to confine the fumes. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> dig up and destroy the grubs, then fill up the hole. If the nest is high up, attach the squib to a stick, light, and keep it close (while burning) to the entrance. Young gardeners enjoy this squibbing process.

The winter set in, and the crew managed to exist as men usually do under such circumstances. They built a hut and killed bears, living with no very great discomfort till the middle of October, when the ice pressed on the ship and stove it in. The water gained when the ice retreated; the _Hansa_ was doomed to destruction, and she sank, on the 21st, in latitude 70 degrees 52 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> North 21 degrees West near the Liverpool coast amid the floating ice. The crew escaped to the ice. They had already, Crusoe fashion, saved all they could from the ship. The field of ice in which they had encamped drifted away to the south. The floe was examined. It was about seven miles in circumference, about two miles in diameter, and about forty-five feet thick, five feet being above water. Christmas came, still they drifted. By the new year the ice gave symptoms of...", "...was out of the wrappers, and the room was a wilderness of brown paper. Everything had been packed into four canvas dunnage sacks, and now these were firmly strapped on the toboggan. The rifles and the snowshoes were similarly attached, so that the whole outfit was in one secure package. They hauled this down to the railway station themselves to make sure that there would be no delay, and dispatched it by express to Waverley, where they intended to leave the train. It was then a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after six.

We've got two hours, and now I guess I'll go home and have supper with my folks and say good-bye. We'll all meet at the depot.\" Neither Fred nor Macgregor had any relatives in the city and no necessary farewells to make. They had supper together at a downtown restaurant, and afterwards met Maurice at the Union Depot,...", "...did not even trouble to answer this speech.

On our approach most of the women decamped with their bags and nets containing their...", "...could be made out going down into the darkness, while a constant stream of exhausted air which escaped from the helmet-valve kept rising in great bubbles. The pump clanked as its pistons worked up and down, and the sailors and divers--the former eagerly and the latter in a sulky fashion--approached the side and looked over. Captain Studwick himself held the signal-line, and answered the calls made upon him for more or less air by communicating with the men at the pump; and so the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed, during which time, by the necessity for lengthening out the tube and cord, it was evident that Dutch was going over the submerged vessel in different directions.

The watch on her wrist gave her twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and a half in which to reach Bruton Street. Lady Congreve expected her at five. The gilt clock at Verrey's was striking five. Florinda looked at it with a dull expression, like an animal.

There was no risk, he was sure, of being discovered, and it would be very ungrateful to the Turgots to go away without trying to see them again. He wished that Jack could have gone also, but he agreed that it was better for him to remain to do a few more things to the raft. Before he started they arranged the tackles for launching it; and they believed that, when once in the water, it would not take them more than ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or a quarter of an hour to haul the empty casks under the bottom and to step and set up the mast. They might then, should the wind be favourable, stand boldly out to sea. This being settled, Bill lowered himself down on the sand by a rope, and ran off as fast as he could go. Jack quickly finished the work he had undertaken; then putting his hand into his pocket, he felt the gold pieces. \"It's a pity we shouldn't have more of these,\" he said to himself. \"I don't agree...", "...Discoveries such as this are made at their appointed time, and Kopisch may perhaps have had precursors.

No wise man goes to the Blue Grotto from the steamer by which he travels from Naples or Sorrento. When one has crossed the ocean, and journeyed thousands of miles, to see a sight so wonderful, why should one be content to hurry round it in the few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> given by a boatman eager for other fares? There is but one way to see the Blue Grotto, and that is by hiring a boat at the Marina on a still, sunny morning, bargaining carefully that there shall be no compulsion to leave before one wishes.

So it was in my case. It was the first foreign missionary meeting of the new fiscal year, one day in March. We met at Sister MacL's house. The jonquils were in bloom, the world was fair, and out in the orchards we could see the peach trees one mass of pink blossoms. I never felt more religious or thankful in my life, there in the little green parlor listening to the opening hymn. The roll was called, showing that we had an unusually full meeting. The <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> were read, then came a discussion concerning dues for the coming year. All this time Sister Shaller had been presiding with her usual dignity. She was a beautiful woman, childless, and much praised for her interest in church works. She was rich and enjoyed the peculiar distinction of wearing very fashionable gowns even to church. Upon this occasion something reserved, potential and authoritative in her manner made me nervous. I had a premonition that she was after...", "...old thing! the hot water had taken the fur off his back. Then came another cat, limping up to the witness stand, whose leg had been broken by a stone which Hal had thrown. There were so many witnesses that it would make my story too long to tell about them all. All that Christopher Gray could say in Hal's favor was: \"He has a good mother.\" \"The more shame for him,\" said one of the lawyers. When the jury had heard all that was to be said, they went out of the room together; in five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they came back; all agreed that Hal should be punished.

Before breaking up in June, Porson's played their first cricket match with a strong village team, and beat them handsomely, although, as the boys said, it was to their master's bowling that their success was due.

The order was obeyed, and all listened intently. Presently there was a general exclamation as the sound of footsteps was heard ahead. \"That is a marine pacing up and down on sentry.

He sat on silent for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> when his friend had left him, gradually recovering balance. He knew his own peril well enough, but he was not yet certain enough of his own standpoint--and perhaps not courageous enough--to risk all by declaring it.

Then Ogier was carried up, and passed with head, then shoulders through the orifice in the vault. It seemed to Jean as though half an hour elapsed before the ropes descended again. When he saw them fall, then he eagerly blew out the candle, and committed himself to the cords. In three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he was above ground. He saw his father standing in the doorway, looking out over the terrace at the clear evening sky, drawing in long breaths of the sweet pure air of evening into his lungs.

Alarmed for her husband, she rushed to his tent--to find him already awakened by the noise, and issuing from its entrance, his drawn sword in his hand. The wind, which had a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before but curled the triumphant banners, now circulated the destroying flame.

Shifting skies are never certain signs, though they normally indicate an unsettled condition of the atmosphere. I have observed them after a blizzard, too. I looked back over my shoulder, just when I emerged from the bush into the open fields. And there I became aware of a new element again. A quiet and yet very distinct commotion arose from the south. These cloth-clouds lifted, and a nearly impalpable change crept over the whole of the sky. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later it crystallised into a distinct impression. A dark grey, faintly luminous, inverted bowl stood overhead. Not a star was to be seen above, nor yet the moon. But all around the horizon there was a nearly clear ring, suffused with the light of the moon. There, where the sky is most apt to be dark and hazy, stars peeped out--singly and dimly only--I did not recognize any constellation. And then the grey bowl seemed to contract into patches.

How she suffered when she looked in her lover's face and listened to his voice, knowing it was for the last time! She did not even hear the name of his friends, when they were introduced to her. She sat wondering whether any one living had ever gone through such torture before--wondering why it did not kill her; and then it seemed to her but two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before dinner was over.

Come along and I'll introduce you to the others.\" It was a very cheerful party who, after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> under the trees, strolled into luncheon and took their places at the round table reserved for them at the end of the room. Maggie at once took possession of Chalmers. \"I have been so anxious to meet you, Mr. Chalmers,\" she said. \"They tell me that you represent the modern methods in American diplomacy, and that therefore you have been made first secretary over the heads of half a dozen of your seniors.

They hail from Manchester and the Clyde, and the great...", "...already seeped into the tracks I estimated the two of them had stood there within thirty minutes. My pursuit became more cautious. Not more than twenty rods from the spring I came to a trail swinging in from the east, as shown by a broken vine and a bent bush. The newcomer had moved carelessly and had fallen in behind the two Indians. I stuck to the trail until the diminished sunlight warned me it would soon be too dark to continue. Then I caught a whiff of burning wood and in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I was reconnoitering a tiny glade. My first glance took in a small fire; my second glance dwelt upon a scene that sent me into the open on the jump. An Indian sat at the foot of a walnut-tree, his legs crossed and his empty hands hanging over his knees. At one side crouched a squaw, her long hair falling on each side of her face and hiding her profile. In a direct line between me and the warrior stood Shelby Cousin, his rifle bearing on the warrior. My step caused him to...", "...himself an officer of the Government he had denounced so fiercely, being appointed pilot at Port Albert by Sir George Gipps, who graciously allowed him to continue the receipt of the fee already charged, viz., three pounds for each vessel inwards and outwards.

After making a formal demand for the money, and giving the trespassers ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to take their goods away, Mr. Tyers ordered his men to set the buildings on fire, and in a short time they were reduced to ashes. The commissioner then rode back to his camp with the eighty pounds, and wrote a report to the Government of the successful inauguration of law and order within his jurisdiction, and of the energetic manner in which he had commenced to put down the irregularities prevalent in Gippsland. The next duty undertaken by the commissioner was to settle...", "...and if mamma will let us go,--and s'pose--maybe--Uncle Ruthven in the--rocks--and I'm--not--going\"-- \"Maggie,\" said Uncle Ruthven, the next morning, \"I rather think I missed the company of those constant thoughts you promised me last night, at least for part of the time.\" Maggie climbed on her uncle's knee, put her arms about his neck and her lips very close to his ear, and whispered,-- \"_Please_ don't tell any one, Uncle Ruthven; but I am afraid I did go to sleep for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> last night.

Five minutes of fierce gale, with lightning that momentarily dispelled the night, then a pause--the herald of coming rain. A few great ice-cold drops smote like hail on the tarpaulin shelter that served headquarters for a mess-tent. Then followed five minutes of a deluge such as you in England cannot conceive. A deluge against which the stoutest oil-skin is as blotting-paper. A rain which seems also to entice fountains from the earth beneath you. In ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> all is over. The stars are again demurely winking above you, and all that you know of the storm is that you see the vast diminishing cloud, revealed in the west by the fading lightning-flashes, and that you have not a dry possession either in your kit or on your person. \"Not much fear of sleeping sentries to-night,\" said the chief of the staff as we cowered round a fire under the waggon-sail. \"No; and it is just as well: it is on these sleepless nights that 'brother'[16]...", "...for breath--purred softer and softer and--slept at last. It was noon. The silence now was almost as painful to Shiloh as the noise had been. The sudden stopping of shuttle and wheel and belt and beam did not stop the noise in her head. It throbbed and buzzed there in an echoing ache, as if all the previous sounds had been fire-waves and these the scorched furrows of its touch. Wherever she turned, the echo of the morning's misery sounded in her ears. And now they had forty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> for noon recess. They sat in a circle, these five children--and ate their lunch of cold soda biscuits and fat bacon. Not a word did they say--not a laugh nor a sound to show they were children,--not even a sigh to show they were human. Silently, like wooden things they choked it down and then--O men and women who love your own little ones--look! Huddled together on the great, greasy, dirty floor of this mill, in all the attitudes of tired-out, exhausted childhood, they...", "...contradiction!--she had now put herself in his way. He dropped a few tentative words that seemed to express regret for the past, and when he remarked that she listened eagerly, and waited for more, he knew that he was on safe and profitable ground. Safe, and how easy to walk on! At a moment's notice he had accepted this new, apparently unsuitable part, and its strange passion at once grew familiar to him, and could be expressed easily. Perhaps he even deceived himself, for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or for half an hour while the process of deceiving another lasted, that he had actually felt as he said--that his changed manner of life had resulted from this feeling. \"If I have not known remorse,\" he said, \"I pity the poor fellows who do.\" And much more he said, speaking not fluently, but brokenly, with intervals of silence, as if something that had long remained hidden had at last been wrung from him.

For a moment he leaned back against the balcony, absorbed in deep thought. \"Twenty-three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> left,\" he said to himself, consulting his watch again. \"I must go at once; they will need me.\" She took the telegram from his hand. \"Oh, Henry, I am so sorry,--and the boat, too, you counted upon. Oh, how much trouble you have had over this work! I wish you had never touched it!\" she exclaimed, with the momentary weakness of the woman. \"But look! read it again.\" Her voice rose with a new hope in it. \"Do you see? Captain Joe signs it,--he's not hurt!\" Sanford patted her...", "...I thought, as if he had had a hard morning chandling the corn, were beginning to doze lightly when things suddenly brisked up, bringing Gussie into the picture for the first time. \"Today,\" said the bearded bloke, \"we are all happy to welcome as the guest of the afternoon Mr. Fitz-Wattle----\" At the beginning of the address, Gussie had subsided into a sort of daydream, with his mouth hanging open. About half-way through, faint signs of life had begun to show. And for the last few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he had been trying to cross one leg over the other and failing and having another shot and failing again. But only now did he exhibit any real animation. He sat up with a jerk. \"Fink-Nottle,\" he said, opening his eyes. \"Fitz-Nottle.\" \"Fink-Nottle.\" \"I should say Fink-Nottle.\" \"Of course you should, you silly ass,\" said Gussie genially. \"All right, get on with it.\" And closing his eyes, he began trying to cross his legs again.

He had thought of everything. The wounded man was lifted carefully and placed upon the mattress. A long and difficult operation which, in spite of extreme caution, drew many terrible groans from the baron. When all was ready, each officer took an end of the litter, and the little procession, headed by the abbe, started on its way. They were obliged to proceed slowly on account of the suffering which...", "...I looked sheepish. I was convinced that it was merely a passing mood [note: shadchen]: Marriage broker, match-maker CHAPTER XVIII NEXT Monday, when I was ready to go to my place of business, Dora left the house, pitcher in hand, before I rose from the breakfast-table. She was going for milk, but a side-glance which she cast at the floor in my direction as she turned to shut the door behind her told me that she wanted to see me in the street. After letting some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> pass I put on my overcoat and hat, bade Max a studiously casual good-by, and departed I awaited her on the stoop.

Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and bring him over.... He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:-- \"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.\" It was so funny to hear my wife called \"Madam Mina\" by this kindly, strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:-- \"I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already.\"...", "...the automobile shot under the impulsion of the gas. Minutes, golden minutes, had been wasted in taking up the pursuit because of his going to Martinez' office and because of the flat tire. Sorenson now would be miles away with his prisoner. Sweeping out of town with the car's headlights illuminating the road, Steele Weir blessed the drizzling mist that dampened the dust so as to leave a tire's imprint. Almost at once he picked up the track, for not more than twenty or twenty-five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had elapsed since Sorenson's flight and not even a horseman had since been over the way. Though he knew it not, the interval of time had been reduced by the stop made by the first machine, a mile or so out of town, when the abductor removed the blanket from Janet Hosmer's head to announce his evil scheme. From the main road leading to Bowenville Weir saw the car's trail turn aside into a mesa track pointing obliquely for Terry Creek canyon; and he suspected that Sorenson was...", "...These cuts of meat are the most nutritious ones and by long, slow cooking can be made as acceptable as the more expensive cuts of meat; they are best boiled or braised. In order to shut in the juices the meat should at first be subjected to a high degree of heat for a short time. A crust or case will then be formed on the outside, after which the heat should be lowered and the cooking proceed slowly. This rule holds good for baking, where the oven must be very hot for the first few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> only; for boiling, where the water must be boiling and covered for a time, and then placed where it will simmer only; for broiling, where the meat must be placed close to the red-hot coals or under the broiler flame of the gas stove at first, then held farther away.

The gunboat was completing its turning movement--slowly--ah, how slowly! And yet? How could the felucca, with no more than a fresh breeze to rely on, hope to evade that greyhound of the seas? A spout of gray smoke burst from the gray painted sides; the sound of a cannon shot echoed down to them among the crags. Muhammed laughed. \"Blank cartridge,\" he said derisively. \"Within five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> their faces will be as blank. Sons of dirt, I spit upon you!\" The girl's apprehension grew. Confidence rang in the Moor's voice. He smiled as one who had already triumphed. And still the felucca drove shorewards, relentlessly towards the bare face of stone. But the torpedo boat was gaining speed.

As Fitz smuggled the weapon into my hand, I could feel my pulses leaping...", "...society of her old husband. Any change, she thought, must be for the better. She was bustling about, setting her table while the supper was cooking over the fire, when the outer door opened, and a man's step--not that of her husband, yet strangely familiar--crossed the threshold. She turned to see whose it was, then uttered a low cry full of terror, while her cheek blanched and the dish in her hand fell to the floor with a crash and lay in fragments at her feet.

That little human tadpole, which the old toad of a father would not suffer to stay ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in his house, proved as welcome at the nunnery of St. Sebastian as she was odious elsewhere. The superior of the convent was aunt, by the mother's side, to the new-born stranger. She, therefore, kissed and blessed the little lady.

The superior thanked the hidalgo for his very splendid present. The nuns thanked him each and all;...", "...my lady.\" But the twinkle returned. \"Oh, yes, of course. I spoilt your holiday, didn't I? By the way, does your mother know that you're in society now?\" And Lola replied, \"The bath is ready, my lady.\" And once more Feo laughed, lit a cigarette and went towards the bathroom.

From the moment that these came within the range of vision the driver beat the horse with the handle of his whip, a prelude, as we discovered, to the fact that a minor gate, obviously and invitingly leading to the yard, lolled open on...", "...that was a beautiful bit of boat-handling--a superb piece of seamanship!\" muttered one of the surgeons, admiringly. Powell Seaton, however, stopped to hear none of this. He gripped Tom by the arm, demanding hoarsely: \"You brought Clodis ashore? How is he? Where?\" \"Still unconscious, sir, and the ship's doctor offered no hope. You will find your friend in the port stateroom, sir.\" Signing to the surgeons to accompany him, Mr. Seaton vanished aft, the medical men with him.

Time could no longer be measured by any set of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or hours. There was only darkness, the howling winds, and the salty rain which must be in part the breath of the sea driven in upon them. The comforting fire vanished, chill and dankness crept up to cramp their bodies, so that now and again they were forced to their feet, to swing arms, stamp, drive the blood into faster circulation. Later came a time when the wind died, no longer driving the rain bullet-hard against and through their flimsy shelter. Then they slept in the...", "...he said. As he spoke the door opened and the curate entered, his dark, handsome face lined and careworn. It was obvious that he had suffered. He bowed, and then looked about him, without any suggestion of embarrassment. Malcolm Sage rose and held out his hand; Freynes followed suit. \"Ask Miss Muriel to come here,\" said the vicar to the maid as she was closing the door. The curate took the seat that Malcolm Sage indicated beside him. Silently the six men waited. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later Miss Crayne entered, pale but self-possessed. She closed the door behind her. Suddenly she caught sight of the curate. Her eyes widened, and her paleness seemed to become accentuated. A moment later it was followed by a crimson flush.

Once an American gave me a hint: \"I'm going to apply for a job as attendant in a natural-history museum.\" Only a few minutes before, these men had been taking part in aerial battles, attacking infantry in trenches, or enemy transport on roads fifteen or twenty kilometres away. And while they were talking of these things the drone of motors overhead announced the departure of other patrols to battle-lines which were only five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> distant by the route of the air. For when weather permitted there was an interlapping series of patrols flying over the sector from daylight till dark. The number of these, and the number of _avions_ in each patrol, varied as circumstances demanded. On one wall of the bureau hung a large-scale map of the sector, which we examined square by square with that delight which only the study of maps can give.

It would be a useless attempt to describe the horrors of that short but fearful period: all that could be gathered from the statements of the survivors was, that she twice touched the ground lightly, forward, at which time all her people were assembled on the deck; and presently one mountain wave hurled her broadside on the beach with such stupendous force, that the huge hull at once parted into a thousand fragments!...", "...Then I looked back to see the bullock drivers disgustedly resume the work they had again suspended. By this time the cattle had crossed a cane-grass swamp, and were out of sight; but before I had gone a quarter of a mile I saw Pup coming to meet me, limping and crestfallen. He had probably been kicked by one of the absconders; and as he could see no sign of civilisation except our camp, his sagacity had drawn him back. Well pleased, therefore, I returned to the wagons after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> absence. \"The cattle are out of sight, Steve,\" said I, as I rounded up the scattering bullocks. \"Not worth while to go after them now.\" \"Let them go, by all means,\" replied Thompson, with a ghastly simulation of cheerfulness. \"We'll gladly stand the loss of them, and make the station a present of Bum's mare besides, if we once get out of sight of this infernal camp--Stand up, Magpie--Just let us yoke up as quickly as if our lives depended on it--which, to tell the truth,...", "...the noise of the horses and the vehicle.

Annie's severest tussle was with the wire-haired terrier of the _Monsoon_, a plebeian but very conceited dog, who treated all vessels but his own with lordly contempt. She was ably assisted in the struggle by her willing allies, and for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the battle raged furiously, to the accompaniment of barks, growls, squeals, shrill yelps, and much snorting from the fighters. But before much damage had been done on either side the engagement was brought to a sudden and wholly unexpected termination by both the principal combatants falling overboard in their excitement.

Some persons assured me that they saw the shadow of the Moon flying rapidly over the landscape. My attention was otherwise occupied, and I was unable to verify this interesting observation. The shadow of the Moon in effect took only eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> (3.47 P.M. to 3.58 P.M.) to traverse the Iberian Peninsula from Porto to Alicante, _i.e._, a distance of 766 kilometers (475 miles). It must therefore have passed over the ground at a velocity of sixty-nine kilometers per minute, or 1,150 meters per second, a speed higher than that of a bullet. It can easily be watched from afar, on the mountains. Some weeks previous to this fine eclipse, when I informed the Spaniards of the belt along which it could be observed, I had...", "...through a tangled growth of blackthorn and brambles, crosses the stream dry-footed with a leap, and, creeping through the fence that bounds his stronghold, peers into the meadow beyond.

The Spencer and Hannibal passed under our lee, nearly becalmed, and anchored without the Caesar, firing, as the smoke subsided, through the openings between our ships at the enemy.

The suggestion was a good one, for thus many valuable <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> might be saved to us, and, throwing every ounce of my earthly muscles into the effort, I cleared the remaining distance between myself and the cliffs in great leaps and bounds that put me at their base in a moment.

Presently he rose, went to a little cabinet at the end of the room, and took from it a small magnifying glass, with whose aid he made a further study of the two documents; after which he resumed his eyeglasses and turned to Anstice with a smile. \"Your little problem is quite simple, Dr. Anstice,\" he said amiably....", "...and 1 pint of milk together and pour on potatoes boiling hot. Stir it well, strain and serve. =Asparagus (white) Soup.= Cut off the hard, green stems from two bunches of asparagus and put them in 2 quarts and a pint of water, with 2 pounds of veal (the knuckle is the best). Boil in a closely covered pot three hours, till the meat is in rags and the asparagus dissolved. Strain the liquor and return to the pot with the remaining half of the asparagus heads. Let this boil for twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more and add, before taking up, 2/3 of a teacup of sweet cream, in which has been stirred a dessertspoonful of corn starch.

I happened to see you walking in that direction, so I thought I would wait for you.\" With the manner of a man exercising a right he turned to walk back with her. A flame of irritation scorched her, but she did not show any emotion. She only said quietly: \"You know I am not particularly fond of being seen with men in the Grande Rue.\" \"Very well. If you like, I'll come to your flat by a round-about way. I'll be there five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after you are.\" Before she had time to say anything he was gone, striding through the crowd. Mrs. Clarke walked on and came into the Grande Rue. She lived in a flat in a street which turned out of the Grande Rue on the left not very far from the Taxim Garden. As she walked on slowly she was trying to make up her mind to force a break with Dion. She had great courage and was naturally ruthless, yet for once she was beset by indecision. She did not any longer feel sure...", "...at first they belonged to the band of robbers, who employed them to follow travellers, we hastily seized our arms, and prepared for a fight; but Gabriel asserting the dogs were a particular breed belonging to the Cherokees, Choctaws, Creeks, and other tribes of half-civilized Indians, established upon the Red River, we began shouting and firing our rifles, so as to guide towards us the Indians, who, we presumed, could not be far behind their dogs. We did not wait long, for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards a gallant band of eighty Cherokees dashed through the cover, and reined up their horses before us. All was explained in a moment. A system of general depredation had been carried on, for a long while with impunity, upon the plantations above the great bend of the Red River. The people of Arkansas accused the Texans, who, in their turn, asserted that the parties were Indians. Governor Yell, of the Arkansas, complained to Ross, the highly talented chief of the...", "...a dainty salad with the ice chest which must have been thrown away without it. Thus the expense, not only of the ice, but also of the chest, is soon saved, to say nothing of the pleasure and enjoyment of the said salad, which one would so infinitely rather have had than the chops and steaks so universally served. Delicious little breakfast dishes can be concocted over night from the remains of fish and meat served at tea and put down into the ice all night. These are cooked in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the morning, and form such a pleasant change to the standing dish of eggs and bacon; and how proud a good house-keeper will feel when her little dishes are enjoyed, and she knows that they have cost nothing!--for the food would not have kept, and must therefore have been thrown away if she had not possessed an ice chest. This is only one instance of what may be accomplished, but in the daily routine of work many more will be found. Think, for a moment, of the state of the...", "...kneeled with grace. He got up, drenched and half-blinded with the turbid water, and, taking Grace in his arms, waded waist-high to his bed, and laid her down on it. It was a moment of despair. Death had entered that chamber in a new, unforeseen, and inevitable form. The ceiling was low, the water was rising steadily; the bedstead floated; his chest of drawers floated, though his rifle and pistols lay on it, and the top drawers were full of the tools he always had about him: in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the rising water must inevitably jam Grace and him against the ceiling, and drown them like rats in a hole. Fearful as the situation was, a sickening horror was added to it by the horrible smell of the water; it had a foul and appalling odor, a compound of earthiness and putrescence; it smelt like a newly-opened grave; it paralyzed like a serpent's breath. Stout as young Little's heart was, it fainted now when he saw his bedstead, and his drawers, and his chairs, all...", "...and I observed that the dough did not rise. It was in a singular shape; and it remained heavy all the time. At about three o'clock we sat down to dinner, and there were six dumplings brought to table. I observed to Sarah Peer that they were black and heavy instead of their being white and light. My husband, Robert Gregson Turner, and his father, Orlibar Turner, sat down to dinner with me: I helped them to some dumplings, and took a small piece myself. I found myself affected in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after I had eaten it. I did not eat a quarter of a dumpling. I felt myself very faint--an excruciating pain, which increased every minute: it came so bad that I was obliged to leave the table--I went up stairs. I ate, beside the dumpling, a piece of rump-steak cooked by Eliza. When I was up stairs I perceived my sickness increased, and I observed my head was swollen extremely. I retched very violently: I was half an hour alone, and wondered they did not come to my assistance. I...", "...in sudden anger to her feet. \"Oh, father, don't hit me--oh, please don't--I'll tell--I'll tell! I got eighteenpence,\" cried the girl, shrinking back terrified. He turned and went back to his seat, grinning at his success in getting at the truth. Presently he asked his wife if she had spent eighteenpence in bread. \"No, I didn't. I got a haddock for morning, and two ounces of tea, and a loaf, and a bundle of wood,\" she returned sullenly. After an interval of a couple of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he got up, went to the cupboard, and opened it. \"There's the haddy right enough,\" he said. \"No great things--cost you thrippence, I s'pose. Tea tuppence-ha'penny, and that's fivepence-ha'penny, and a ha'penny for wood, and tuppence-ha'penny for a loaf makes eightpence-ha'penny. There's more'n ninepence over, Margy, and all I want is a pint of beer and a screw. Threepence--come now.\" \"I've nothing to give you,\" she returned doggedly. \"Then what did you do with it? How...", "...angrily, as his companions thus discussed the preliminaries. Then came a long time of silence broken by the footsteps of the party, or the loud breathing of those who were carrying the burden. Several times Fred tried to give an alarm; but his mouth was held so firmly that not a sound could escape his lips, and after a while he contented himself with simply trying to form some idea of the direction in which he was being taken. When the party had carried him for ten or fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a halt was made, and then his captors took the precaution of enveloping his head in a coat, which shut out every sound, save the loudly uttered remarks of the regulators. He heard Skip berating one of the party, because some reference was made to their destination, and then ensued a noisy discussion as to what should be done with him. \"If he don't turn up to-morrer mornin' old Donovan will swear we took him off, an' there'll be a heap of trouble for all hands,\" one of the...", "...usual, a look rather complacent than disapproving.

When she rose the next morning the bell was clanging for the second breakfast, and people were pouring in from the beach in every variety of attire. Paula, whom a restless night had left with a headache, which, however, she said nothing about, was reluctant to emerge from the seclusion of her chamber, till her aunt, discovering what was the matter with her, suggested that a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the open air would refresh her; and they went downstairs into the hotel gardens. The clatter of the big breakfast within was audible from this spot, and the noise seemed suddenly to inspirit Paula, who proposed to enter. Her aunt assented. In the verandah under which they passed was a rustic hat-stand in the form of a tree, upon which hats and other body-gear hung like bunches of fruit. Paula's eye fell upon a felt hat to which a small block-book was attached by a string....", "...and with sharply marked features; his remarkably long hair hung wildly round his head, with two eagle plumes thrust into the topknot, while his neck was decorated with a necklace of bears' claws, and his arms with brass rings. The lower part of his face and the eyelids ruddled with vermilion, and his forehead and cheeks painted black, gave him a terrific, uncomfortable aspect, which was heightened by the dazzlingly white teeth visible between his drawn-back lips. I only gazed for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at the corpse, took his bow and quiver of arrows, hung them on my horse and speedily beat a retreat, as the comrades of the dead man were certainly not far off, and might very easily be on the road to the spot, guided by my shots. I rode back on my trail and soon reached camp, when I told my friends what had happened. Tiger was out hunting and not yet returned. I ordered a rapid start, had the horses packed and everything ready to be off. We had scarce completed our...", "...this about? Where are you?\" \"At my house, above the iron curtain, in the ceiling of my study.\" \"In the ceiling!\" repeated the Prefect, not knowing what to think. \"Yes; and more or less done for, I confess.\" \"We'll send and help you out,\" said M. Desmalions, who was beginning to enjoy himself. \"Later on, Monsieur le Prefet. First answer me. Quickly! If not, I don't know that I shall have the strength. What's the time?\" \"Oh, look here!\" \"I beg of you--\" \"It's twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to three.\" \"Twenty minutes to three!\" It was as though Don Luis found renewed strength in a sudden fit of fear. His weak voice recovered its emphasis, and, by turns imperious, despairing, and beseeching, full of a conviction which he did his utmost to impart to M. Desmalions, he said: \"Go away, Monsieur le Prefet! Go, all of you; leave the house. The house will be blown up at three o'clock. Yes, yes, I swear it will. Ten days after the fourth letter means now, because...", "...to some extent,\" answered Geoffrey. \"But why do you ask me?\" \"It's quite simple,\" said Mrs. Savine, smiling. \"Did my husband tell you that when we were in England, we were held up by a storm there one night in your ancestral home? There was a man there who ought to belong to the feudal ages. He was called Musker, and he told us quaint stories about some of you. I fancy Geoffrey, who robbed the king's dragoons, must have looked just like you when you shut your fingers so, a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago.\" \"I am a little surprised,\" Geoffrey returned with a flush rising in his cheeks. \"Musker used to talk a great deal of romantic nonsense. Crosbie Ghyll is no longer mine.

In the evening the patient complaining of pain in the bowels, a sitz-bath of 70 deg. for twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> was administered, and an injection after it, which relieved her. The rest of the time, one pack and bath in the morning, and a bath in the afternoon were deemed sufficient. On the eighteenth day of my treatment the patient left the house for the first time, and continued improving from day to day, the packs being continued for about two weeks longer on account of the broken gland, which continued to discharge. I tried to persuade the parents to continue the packs till the...", "...of these dogs will draw a weight of 120 lb. over the snow, at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour. [It is extraordinary to consider the powers and wonderful speed of these animals, almost equalling that of many horses. Captain Lyon informs us that three dogs drew a sledge weighing 100 lbs. and himself, one mile in six minutes; his leader dog, which is generally more powerful than the others, drew 196 lb. the same distance in eight minutes; seven dogs ran one mile in four <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and thirty seconds, with a heavy sledge full of men attached to them; ten dogs ran one mile in five minutes; nine dogs drew 1611 lb. the same distance in nine minutes.--'Lyon's Journal', p. 243.--L.] In summer, many of these dogs are used as beasts of burden, and each carries from thirty to fifty pounds. They are then much better kept than in the winter; for they have the remains of the whale and sea-calf, which their masters disdain to eat.

Outside the gate there was a general shaking of hands; the director, whom we had seen every day at a distance, was the first to greet us, and Mr. Baguet, the brother of the Spanish consul, who was waiting to receive me, welcomed me to Russia. With sincere regret I bade good-by to my old soldier, mounted a drosky, and in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> was deposited in a hotel, in size and appearance equal to the best in Paris. It was a pleasure once more to get into a wheel-carriage; I had not seen one since I left Italy, except the old hack I mentioned at Argos, and the arabas at Constantinople. It was a pleasure, too, to see hats, coats, and pantaloons. Early associations will cling to a man; and, in spite of a transient admiration for the dashing costume of the Greek and Turk, I warmed to the ungraceful covering of...", "...small piece of charcoal laid on top of the stock will prevent it turning sour in the hot weather. With this basin of stock to work on, many dainty tit-bits are possible which could not be made without it. How often has the cookery book been searched for \"something nice\" and laid down with a sigh when half a pint of gravy has been found necessary to concoct the desired dainty! But with a basin of stock on hand, all these things are procurable, and it certainly does not take more than ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to break up the bones, skim the pot, and strain it, and last of all it costs nothing. In cases of sudden emergency, when stock is wanted and is not to be had, the recipe for Quick Beef Tea answers very well, using one quart of water instead of one pint, and by adding a few vegetables; this is made in five minutes.

Arriving at the place where he meant to ford the river and begin his drive, Mr. Masterson halted for a cloud of unusual size and thickness to blanket the blurred radiance of the dwindling moon. Such a cloud was on its way; from where it hung curtain-wise on the horizon it should take ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before its eclipse of the interfering moon began. While he waited Mr. Masterson removed his sombrero and fastened it back of the cantle by a saddle-string. Also, he unstrapped his blanket and wrapped it about his shoulders, for it was part of Mr. Masterson's strategy to play the Cheyenne for this raid. It was among the chances that he would run across an Indian herder or meet with some belated savage coming into camp. The latter was not likely, however, since the last journey...", "...are Mr. Flixton's quarters?\" he asked at last. He might possibly learn something from him. The man told him, and Sir Robert summoned his servants and went out. It was dark by this time, but a faint glare shone overhead and there was a murmur in the air, as if, in the gloom beneath, the heart of the city was palpitating, in dread of it knew not what. Sir Robert had not far to go. He had barely passed into College Green when he met Flixton under a lamp. And so it happened that two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, Vaughan, on his way from Brereton's lodgings in Unity Street, came plump upon the two. He might have gone by in ignorance, but as he passed the taller man looked up, and Vaughan with a shock of surprise recognised Sir Robert Vermuyden. Flixton caught sight of Vaughan at the same moment, and \"Here's your man, Sir Robert,\" he cried with a little malice in his tone. \"Here, Vaughan,\" he continued, \"Here's Sir Robert Vermuyden! He's looking for you. He wants to...", "...said Risley. \"When shall we start?\" \"To-night,\" said Jack, and, being near the station, they turned in to look up the time of the fast express. Jack glanced along the platform, and soon found what he sought, one of Cook's interpreters. \"I want to ask some questions of the booking-clerk,\" he said to the man, slipping several _lire_ into his hand, \"you might come and interpret for me.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said the man at once, and followed the tall young Englishman to the office. In three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Jack had learned what he wished as to the shortest route and fastest trains; then he and Risley set out to return to the hotel. Suddenly Jack remembered another point, and crying, \"Half-a-minute, Buck,\" he rushed back to the office. He thrust open a swing door and saw that the interpreter was still there, and was now in conversation with a smaller man. Jack stepped forward, and the smaller man looked up and gave a short, quick cry of alarm. For a second Jack stood with...", "...and unprincipled man. As long as Mark had the diamond pin in his possession, the vicinity of such a fellow meant peril. He decided that he had better lose no time in delivering the pin to Mrs. Loring. He had told Florence that he would call the next day, but really there was no reason why he should not deliver it at once. About three o'clock he called a cab and directed the driver to drive to No. 10011/2 Euclid Avenue. The distance was somewhat more than a mile, and in fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he found himself at his destination. \"Shall I wait for you?\" asked the hackman. \"No; I may be in the house some time.\" He paid for the cab and rang the doorbell. \"Is Mrs. Loring at home?\" asked Mark of the servant who answered the bell. \"Yes, sir, but I don't know if she will see you.\" \"Tell her that I come from Mr. Swan of New York.\" \"She will see you,\" said the servant returning after a short absence.

The little doctor of Vassili-Ostrow had already gone, saying there was nothing more for him to do when two such celebrated specialists had arrived. However, in spite of their celebrity, no one had ever heard the names they gave. Koupriane believed the little doctor was an accomplice. The most necessary thing was to warn those in the room above. There was immediate danger that someone would come downstairs to find the doctors and...", "...me that gun!\" she said. There was a titter and in a moment it had spread until it became a roar of laughter. Raymond the blusterer, wholly unnerved by the sudden appearance of his small wife, surrendered at once, and without conditions. \"Be off, the rest of you!\" she said. \"I daresay the young gentleman is quite right! As if you could fight against the Germans here!\" Raymond's wife had given the rest a cue. In a few moments the barricade was being dismantled. In five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> peace reigned. And Raymond, entirely subdued now, came to Paul. \"Need we give up our arms?\" he asked. \"You know what the Germans order,\" said Paul. \"Perhaps they have no right to do so, but they have the strength to enforce their orders, and that is what counts, after all.

He advanced in the centre of the circle without appearing in the least intimidated, fixing his eyes on each of the monks in turn, and waiting until one of these twelve granite statues should break silence. The president was the first to speak to him. \"From whom do you come?\" he asked him. \"He who sent me,\" replied the peasant, \"ordered me to...", "...\"I'll get one.\" The B after Jones was erased, leaving a dark splotch. I wrote B. before Jones. \"We must get that dark spot out,\" said he. He took the book and very carefully tore out part of the leaf, so that there remained only B. Jones and the part of the fly-leaf above the writing. \"Now,\" said he, \"put that in your pocket.\" \"What is all this for, Doctor?\" \"For a purpose. Keep it in your pocket; it may serve to protect you.\" \"What time is it, Doctor?\" \"Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to eleven.\" \"I must go.\" He said no word; but he put up his hands to my face, and made me bend to him, and kissed me. * * * * * Before midnight one of General Morell's orderlies had passed me through our cavalry pickets beyond Mechanicsville.

It gave him excruciating pain, but he was too much of a man to mind that. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he was lying at full length on the sledge. \"Now, Tumbler and Pussi,\" said Nunaga, \"cover him well up with skins, while I go and fetch Kabelaw, but _don't touch his leg_.\" She found that Kabelaw could walk slowly, with support, and after much exertion succeeded in getting her also laid out upon the sledge alongside of the wizard. Then Nunaga tied them both firmly down with long walrus-lines. She also attached the children to the sledge with lines round their waists, to...", "...the Australians advanced half a mile. The R.C.

But, aside from that, there was no sound or sign between them until, hardly an hour and a half after leaving Sinclair, they found water. At first they thought it was a mirage. They turned away from it by mutual assent. But the horses had scented drink, and they became unmanageable. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the animals were up to their knees in the muddy water, and the men were floundering breast deep, drinking, drinking, drinking. After that they sat about the brink staring at one another in a stunned fashion. There seemed no joy in that delivery, for some reason. \"I guess Sinclair will be a pretty happy gent when he sees us coming back,\" said Sandersen, smiling faintly. There was no response from the others for a moment. Then they began to justify themselves...", "...occurred. The mighty waters of the Saskatchewan had been gathering force beneath the ice, and, pressing the great flooring upwards, at length gained such irresistible power that the whole ice-field shivered, and was broken up into gigantic slabs, until it resembled a vast mosaic. The horse attached to Jacques' sleigh was shot into a great rent, from which it was impossible to extricate it. They dared not stay a moment longer if they wished to escape with their lives. Then far five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they held their lives in their hands, but they proceeded cautiously and surely, jumping from berg to berg, the man encouraging the woman to fresh endeavour, until at last they gained the southern bank. Had they slipped or overbalanced themselves it would have been good-bye to this world. Pasmore and Douglas had to assist Dorothy up the steep banks, so great had been the strain and so great was the reaction. Nor was it to be wondered at, for it would have tried the nerves of...", "...on the gambling. In the centre of the table lies a thin slab of lead about six inches square, the sides of which represent the numbers one, two, three and four. The croupier has immediately in front of him a pile of bright copper cash, perhaps two pints. From these he takes a large double-handful, which he places well on the table and covers with a small metal bowl. Now is the time for making bets on the four numbers. Suppose we put a dollar on number three. In the course of a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> all those who desire to bet have done so, stakes from the first floor being put into a basket by an attendant and lowered on to the table by means of a string, and the little square of lead is surrounded with coins, notes and counters arranged by the shroff. Now the croupier, with a thin stick about a foot in length, commences to scrape away four coins at a time from the double-handful of cash. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, and so on. The little heap begins to...", "...I feared they might wish me to give up my journey and discover my identity to my companions. The pleasant sound of church bells roused me next morning. My companions told me that this was the Sunday of the infidels and their holiday. One of the men-of-war in our neighbourhood was beflagged all over. I observed, after a while, that a boat, manned by sailors in full uniform, was sent from her to the shore, and returned to the ship immediately with an officer in full uniform. In about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we were called upon to draw nearer to the Russian vessel, and I perceived that several fair-haired officers were standing near the gangway. The nearer I approached the faster beat my heart, and I tried, as well as I could, to place myself in such a way as not to have to meet their eyes. The day being a holiday the search was made very superficially, their interpreter exchanging a few words with Yakub, whilst the officers were making fun of our party of beggars.

I had not much confidence in the result, however, but I felt quite complimented when a number of the leading men of the Minnesota Grange, who were present at the argument, made me a complimentary visit at the hotel that evening. The attorney for the railroad company who was expected to make the closing argument in the case complained that he did not feel very well and only spoke about fifteen or twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in a general way, without going into the facts or figures in the case. My supposed assistant, the Attorney General of the state of Iowa, took no part in the argument, and on my way home that night I learned that he had been in conference with Mr. Stickney of the Chicago Great Western Railroad Company, and had made an arrangement with that gentleman for employment as attorney for that corporation, to take effect at the close of his then official term which was to occur in a few...", "...I said before, my job is purely administrative.

He came early in the morning, instantly after breakfast. Not two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had passed before she was at home with him. His words, his looks, revived her spirit of romance, gave her the very landscapes, and new ones. Yes, he was her hero. But his manner made him also an adored big brother, stamped splendid by the perils of life. He sat square, as if alert to rise, with an elbow on a knee, and the readiest turn of head to speakers, the promptest of answers, eyes that were a brighter accent to the mouth, so vividly did look accompany tone. He rallied...", "...of the President's receptions; and further on Prescott saw the name of Mr. Sefton. There was nothing by which he could tell with certainty, but he inferred that she had gone there with the Secretary. A sudden thought assailed and tormented him. What could the Secretary be to her? Well, why not? Mr. Sefton was an able and insinuating man. Moreover, he was no bitter partisan: the fact that she believed in the cause of the North would not trouble him. She had refused himself and not many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later had been seen talking with the Secretary in what seemed to be the most confidential manner. Why had she come back to Richmond, from which she had escaped amid such dangers? Did it not mean that she and the Secretary had become allies more than friends? The thought would not let Prescott rest. Prescott put the newspaper in his pocket and left the little tavern with an abruptness that astonished his host, setting out upon his ride with increased haste and turning...", "...his small, fierce and peculiarly piercing eyes warily scrutinizing the lake in all directions. Then, lifting his black head, which gleamed in the sun with green, purple, and sapphire iridescence, he gave vent to a strange wild cry like a peal of bitter laughter. The cry echoed hollowly from the desolate shores of the lake. A moment or two later it was answered, in the same hollow and disconcerting tones, and from behind the islet his mate came swimming to meet him. For a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the two great birds swam slowly around each other, uttering several times their weird cry. As they floated at their ease, unalarmed, they sat high in the water, showing something of the clean pearly whiteness of their breasts and under parts. Their sturdy, trimly modelled bodies were about three feet in length, from the tips of their straight and formidable green beaks to the ends of their short stiff tails. Their heads, as we have seen, were of an intense and iridescent black,...", "...country which we crossed during these three days was completely checkered with elk trails, mud-wallows, slivered trees, and many other evidences that large bands of elk had occupied the country for months; and my packer insisted that we would surely find them if we continued hunting in the rough mountains which lay to the east. Early the next day, while at the brook making my morning toilet, I heard Stewart say to the cook that the horses had gone out of the country; and after two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of very vehement remarks, he informed me that five horses had taken the back trail, and that Worth must go with him to head them off. So, each taking a horse, they rode away, leaving me to keep camp with only old Scoop Shovel, a split-eared packhorse, for company. Always having loved nature, I concluded that a little prospecting on my own hook would be preferable to lounging about camp waiting for the return of the men and horses; so, saddling old Scoop Shovel, I forded the...", "...gawk's hungry!\" she exclaimed! \"And I never got the dope on her. Ain't I the simp!\" The girl regained a degree of self-control, and showed something of forlorn dignity. \"Yes,\" she said dully, \"I'm starving.\" Mary regarded the afflicted creature with that sympathy born only of experience. \"Yes,\" she said softly, \"I understand.\" Then she spoke to Aggie. \"Take her to my room, and let her rest there for a while. Have her drink the egg and milk slowly, and then lie down for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> anyhow.\" Aggie obeyed with an air of bustling activity. \"Sure, I will!\" she declared. She went to the girl and helped her to stand up. \"We'll fix you out all right,\" she said, comfortingly. \"Come along with me.... Hungry! Gee, but that's tough!\" Half an hour afterward, while Mary was at her desk, giving part of her attention to Joe Garson, who sat near, and part to a rather formidable pile of neatly arranged papers, Aggie reported with her charge, who, though still...", "...the log or rock on which he rests, rise to the surface, as is their wont when feeding, and are snapped out by a lightning sweep of the paws.

The raccoon undoubtedly catches crabs and little fish in this way; and I have sometimes surprised cats--both wildcats and Canada lynxes, as well as domestic tabbies--with their heads down close to the water, so still that they seemed part of the log or rock on which they crouched. Once I tried for five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to make a guide see a big lynx that was lying on a root in plain sight within thirty yards of our canoe, while the guide assured me in a whisper that he could see perfectly and that it was only a stump. Then, hearing us, the lynx rose, stared, and leaped for the brush. Such hiding would easily deceive even a trout, for I have often taken my position at the edge of a jam and after lying perfectly still for ten minutes have seen the wary fish rise from under the logs to...", "...the words, and the death dew was on his forehead. \"Remember it not, Diccon,\" I entreated. \"I too was to blame. And I see not that night for other nights,--for other nights and days, Diccon.\" He smiled, but there was still in his face a shadowy eagerness. \"You said you would never strike me again,\" he went on, \"and that I was man of yours no more for ever--and you gave me my freedom in the paper which I tore.\" He spoke in gasps, with his eyes upon mine. \"I'll be gone in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> now.

A brightness came into his face, and he faintly pressed my hand. I slipped my arm beneath him and raised him a little higher to meet his death.

This silence frightened Don Pedro. He attempted to spring into his saddle, but he was surrounded, and a man-at-arms held the bridle of his horse. An officer asked him to wait in a neighboring tent. Resistance was impossible, and he silently obeyed. Here he found himself encompassed by a voiceless group, through whose lines, after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of dread suspense, a man in full armor advanced. It was Henry of Trastamara, who now faced his brother for the first time in fifteen years. He gazed with searching eyes upon Don Pedro and his followers. \"Where is this bastard,\" he harshly asked, \"this Jew who calls himself King of Castile?\" \"There stands your enemy,\" said a French esquire, pointing to Don Pedro. Henry gazed at him fixedly. So many years had elapsed that he failed to recognize him easily. \"Yes, it is...", "...I dare not say what I think, even to you, Brace!\" There was a contraction of the young man's features, as an inkling of the meaning of his mother's hastily-spoken words flashed across his mind. Then, rising, he began to pace the room with impatient strides, for there was a sense of disappointment at his heart which he could not overcome; and in spite of his efforts, there seemed to be continually before him the sweet, timid face and the reclining figure that he had for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> supported; while, as he pondered upon his mothers words, again piecing together her long narrative, it seemed to him that he was every minute being removed further and further from one who had made what in another case he would have called an impression upon a susceptible nature. It was as though each moment a deep, black gulf was opening wider and wider between them--a gulf that it would be impossible for him ever to pass.

Some hours later the long, heavily laden train stopped at the foot of the steep grade just east of Euston, and was cut in two in order that half of it might be drawn to the top at a time. Rear Brakeman Joe was left to guard the part of the train that remained behind, and he did this by walking back a few hundred yards along the track, and placing a torpedo on top of one of the rails.

Kat almost always said \"Why?\" and when she didn't, Kit did. \"To take flax and...", "...Virginia turned her head, until finally her wandering eyes met his, fixed on her with passionate intensity.

In five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after she began to dress, everything was in confusion, not an article remained in its proper place, and when at last she sailed through the doorway, arrayed in whatever might chance to be the extreme of the then fashion, she left a chaos behind, suggestive of nothing but a ship-wreck of millinery, jewellery, laces, silks, and all the other accessories of a lady's toilette. How Mrs. Mortomley ever managed to evolve a presentable appearance out of such a whirlwind of confusion,...", "...Alaska, is the universal flapjack.

As a matter of fact, Lucia and Peppino were in the midst of a most serious conversation when Georgie...", "...over eighteen.

Originally, then, the Tennessee Synod was determined to be and to remain a purely German-speaking body. 88. Attitude toward the English Language.--That the interest manifested by the Tennessee Synod in the German language was not due to any unreasonable prejudice or hatred toward the English language as such, appears from the fact that since 1821 the minutes of Synod were printed both in English and German. Moreover, in the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of the second convention, 1821, we read: \"At the request of some of our brethren of North Carolina it was resolved that there be annually a synod held in North Carolina, or in an adjoining State in the English language.

At the office they told Shirley that her aunt had already come in and gone to her room, so she hurried upstairs to dress for dinner while Jefferson proceeded to the Hotel de l'Athenee on the same mission. He had still twenty-five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before dinner time, and he needed only ten minutes for a wash and to jump into his dress suit, so, instead of going directly to his hotel, he sat down at the Cafe de la Paix. He was thirsty, and calling for a vermouth _frappe_ he told the _garcon_ to bring him also the American papers. The crowd on the boulevard was denser than ever. The business offices and some of the shops were closing, and a vast army of employes, homeward bound, helped to swell the sea of humanity that...", "...the second time. Tavernake felt his heart sink as he listened. \"Very well,\" she said. \"I thought that you were my friend, that you wished to help me.\" \"I do,\" he replied, \"but you would not have me break my word?\" \"You are breaking your word with me,\" she told him. \"It is a different thing,\" he insisted. \"You will not take me there?\" she said once more. \"I cannot,\" Tavernake answered. \"Very well, good-bye!\" \"Don't go,\" he begged. \"Can't I see you somewhere for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> this evening?\" \"I am afraid not,\" Elizabeth replied coolly. \"Are you going out?\" he persisted. \"I am going to the Duke of York's Theatre with some friends,\" she answered. \"I am sorry. You have disappointed me.\" She rang off and he turned away from the telephone booth into the street. It seemed to him, as he walked down the crowded thoroughfare, that some reflection of his own self-contempt was visible in the countenances of the men and women who were hurrying past...", "...glimpse he had caught the night before when the matches were struck was not particularly illuminating. He had a dim idea that Sam was below the medium height; with thin, sallow face; small, narrow eyes; a slouching gait; and a head that was not wide enough from front to back. He had a feeling that Sam had not room enough in his brain for seeing all that ought to be seen. Sam did not understand about education. Would he ever be able to make him understand? Sam came shuffling along ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after twelve. His sense of dignity would not have allowed him to be on time. Besides, he wanted to see if Michael would wait as he had said. It was a part of the testing of Michael; not to prove if he were really Mikky, but to see what stuff he was made of, and how much he really had meant of what he said. Michael was there, standing anxiously outside the eating house. He did not enjoy the surroundings nor the attention he was attracting. He was too well dressed for that...", "...he incessantly directed out to sea, or glances at the deck forward, or around at the helm, so far as he might move his head without shifting his attitude. It was as though his mind were in labour with some scheme. A man might so look whilst working out the complicated plot of a play, or adjusting by the exertion of his memory the intricacies of a novel piece of mechanism. [Illustration: \"STRETCHED AT HIS EASE IN A FOLDING CHAIR.\"] On a sudden he started up and went below. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after he had left the deck, Captain North came up from his cabin, and for some while we paced the planks together. There was a pleasant hush upon the ship; the silence was as refreshing as a fold of coolness lifting off the sea. A spun-yarn winch was clinking on the forecastle; from alongside rose the music of fretted waters. I was talking to the captain on some detail of the ship's furniture; when Major Hood came running up the companion steps, his face as white as his...", "...that bespoke service. They wheeled past the church of St. Roch, and entered a small street off the Rue St. Honore called La Dauphine, where, no sooner had they passed in, than the sappers commenced tearing up the pavement in front of the guns, and speedily formed a trench of about five feet in depth before them. While this was doing, some mounted dragoons gave orders to the people to disperse, and directed them to move away by the side streets,--an order so promptly obeyed that in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the long line of the Rue St. Honore was totally deserted. From the position at La Dauphine to the Tuileries I could perceive that a line of communication was kept open, and orderlies passed at a gallop frequently from one side to the other. Another circumstance, too, struck me: the windows, instead of being crowded by numbers of eager spectators, were strongly shuttered and barred; and when that was impossible, the glass frames were withdrawn, and bed-mattresses and tables...", "...Then, above the din of the gunfire and curses of the deputies, the final verse of \"Hold the Fort\" rang out in defiance of industrial tyranny, and with the termination of the words \"Cheer, my comrades, cheer!\" the bright red death-foam flecked the ever-to-be silent lips of the brave Swedish revolutionist. Splintering the stairways, seats and woodwork, and wounding many of the men crouched in hiding, thousands of rounds of ammunition found their way into the boat during the ten long <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of the onslaught. Finally, with a 41 Colts revolver to enforce his demand, J. F. Billings ordered engineer Ernest Shellgren to back the boat away from the dock. With no pilot at the wheel the propeller churned madly backward for a moment, the bowline drew taut and snapped, and the Verona pulled away from the murderous crew of vigilantes. Not content with the havoc they had wrought at close quarters some of the deputies continued to fire as long as the boat was within range, a...", "...of our country by the Ku Klux Klan; and I knew enough about studio methods to be sure they had not thrown away the costumes, but would have them stored.

Yes, Mr. T-S was there, but he was \"on the lot\" and could not be disturbed. I gave my name, and stated that it was a matter of life and death; Mr. T-S must come to the phone instantly. A couple of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later I heard his voice, and told him the situation, and also my scheme. He must come himself, to make sure that his orders were obeyed; he must bring several bus-loads of men, clad in the full regalia of Mobland's great Secret Society; and they must arrive at Abell's place precisely on the stroke of midnight. The men must be paid five dollars apiece, and be told that if they succeeded in bringing away the prophet unharmed, they would each get ten dollars extra. \"I will put up...", "...to his talk. So, handing him a cigar, as a prefatory to conversation, I asked him our whereabouts. \"Four hundred miles to the heast'ard of Georges we were this noon, and we've made nothink to speak of since, Sir. This last tack has lost us all we made before. I hought to know where we are. I've drifted 'ere without even a 'en-coop hunder me. I was third mate aboard the barque 'Jenny,' of Belfast, when she was run down by the steamer 'United States.' The barque sunk in less than seven <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the steamer struck us, and I come up out of her suction-like. I found myself swimming there, on top, and not so much as a capstan-bar to make me a life-buoy. I knew the steamer was hove to, for I could hear her blow hoff steam; and once, as I came up on a wave, I got a sight of her boats. They were ready enough to pick us up, and we was ready enough to be picked up, such as were left; but how to do it was another matter, with a sea like this running, and a cloud over the...", "...to conduct us to Sourabaya.

With a perseverance worthy of a better cause the skipper nudged the cook's arm and tried again. This time he was successful beyond his wildest dreams, and, after ten minutes' frantic search, found that he had lost them both. He wandered up and down for hours, and it was past eleven when he returned to the ship and found the cook waiting for him. \"We thought something 'ad happened to you,\" said the cook. \"Kate has been in a fine way about it. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after you lost me she found me, and we've been hunting 'igh and low ever since.\" Miss Jewell expressed her relief the next evening, and, stealing a glance at the face of the skipper, experienced a twinge of something which she took to be remorse. Ignoring the cook's hints as to theatres, she elected to go for a long 'bus ride, and, sitting in front with the skipper, left Mr. Jewell to keep a chaperon's eye on them from three seats behind. Conversation was for some time...", "...thought, Uncle Jim decided that Irma's plan was practicable. But he wished her to wait in a phaeton, to whose driver he gave explicit directions not to go more than a block from the post-office door. But when after a quarter of an hour neither Uncle Jim nor Aunt Caroline had appeared, Irma was greatly disturbed. \"I wouldn't make a good Casabianca,\" she thought. Some of her friends from the _Ariadne_ passed her, and one or two stopped to advise her. \"They would have been here ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago, had they expected to meet you here.\" \"No, they are probably waiting for you at the landing.\" Even the driver shared this view, and at a quarter of eight Irma drove down to the boat escorted by the carriage in which sat Muriel and her mother and governess. \"You must stay with us,\" said Muriel, \"until you find your aunt. She's probably on the tender.\" But just at this moment a hand was laid on Irma's arm. Turning about, she saw that the little old gentleman was beside...", "...ingenuous features, and saw in them the fastidious fineness which had caused her to recoil so sensitively from her son's display at the Grand Babylon.

And Carthew slammed the door on him like a conjuror performing the final act of a trick before an audience of three thousand people. Mr. Prohack was late. He was late on this the first full day of his...", "...\"Bravo, bravo!\" exclaimed I, with irrepressible enthusiasm; \"this shows the liberality of the age; this proves, if anything can, that all musty prejudices are in a fair way to be obliterated. And how will Christian rejoice to hear of this happy transformation of his old antagonist! I promise myself great pleasure in informing him of it when we reach the Celestial City.\" The passengers being all comfortably seated, we now rattled away merrily, accomplishing a greater distance in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> than Christian probably trudged over in a day. It was laughable, while we glanced along, as it were, at the tail of a thunderbolt, to observe two dusty foot travellers in the old pilgrim guise, with cockle shell and staff, their mystic rolls of parchment in their hands and their intolerable burdens on their backs. The preposterous obstinacy of these honest people in persisting to groan and stumble along the difficult pathway rather than take advantage of modern improvements,...", "...you in a moment.\" I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission and determined revolt.

The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament. As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a...", "...sometimes bring out two or three carp weighing several pounds each. The fish commonly caught are mullet, perch, barbel, gudgeon, bream, and chub. As a food-supplying river, the Dordogne is one of the most valuable in France, and, owing to the rapid current and the purity of the water, the fish is of excellent quality. The fixed belief of all the riverside people in this and other valleys is that fish should be cooked alive. You enter an inn and ask for a _friture_ of gudgeon. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> you see the victims, which have been pulled out of a tank with a small net on the end of a stick, jumping on the kitchen table, and they are still jumping when they go into the boiling grease. I am not among those who have grown callous to such sights, common as they are in France. To see fish scraped, opened, and cooked while still alive gives me disgust for it when it afterwards appears on the table. I can imagine somebody saying: 'Why look at what goes on in the kitchen?'...", "...him.\" \"What's going to happen next, Em?\" said Lou hollowly. \"What's he going to do?\" * * * * * Lou and Emerald stayed fearfully awake almost all night, waiting to see what Gramps was going to do. But not a sound came from the sacred bedroom. Two hours before dawn, they finally dropped off to sleep. At six o'clock, they arose again, for it was time for their generation to eat breakfast in the kitchenette. No one spoke to them. They had twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in which to eat, but their reflexes were so dulled by the bad night that they had hardly swallowed two mouthfuls of egg-type processed seaweed before it was time to surrender their places to their son's generation. Then, as was the custom for whoever had been most recently disinherited, they began preparing Gramps' breakfast, which would presently be served to him in bed, on a tray. They tried to be cheerful about it. The toughest part of the job was having to handle the...", "...be clearly expressed and understood, and the answer will be in accordance with those conditions. 57.--WHAT WAS THE TIME? \"I say, Rackbrane, what is the time?\" an acquaintance asked our friend the professor the other day. The answer was certainly curious. \"If you add one quarter of the time from noon till now to half the time from now till noon to-morrow, you will get the time exactly.\" What was the time of day when the professor spoke? 58.--A TIME PUZZLE.

Look around for the pistol or anything else you can find, although _I_ have been over the whole ground twice already.\" A little puff of dust as the horse sprang into the road, a muffled shuffle, struggle, then the regular beat of hoofs, and she was gone. After five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had passed, Cass regretted that he had not accompanied her: waiting in such a spot was an irksome task. Not that there was anything in the scene itself to awaken gloomy imaginings; the bright, truthful Californian sunshine scoffed at any illusion of creeping shadows or waving branches. Once, in the rising wind, the empty hat rolled over--but only in a ludicrous, drunken way. A search for any further sign or token had proved futile, and Cass grew impatient. He began to hate...", "...north-west of Vlieland. During the ten minutes we were on the water I loosened Lt.

He thrust the pick into the place from which he had removed his mark, and loosened the rubbish thoroughly. With his hands, and with his spade, he was not long in reducing the size of the heap by about one-half, and there he found more coins. There were three more crowns, two half-crowns, and a dozen or so of smaller coins. All these Mr. Batchel wrapped carefully in his handkerchief, and after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> rest went on with his task. As it proved, the task was nearly over. Some strips of oak about nine inches long, were next uncovered, and then, what Mr. Batchel had begun to expect, the lid of a box, with the hinges still attached.

How often, at hare and hounds, have I seen him mounted on a little knoll, cheering the whole field on to action, and waving his hat above his grey head, oblivious of King Charles the Martyr's head, and all belonging to it! How many a summer-hour have I known to be but blissful <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to him in the cricket-field! How many winter days have I seen him, standing blue-nosed in the snow and east wind, looking at the boys going down the long slide, and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture! He was an universal favorite, and his ingenuity in little things was transcendant. He could cut oranges into such devices as none of us had an idea of. He could make a boat out of anything, from a skewer upwards. He could turn crampbones into chessmen; fashion Roman chariots...", "...Testament. Here, however, it may be used in its strict sense of replying to a question, for it seems to us extremely probable that a portion of the discourse leading up to the statement made in verse 3 is omitted by the Evangelist. It is highly improbable that the whole discourse between Christ and Nicodemus is here recorded, as it seems very unlikely that Nicodemus, after the trouble of coming specially to Christ by night, left Him, or would be allowed to leave, after the two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in which the discourse here reported was spoken. *Born again.* The Greek word {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}, which is rendered \"again,\" may mean--(_a_) from above, or (_b_) again. The latter meaning, however, is more probable here, for so Nicodemus understood our Lord's words (see verse 4): so,...", "...getting any reply, he got up and went to the brook. There he came across the footmarks of his friend. Seeing these, he went back at once for the money and the horses, and bringing them with him, he tracked the prince to the lake, where he found him lying to all appearance dead. \"Alas! alas!\" he cried, and lifting up the prince, he poured some water over his head and face. \"Alas! my brother, what is this? Oh! do not die and leave me thus. Speak, speak! I cannot bear this!\" In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the prince, revived by the water, opened his eyes, and looked about wildly. \"Thank God!\" exclaimed the vizier's son. \"But what is the matter, brother?\" \"Go away,\" replied the prince. \"I don't want to say anything to you, or to see you. Go away.\" \"Come, come; let us leave this place. Look, I have brought some food for you, and horses, and everything. Let us eat and depart.\" \"Go alone,\" replied the prince. \"Never,\" said the vizier's son. \"What has happened to...", "...nothing about it to obsess men's minds. You might say it was the manoeuvres of 19-- all over again, with the chance of \"bumping a mine\" thrown in, and also the glorious certainty of ultimately seeing a twelve-inch salvo pitch exactly where the long years of preparation ordained that it should. A submarine specialist, whom the war caught doing exile in a \"big ship,\" dominated the conversation for a while with lamentations that he was constrained to dwell in the Tents of Kedah. Two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of his talk having nearly convinced everyone that the sole _raison d'etre_ of the big ship was to be sunk by submarine attack, he and his theories passed into a conversational siding. The watchkeepers exchanged mutual condolences on the exasperating tactics of drift-net trawlers, notes on atmospheric conditions prevalent in the North Sea, methods of removing nocturnal cocoa-stains from the more vital portions of a chart, and other matters of interest to watchkeepers. The...", "...box. The runaways, after a warm and uncomfortable drive of three-quarters of an hour, during which the cook wept bitterly and was very unwell, reached the station. Contrary to the Vidame's wish, Mrs. Brown-Smith, in an ulster and a veil, insisted on perambulating the platform, buying the whole of Mr. Hall Caine's works as far as they exist in sixpenny editions. Bells rang, porters stationed themselves in a line, like fielders, a train arrived, the 9.17 from Liverpool, twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> late. A short stout gentleman emerged from a smoking carriage, Mrs. Brown-Smith, starting from the Vidame's side, raised her veil, and threw her arms round the neck of the traveller. 'You didn't expect _me_ to meet you on such a night, did you, Johnnie?' she cried with a break in her voice. 'Awfully glad to see you, Tiny,' said the short gentleman. 'On such a night!' After thus unconsciously quoting the _Merchant of Venice_, Mr. Brown-Smith turned to his valet. 'Don't...", "...low water rendered available for the purpose of the skipper in eluding his swift pursuer. The channel was about four feet deep; and Dory hauled in the fore sheet, and went through it. Under the lee of the island the skipper found the water quiet. Throwing the boat up into the wind, he ran forward, and hauled down the jib. Then he threw over the anchor, leaving the foresail set. It was getting dark, and the manoeuvring could not be kept up much longer. It would be fifteen or twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before the Sylph could come up with St. Alban's Point. The Goldwing was behind the island, and he did not think the people on board of her would discover where she was. If they did, she could not follow him through the shoal passage. If she got out her boats again, he could run off to the northward under the foresail. All he had to do was to watch and wait. He had still a considerable supply of ham and hard-bread and cheese in the cabin; and, while he watched and waited, he...", "...hurried down. As I reached the lower hall, I remembered that I had not the least idea which door led into the dining-room, and so had to try three or four which gave no evidence of being inhabited, furniture being covered and windows closed, before I hit upon the right one. I entered hesitatingly, not discovering, till I was fairly in the room, that I was the only occupant of it. The table was laid for two, and the dinner was already served, but the master was not yet down. As some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed and he did not appear, I had time to look around, and get acquainted with the _salle a manger._ It was a fine room, old-fashioned though it was; and modern architecture has still to produce its rival in my eyes. The ceiling was very high, the fireplace wide, with tiled jambs; the wood-work carved in stiff but stately patterns; the windows were deep, with enticing window-seats, and the walls were covered with pictures. Pictures, I imagined, of people who had once owned...", "...attended him as silently, and with close observation. He did not suffer any thing to divert him from the business he had in hand, nor did he seem to be in the least desirous to have it quickly dispatched, but paid this last rite with an attention that did honour to his feelings as a man, as it seemed the result of an heartfelt affection for the object of it, of whose person nothing now remained but a piece or two of calcined bone. When his melancholy work was ended, he stood for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with his hands folded over his bosom, and his eye fixed upon his labours in the attitude of a man in profound thought. Perhaps in that small interval of time many ideas presented themselves to his imagination. His hands had just completed the last service he could render to a woman who, no doubt, had been useful to him; one to whom he was certainly attached (of many instances of which we had at different times been witness) and one who had left him a living pledge of some...", "...at leisure, and see which is stronger. His sword was taken from him at Wesel; sword, uniform, every mark of dignity, all are now gone: he is clad in brown prison-dress of the plainest cut and cloth; his diet is fixed at tenpence a day (\"to be got from the cook's shop, six groschen for dinner, four for supper\"); [Order, 14th September, 1730 (in Forster, i. 372).] food to be cut for him, no knife allowed. Room is to be opened, morning, noon and evening, \"on the average not above four <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> each time;\" lights, or single tallow-light, to be extinguished at seven P.M. Absolute solitude; no flute allowed, far from it; no books allowed, except the Bible and a Prayer-Book,--or perhaps Noltenius's MANUAL, if he took a hankering for it. There, shut out from the babble of fools, and conversing only with the dumb Veracities, with the huge inarticulate meanings of Destiny, Necessity and Eternity, let the fool of a Fritz bethink himself, if there is any thought in him!...", "...You ought not to be out with such a cold at night, my boy,\" he answered. \"You will find a decanter of the Scotch whisky you gave me last Christmas on the tray. Will you have some with hot water and a lemon, George? The servants are all at the theater--Gerald begged a holiday for them--but Barnes will get you the things in a minute.\" \"Thank you; I won't trouble him. I will take some with cold water,\" I replied, thinking I should gain in this way what I wanted--time to think; five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to myself while they played. But I was out of my reckoning. \"I will have mine now, too,\" he said. \"Will you mix it, Gerald?\" Gerald jumped up to do it, with tolerable alacrity. I sat still, preferring to help myself when he should have attended to his father, if his father it was. I felt more easy now that I had those papers in my pocket. The more I thought of it the more certain I became that they were the object aimed at by whatever deviltry was on foot, and that...", "...depends upon his future treatment. I wish this young man to remain a little longer, for you must now decide upon what course you will take. We have been called in an emergency. There is no need that I should remain any longer, for the physician who accompanied him here is now amply competent to attend to the case. You have, however, expressed lack of confidence in us, and may wish to send for your own physician. If so, this young man can go for him at once. I can prove to you in two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> that I am right, and I intend to do so; then my responsibility ceases. Everything depends on your intelligent and firm co-operation with whatever physician has charge of the case, and it is no kindness to leave you under a delusion that does your heart more credit than your head or eyes.\" He stepped back through the curtained doorway, and returned with her husband's vest, from an inner pocket of which he took a hypodermic syringe, a bottle of Magendie's solution, and also...", "...she dared not add. \"I hope Mr. Lindsay will pardon my giving him this trouble,\" said the latter; \"we have one thing in common which should forbid our being strangers to each other. I, at least, was unwilling to leave Scotland without making myself known to Mr. Lindsay.\" Mr. Lindsay most devoutly wished the \"thing in common\" had been anything else. He bowed, and was \"happy to have the pleasure,\" but evidently neither pleased nor happy. Ellen could see that. \"May I take up five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of Mr. Lindsay's time to explain, perhaps to apologise,\" said John, slightly smiling, \"for what I have said?\" A little ashamed, it might be, to have his feeling suspected, Mr. Lindsay instantly granted the request, and politely invited his unwelcome guest to be seated. Obeying a glance from her brother which she understood, Ellen withdrew to the further side of the room, where she could not hear what they said. John took up the history of Ellen's acquaintance with his family,...", "...too.\" \"That would give the whole show away, if they saw you, the Prefect of Police.\" \"Why, no. If they see me--and they know I ought to be there--as soon as I show myself to them they will conclude I don't know anything about it.\" \"You are wrong.\" \"It is my duty. I should be near the general to defend him until the last.\" Rouletabille shrugged his shoulders before this dangerous heroism, but he did not stop to argue. He knew that his plan must succeed at once, or in five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at the latest there would be only ruins, the dead and the dying in the datcha des Iles. Still he remained astonishingly calm. In principle he had admitted that he was going to die. The only hope of being saved which remained to them rested entirely upon their keeping perfectly cool and upon the patience of the living bombs. Would they still have three minutes' patience? Ermolai went ahead of Koupriane and Rouletabille. At the moment they reached the foot of the veranda...", "...attention to it. He acted with the precipitancy of a school fugitive running away from a truant officer. He saw just one chance to evade an unpleasant overhauling by the ironclad, and took it. This was to instantly steer to the north and shoot down the narrow neck of water lying between the wooded island and the nearest sand island. Dave knew that this channel must be quite shallow. He doubted if the cumbersome iron-clad could navigate it. Even if it tried to, it would be some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before its crew could swing around into position to make the chase. The launch took the channel like an arrow. Dave's spirits rose high, notwithstanding some loud and quite peremptory hails from the direction of the gunboat. \"Better than before,\" soliloquized Dave. \"I can swing around the sandbars directly to the anchorage of the _Swallow_.\" Glancing back, Dave saw that the gunboat did not intend to follow the course he had taken. That craft had stopped and put...", "...in camp, for four drovers came in with two dozen horses that had been ordered for the use of the engineering party. \"Step outside, Reade, and see the horses, if you care to do so,\" suggested Mr. Thurston, reaching for his sombrero. \"Thank you, sir; but the horses will keep, and I'm greatly interested in finishing my drawing so that I can take up more work.\" \"That young cub, Reade, is no idler.\" thought the chief, as he stepped into the open. Tom kept steadily at work. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, Thurston still being absent, Eugene Black strolled into the tent. He glanced at Tom's drawing with some contempt, then inquired: \"Drawing, boy?\" \"Why, not?\" laughed Tom. \"I'm only one of the stable boys, and, as you can see, I'm currying a horse.\" \"Stop that sort of nonsense with me, right at the start,\" flashed Black angrily, striding closer. \"I don't allow boys to be fresh with me.\" \"Where's the boy?\" drawled Tom, turning slightly, for a better view \\ of...", "...leaves of a lime tree rustled in the wind and detached themselves one by one. We rang the bell. While we waited, I was conscious of being watched, and, glancing up quickly, I saw the curtain at one of the windows fall back into place. The door opened a crack, and a white face with a long, thin nose, and horn-rimmed spectacles with smoky glass to hide the eyes, peered out at us furtively. Mr. Douglas handed the spy his card and the door was shut softly in our faces. In about three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the door was opened again, and a gendarme in uniform ushered us into a long room thick with stale tobacco-smoke. He gave me a chair, and while we waited I looked about at the walls with the brightly colored portraits of the Czar and the Czarina and the royal family, and the ikon in one corner. \"Give up all hope all ye who enter here.\" The room was silent except for the scratch of pens on paper. The secret-service spies sat at long tables, writing laboriously, and smoking....", "...into the distance through a veil of abstraction. \"We will have to go,\" she said tonelessly. \"There is no other way.\" They passed by the inert figure on the floor and out, Kendric with his left hand always on her arm. Again the knife was hidden under his coat, but his fingers did not release it. \"Quick,\" he said again. So Zoraida, obedient in this strange new mood governing her, making no effort to shake off his hand having no thought to gainsay him, hastened. In perhaps five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they were unlocking the last door, and Kendric heard beyond the whining of the puma. Kendric had had time for thought during this brief interval which had seemed much longer; for the present both his safety and Betty's would undoubtedly depend upon his keeping Zoraida with him. So now, as he flung open the door, he carried Zoraida along into the room. At first he did not see the cat lying close to the cage; he saw only Betty. A little color had come back into her cheeks;...", "...No trace of acidity was there about her now. Her manner was soft, indeed affectionate, and she looked up into his disfigured countenance quite delightfully, instead of turning from it in aversion as heretofore. Why on earth couldn't she be like this always, he thought regretfully, feeling softened and relenting, under the combined influence of the soothing surroundings and an excellent lunch. In the afternoon sport mended, and more than once a \"boil\" came on the water, for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> only, but so lively while it lasted that they took out trout almost with every cast, and then he noticed how carefully in the background Cynthia kept, and when he hung up his cast in that confounded elder tree just as the rise began, she it was who came to the rescue of his impatience, and so deftly and quickly disentangled the flies. Why on earth could not she always be like that? And then, during the two-mile walk home together in the glowing beauty of the cloudless evening...", "...(so-called) \"water-tight\" doors, and gradually over the whole ship. There was no time to be lost. Captain Dawkins called out to his men that if they preserved order all would be saved. The men stood as at an inspection--not one moved until ordered to do so. The boats of both ships were lowered. While the launching was going on, the swell of the tide caused a lifeboat to surge against the hull, and one of the crew had his finger crushed. This was absolutely the only casualty. In twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the whole of the men were transferred to the _Iron Duke_, no single breach of discipline occurring beyond the understandable request of a sailor once in awhile to be allowed to make one effort to secure some keepsake or article of special value to himself. But the order was stern: \"Boys, come instantly.\" As \"four bells\" (2 p.m.) was striking, the last man having been received on the _Iron Duke_, the doomed vessel whirled round two or three times, and then sank in deep...", "...the seeds; scald the slices for ten minutes, plunge them into cold water, and drain them.

Tie round with a string, pour a pint of strong stock into the dish, and bake twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in a slow oven. When done, take up the cucumber, drain, and remove the bacon carefully so as not to disturb the stuffing. Lay in a dish, and serve with Robert sauce.

For a minute or two the welkin rings with shouts, shots (mainly those of the startled Indians), then there is as sudden a rush back to cover, without a man or horse hurt or missing. In the excitement and darkness the Cheyennes could only fire wild, but now the night air resounds with taunts and yells and triumphant war-whoops. For full five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> there is a jubilee over the belief that they have penned in the white soldiers after their dash for liberty. Then, little by little, the yells and taunts subside. Something has happened to create discussion in the Cheyenne camps, for the crouching soldiers can hear the liveliest kind of a pow-wow far up-stream. What does it mean? Has Ray slipped through, or--have they caught him? Despite pain and weakness, Wayne hobbles out to where Sergeant Roach is still watching and asks...", "...uncushioned English third-class. The third closely resemble cattle-trucks with benches running along the sides and down the middle. They have no windows; leather curtains protect their open sides. We went second-class, as did the majority of our fellow-travellers. Long before the hour of starting, every carriage, with the exception of the firsts, which were almost empty, was packed full of passengers, all talking at the pitch of their voices. But nothing happened until quite forty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the time fixed for departure, when the engine gave a violent jerk, as though putting all its strength into a superhuman effort, the women crossed themselves devoutly, and the train moved slowly out of the station. So slowly indeed, that three late-comers, arriving on the platform after the train was in motion, not only succeeded in entering the train but were able, by running forward, to secure places in the front carriages.

Juve gave hasty directions: \"It's all right. I know the house. It has only one exit. You, Ramot,\" he went on, addressing the young woman, \"go up to the first floor and take your place at a table; here are ten dollars, order champagne and don't be too stiff with the company.\" Josephine nodded and went upstairs. Juve and Fandor followed a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later and took up a strategic position at a table near the doorway. Fandor had a view of the room and Juve commanded the hall and stairway. From the room came a confused hum of laughter, cries and doubtful jokes. A negro, clad in red and armed with a gong, capered among the tables, dancing and singing. Fandor caught sight of Josephine, who appeared to be carrying out Juve's instructions. Beside her was a fair giant of red complexion and clean-shaven face, whose Anglo-Saxon...", "...Defeating some local volunteers who molested him, Lord George learned from the prisoners that the duke with four thousand men was close at hand, and he sent on the news to the prince, who despatched two regiments, the Stuarts of Appin and the Macphersons of Cluny, to reinforce him. It was nearly dark when by the light of the moon Lord George saw the English infantry, who had now dismounted, advancing. He at once charged them at the head of the Macphersons and Stuarts, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the English were completely defeated, their commander, Colonel Honeywood, being left severely wounded on the field, with a hundred killed or disabled men, while the loss of the Scotch was but twelve. It was with great difficulty that the Highlanders could be recalled from the pursuit, and Lord George himself sent an urgent message to the prince begging for a further reinforcement, in order that he might maintain his ground and defeat the whole force of the duke. As usual his...", "...wings, the butterfly can fly for a long time. But this flight is not in the least regular; it is not made in a straight line. When the insect has to go some distance, it flies alternately up and down. The line it takes is composed of an infinity of zig-zags, going up and down, and from right to left. This irregularity of flight saves the little insect from falling a prey to birds. \"I saw one day with pleasure,\" says Reaumur, \"a sparrow which pursued in the air a butterfly for nearly ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> without being able to catch it. The flight of the bird was nevertheless considerably more rapid than that of the butterfly, but the butterfly was always higher or lower than the place to which the bird flew, and where it thought it would catch it.\" But let us leave the wings to pass on to the other parts of the butterfly. These other parts are the _thorax_ or chest, the body or _abdomen_, and the _head_. The thorax is solidly put together, so as to bear the movements of...", "...of them that I showed the white feather, and, not knowing me as well as they might, they were disgusted.

This was what the Heavenly Twins called giving the school children a treat, and they told Mr. Ellis afterward that they enjoyed doing good very much. \"What shall we do now?\" said Diavolo as they walked their ponies aimlessly down the street when that episode was over. \"Let's call on grandpapa and the bishop,\" Angelica suggested. \"The bishop first, then,\" said Diavolo. \"They've such good cakes at the palace.\" \"Well, that's just why we should do...", "...combined to render him dear to the young girl, whose life had hitherto passed away calmly, nothing happening to cast a cloud over her heart. Many times since the young man's departure she stopped in her work, raised her head, looked anxiously around her, and then resumed her toil, while stifling a sigh. Mothers are quick-sighted, especially those who, like Mrs. Black, really love their daughters. What her husband and son did not suspect, then, she guessed merely by looking for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at the poor girl's pale face, her eyes surrounded by a dark ring, her pensive look, and inattention. Diana was in love. Mrs. Black looked around her. No one could be the object of that love. So far back as she could remember, she called to mind no one her daughter had appeared to distinguish before their departure from the clearing, where she had passed her youth. Besides, when the little party set out in search of a fresh home, Diana seemed joyful, she prattled gaily as...", "...Salter,\" he remarked. The man nodded. \"We want it.

The approach to it looked like a canal, and they descended the shallow shaft amid a thin cascade. The tunnel slanted, for the lode dipped, and the pale lights that twinkled here and there among the timbering showed shadowy, half-naked figures toiling in water which rose well up their boots. Further streams of it ran in from fissures; and Vane's face grew grave as he plodded through the flood with a lamp in his hand. He spent an hour in the...", "...after another, \"it's like trying to get through hell to get to Paradise ... I've been seven hours driving about four miles there and back.

It would have needed no deluge to finish New York if that maddening pall of darkness had remained unbroken a few hours longer. But, just when thousands had given up in despair, there came a rapid change. At the hour of noon light suddenly broke overhead. Beginning in a round patch inclosed in an iridescent halo, it spread swiftly, seeming to melt its way down through the thick, dark mass that choked the air, and in less than fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> New York and all its surroundings emerged into the golden light of noonday. People who had expected at any moment to feel the water pitilessly rising about them looked out of their windows, and were astonished to see only tiny rivulets which were already shriveling out of sight in the gutters. In a few minutes there was no running water left, although the dampness on the walls and walks showed how great the humidity of the air had been. At the same time the oppression was...", "...with a keen mind and a love for banter that promised much enjoyment for the Overland Riders. \"I wonder who is the Henry that she mentioned?\" reflected Grace out loud. \"Perhaps Henry may be a tame goose. Think of 'June' and 'July' as names for mules,\" chortled Hippy. \"Oh, we're going to have a merry, merry time this coming two months--especially Hindenburg and myself.\" Afternoon tea was an enjoyable occasion that day, at which the principal topic was their new guide. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before six, after stamping out their little campfire, the Overland party started for the log cabin. As they crossed the road Hippy sniffed the air. \"I smell food!\" he cried. \"Onions! Save me!\" moaned Emma. \"No. It is something far and away ahead of mere onions,\" answered Hippy. \"I don't know what it is, but were this not so formal an occasion, I should break into a run for it.\" The door of the cabin stood open, so the party filed in unbidden.

These detonations are evidently due to the production of steam in the ducts which feed the geyser tube, which steam escaping into the cooler water of the tube is there suddenly condensed, and produces the explosions. Professor Bunsen succeeded in determining the temperature of the geyser tube, from top to bottom, a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before a great eruption; and these observations revealed the extraordinary fact that at no part of the tube did the water reach its boiling point. In the sketch [not reproduced] I have given on one side the temperatures actually observed, and on the other side the temperatures at which water would boil, taking into account both the pressure of the atmosphere and the pressure of the superincumbent column of water.

Attention should also be paid to the diet, and such indigestible articles as pork, pickles, rich pies and cakes, and rich sauces, sweetmeats and nuts should be avoided. For local treatment, the face should be washed each day in warm, soapy water, using the best Castile soap. Then with a sponge or wash cloth wash off this water with as hot water as can be borne. It is best to keep up this sponging with the hot water for at least five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in order that the face may become thoroughly steamed. The face should then be wiped dry and rubbed briskly for a few minutes. =Burns.=--Burns are likely to occur at any time in the household, and one should always know what to do promptly. The best treatment is to add a teaspoonful of ordinary baking-soda to a cupful of water. Saturate some cloths in this solution and lay them over or loosely bind them about the burned part. This will take out the pain and sting at once. As...", "...left the club. He turned into Fifth Avenue, journeying toward Twenty-third Street, and had walked about half the distance when he felt a touch upon his arm. Mr. O'Royster was in that condition when his mental senses acted more quickly than his physical senses. Bringing his eyes to bear upon the spot where he felt the touch, he made out the shape of a big, dirty hand, and following it and the arm above it, he presently ascertained that a man was close at his elbow. He spent several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> scrutinizing the man's face, and finally he said: \"Ah, I shee. Beg pawdon, dear boy, f'not 'bsherving you b'fore.

There was a certain constraint in his manner which I did not understand till afterwards. We went on through the gate, and across what had once been the demesne, but had been swept bare of trees, and was now divided between a meadow and a stable-yard, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we stood before the castle which was the scene of a romance very dear to Irish hearts. It is not really a castle, but merely a tall and ugly house, with three bays and a low terrace in front, and it is not very old, since it dates only from 1739, when it was built as the home of the Ffolliotts, a powerful English family into whose hands this whole neighbourhood had fallen. The Ffolliotts, of course, were Protestants, and Willy Reilly was a Catholic; but Helen Ffolliott was so...", "...s-skun out, over the back f-fence when we heard he was coming. Mr. Chick brought him,--to talk b-business with F- Father.\" The \"Hoppergrass,\" still sailing slowly, had drawn near the point of land at the entrance of the little bay. Mr. Snider, who had walked a few steps along the shore, stood near this point,-- watching us. We passed so near him that I could easily have hit him with a base-ball, if I had had one, and felt so inclined. It was curious to be so near a man who, five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> earlier, had been chasing me with a club. He was still clasping and unclasping his hands nervously, but he said nothing, and neither did we. After about half a minute he turned, and hurried through the trees in the direction of the house. \"I think I'll get some dry clothes,\" said I, starting toward the cabin. Then I stopped,--it occurred to me that there were some questions to be asked. Up to this moment I had been so glad to get away from Mr. Snider, and to find the boat...", "...side of the fire, and let them stew till clear; take them out carefully one at a time, and lay them in a china or earthen dish for use.

Take off the skin, and nearly all the fat, and fry them of a nice brown. Put the steaks into a stewpan, with good gravy enough to make a proper sauce to them, adding pepper and salt. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before they are done, thicken the gravy with a piece of butter rolled in flour. A little shalot, or ketchup, or both may be added. STEWED POTATOES. Half boil some potatoes, drain and peel them nicely, and cut them into neat pieces.

Numbers of very large ones are occasionally captured in this way. A species of Chinese nets is also used along the river's banks. They are about 16 feet square, suspended by bamboos from each corner, and let down like buckets into the water, and then after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> drawn up again. A piece of string, to which are attached portions of the white leaves of the cocoanut tree, is tied at short intervals along the ebb side of the net, which effectually prevents fish from going that way. A plan somewhat analogous is employed on a small scale for catching crabs. A net three feet square is supported at the four corners by two pieces of stick fastened crosswise. From the centre of these sticks where they cross is a string to pull it up by or let it...", "...son Vaughan on the subject. Roger Layton did not attempt to conceal the admiration he felt for Lettice Audley, and he would gladly have remained another day could he have found sufficient excuse. Duty had, however, always been his guiding star, and he accordingly the next morning at daybreak was ready to depart. He had taken leave of Mistress Audley and Lettice the night before, but when the morning came Lettice was in the parlour to serve him with breakfast, and he enjoyed some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of her society before her brothers made their appearance. They came down booted and spurred, prepared to accompany him part of the way. He promised not to spare his good steed; but even so, he could not hope to be back much within a fortnight, and soon after that time he expected that the _Rainbow_ would be ready for sea, and he thus could not remain more than a day at Mistress Audley's on his way to Plymouth. In the evening Vaughan and Gilbert returned home. As they...", "...their continuing misfortunes, and which was not lessened by the harmless patter of the rain-drops on the thatch over their heads. \"I hope a bear won't come along and knock our shelter down,\" remarked Hubert a few minutes after they lay down. There was no real apprehension in his tone, the first nervousness inseparable from sleeping in the remote woods of the Okefinokee having by this time disappeared even in his case. Ted stretched his limbs, yawned, and made no reply; but a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later he said: \"You remember Uncle Walter saying the night before he left for Washington that the experts thought the war would last about three years? If it does, we'll be about old enough to go in--if we volunteer, and I will.\" \"I wouldn't mind an old-fashioned war, with fighting in the open in the old way,\" said Hubert, after a moment's thought. \"But that hard and dirty trench fighting, the terrible big new cannon, the poison gas, and all the devilish doings of the...", "...mustang, his feet in the stirrups, before the pony realized what had happened. A reasonably sharp rowel, pressed into the pinto's side, brought him a good two feet clear of the ground. Then began a lively battle between the boy and the horse. \"Don't let him tread on the beast,\" shouted Walter. \"N-n-no danger of that,\" stammered Tad. It was a lively battle while it lasted, but Silver Face realized, as he had never done before, that he had met his master. After some twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of fight, in which the pinto made numerous futile attempts to climb the sheer side of the canyon at the imminent danger of toppling over backwards and crushing his master, the brute gave up. \"Now you hold him while I load on the beast,\" directed Tad, riding up. This called for more disturbance. Silver Face fought against taking a lion on his back. He drew the line at that. Just the same, after another lively scrimmage, Mr. Lion was loaded on, but no sooner had Tad swung...", "...field to the other. We all felt, however, that this was but a lull before the final burst of the storm. The losses in our Regiment had thus far been light, and our spirits ran high. We felt entire confidence that no force that the Southerners could bring against us could by direct assault break our line at any point. About one o'clock, the first shot was fired in the tremendous artillery duel that preceded the last desperate attempt to penetrate our center at Cemetery Ridge. In five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> three hundred guns were pouring into one another, their deadly showers of shot and shell, and making fearful havoc of every thing that was not sheltered. From our position in the woods we could see nothing of what was going on in other parts of the line; but the air above was filled with screaming shells, as they flew back and forth on their deadly errand. In some instances, shells from the Confederate batteries in front of the Second Corps would pass entirely over our lines,...", "...continued in spite of the repeated sounds of the distant firing. Two hours or more had elapsed, and still no word was brought them, nor had the chaplain returned. Eagerly the boys had talked over the possibilities of Levi being a spy, Dennis firmly contending that there was not \"spunk enough in the little spalpeen to do anything for himself.\" Noel, however, claimed that the former sutler was not without a form of courage of his own. \"There comes the chaplain,\" said Dennis, after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more had elapsed. \"From the look of him I think he has got something he would like to say to us.\" Nor was the young Irishman disappointed. When the chaplain entered the tent his face was beaming and his satisfaction over what he was about to say was so manifest that every one of the inmates was confident good news of some kind had been brought. \"We have just heard from Washington!\" said the chaplain eagerly. \"We sent a message to President Lincoln informing him just what...", "...yesterday noon south 81 degrees west, distance 111 miles; longitude by account from Shoal Cape 1 degree 45 minutes west. A strong tradewind at east-south-east with fair weather. This day we saw a number of water-snakes that were ringed yellow and black, and towards noon we passed a great deal of rock-weed. Though the weather was fair we were constantly shipping water, which kept two men always employed to bale the boat. Friday 5. At noon I observed in latitude 10 degrees 45 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> south; our course since yesterday west one quarter north, 108 miles; longitude made 3 degrees 35 minutes west.

An exchange of punts followed the scrimmage, and Boxer Hall got the ball. Her players began some good work, but Randall was ready for it. Several of the best men were tackled so hard, though not unfairly, that time had to be taken out for them to recover. Then Pinstock had to retire because of a twisted ankle, but, to offset this, Jerry Jackson was knocked out and Everet took his place. For a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> it seemed as if Boxer Hall was going up the field for another touch-down, but Randall braced in time. Then a sudden change appeared to come over Phil. He had been playing for all he was worth, but now he seemed a perfect whirlwind as he called snappily to his men to take the ball through. And they did it. Through holes torn first on one side between tackle and guard, or guard and center, and then on the other wing, Everet, Holly Cross or Kindlings butted their way. Phil varied...", "...they went, the unmistakable sound of an automatic pistol or pistols, then a police whistle shrieked, and P. C. Habit broke into a run in the direction of the sound, blowing his own whistle as he ran. He arrived to find three men, two undoubtedly dead on the ground, and the third, Mr. Farrington's unpicturesque figure, standing shivering in the doorway of his house, a police whistle at his lips, and his grey velvet dressing-gown flapping in a chill eastern wind. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later T. B. Smith arrived on the scene from his house, to find a crowd of respectable size, half the bedroom windows of Brakely Square occupied by the morbid and the curious, and the police ambulance already on the spot. \"Dead, sir,\" reported the constable. T. B. looked at the men on the ground. They were obviously foreigners. One was well, almost richly dressed; the other wore the shabby evening dress of a waiter, under the long ulster which covered him from neck to...", "...good Lord, and take 'em suddin!'\" \"And He did!\" cried the child. \"The good Lord did take 'em sudden, didn't He, Daddy Captain?\" \"He did, my child!\" said the old man, solemnly. \"They was all home, them that was goin', in ten minutes from the time I saw the ship.

His big feet were planted squarely, with the heels together and the toes turned out. His voice rang out clear and true, and he paused impressively as he made each point.

The fairest women in Georgia stood up and cheered. It was as if the orator had bewitched them.

In July came the fall of Robespierre, who wanted animal courage to play out the desperate game he had planned. I was the first who got the information, and in five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> it was known to all my fellow-prisoners. In a few days I was set at liberty. I parted with the author of the \"Rights of Man\" and the \"Age of Reason\" at the door of the prison, and never set eyes on him afterward. I flew to my residence in the Rue St. Honore.

Papa told us all about it five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago.\" It was as much as Belinda could do to support the clamorous felicitations of her sisters, especially the unmarried damsels, who were eager to exhibit themselves in the capacity of bridesmaids; but by-and-by, after dinner, the Curate's wife drew her sisters away from that shadowy window in which Edward Arundel and Belinda were sitting, and the lovers were left to themselves.

I stood looking at her. Strange to say, the more I admired her, the more beautiful I found her, the more rapidly I felt my desires subside. I do not know whether it was some magnetic influence or her silence and listlessness. I lay down on a sofa opposite the alcove, and the coldness of death settled on my soul.

He could not find him. \"Mr. George has gone out,\" said a clerk. \"Not two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago.\" \"I had better tell Maria, then,\" thought Isaac. \"He does not look fit to be left alone.\" Speeding up to Maria's sitting-room, he found her there, talking to Margery.

B._ Good morning, sir; we are well, I thank you. _Teach._ You are in good season this morning, and I am glad to see that you are. It is so much better to be before our time, than to be a little late.

She did not seem to like that either.\" \"Absurd!

From him Eva's wild-eyed glance leaped to the woman who was trying on hats before one of the many long mirrors. She was seated, and a saleswoman was exclaiming discreetly at her elbow. Eva turned sharply and encountered her own saleswoman returning, hat-laden. \"Not to-day,\" she...", "...Gate is an elevated enclosure, disconnected from all around, containing five headstones in a row, over the bodies of Ali Pacha, the rebel chief of Yanina, and his four sons. The fatal mark of death by the bowstring is conspicuous on the tombs, as a warning to rebels that they cannot escape the sure vengeance of the Porte. It was toward the sunset of a beautiful evening, and all Stamboul was out among the tombs. At dark we reached the Golden Horn, crossed over in a caique, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> were in Pera. The next day I took a caique at Tophana, and went up to the shipyards at the head of the Golden Horn to visit Mr. Rhodes, to whom I had a letter from a friend in Smyrna. Mr. Rhodes is a native of Long Island, but from his boyhood a resident of this city, and I take great pleasure in saying that he is an honour to our state and country. The reader will remember that, some years ago, Mr. Eckford, one of our most prominent citizens, under a pressure of public and...", "...the meantime, he was kept occupied at the wheel for Mayne changed his course as the trees rolled past, until the telegraph rang and the engines stopped. Then there was silence until he heard the splash of the anchor and the roar of running chain. As the _Rio Negro_ slowly swung round, the winches rattled and her boats were hoisted out.

In the middle of the dirty patio a fountain splashed in a broken marble basin, and it was dim, and by contrast cool, under the arcade where Kit sat among the crumbling pillars. The presidio was a...", "...very long, they were home and as busy as could be getting everything ready for the big party. At eight o'clock, and maybe a few minutes before, the little front gate began to rattle, and Mother Goose came up the walk, followed by Goosey-Goosey-Gander and the Three Blind Mice, who held on to the gander's tail feathers so as not to stub their toes on the front door step. Then pretty soon, the lock began to rattle again, and in came Jack Sprite and the little Forest Fay, and before 13 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past 8 every one was there. Well, by and by it came time to cut the big birthday cake in which was hidden a little gold ring, and of course everyone hoped he would find it in his piece of cake. But of course everybody except Benjamin Meadow Mouse was disappointed, which tells you right away who got the ring.

I don't know why.\" Donal hastened home, and found himself eagerly expected, for the letter young Eppy had brought was from the earl. It informed Donal that it would give his lordship pleasure to see him, if he would favour him with a call. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he was again on the road to the castle. CHAPTER XI. THE EARL. He met no one on his way from the gate up through the wood. He ascended the hill with its dark ascending firs, to its crown of silvery birches, above which, as often as the slowly circling road brought him to the other side, he saw rise like a helmet the gray mass of the fortress. Turret and tower, pinnacle and battlement, appeared and disappeared as he climbed. Not until at last he stood almost on...", "...His visitors saw year after year the best proof of a good master in the familiar faces of those by whom he was served. As everything was done at its appointed time, there was no need for a bell to be rung. His meals, his medicine, everything was brought to the exact minute. No one was summoned, for no one was ever late. In the days when he was still strong enough to drive out, he had been often troubled by the unpunctuality of his coachman:-- \"I advised him to _aim_ at being five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before the appointed time. Of course I only _advised_ this--to have ordered it would merely have changed the appointed hour. Just as the allowance of five minutes' grace at the Post Office simply alters the hour of attendance from 10.0 to 10.5 a.m., and does nothing to secure punctuality. \"Still the result was unsatisfactory, and I was irritated and annoyed by the man's persistence. He was honest and sober, and had a wife and several children....", "...to the Huguenots against the Catholics, according as political exigencies dictated.

I therefore set up one last long final howl, to let my senior know that I was present, and then immediately became absent. I hastened to the bazaar, and purchasing here and there--at one place a vest, at another a shawl, and at another a turban--I threw off my dress of a dervish, hastened to the bath, and after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> under the barber, came out like a butterfly from its dark shell. No one would have recognised in the spruce young Turk, the filthy dervish. I hastened to Constantinople, where I lived gaily, and spent my money; but I found that to mix in the world, it is necessary not only to have an attaghan, but also to have the courage to use it; and in several broils which took place, from my too frequent use of the water of the Giaour, I invariably proved, that although my voice was that...", "...knew that all the audience were applauding. But Dennis had little time for musing, so great was the strain upon him to prevent confusion. His voice excited great surprise and applause, many inquiring vainly who he was. When he and Christine sung together the audience were perfectly carried away, and stormed and applauded without stint. Indeed, it seemed that they could not be satisfied. The call was so urgent that several asked Christine to sing again, and she did so alone. For ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she held the audience perfectly entranced, and no one more so than Dennis. Usually she was too cold in all that she did, but now in her excitement she far surpassed herself, and he acknowledged that he had never heard such music before. The very soul of song seemed breathed into her, and every nook and corner of the house appeared to vibrate with melody. Even the servants in distant rooms said that it seemed that an angel was singing. After she ceased, the audience sat...", "...have their part alike in the illumining and warming of the room. As the fire purrs and softly crackles, so does my lamp at intervals utter a little gurgling sound when the oil flows to the wick, and custom has made this a pleasure to me. Another sound, blending with both, is the gentle ticking of the clock. I could not endure one of those bustling little clocks which tick like a fever pulse, and are only fit for a stockbroker's office; mine hums very slowly, as though it savoured the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> no less than I do; and when it strikes, the little voice is silver-sweet, telling me without sadness that another hour of life is reckoned, another of the priceless hours-- \"Quae nobis pereunt et imputantur.\" After extinguishing the lamp, and when I have reached the door, I always turn to look back; my room is so cosily alluring in the light of the last gleeds, that I do not easily move away. The warm glow is reflected on shining wood, on my chair, my writing-table, on...", "...Malcolm wandered from window to window watching attentively what was going on without, but keeping himself as far back as possible from the loopholes; for the men with muskets kept up a dropping fire at the openings, and although their aim was poor, bullets occasionally passed in and flattened themselves against the opposite walls. \"There is a man returning,\" he said in about half an hour; \"he is carrying something on his shoulder, but I cannot see what it is.\" In another ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the man had reached the group of peasants standing two or three hundred yards from the church, and was greeted with cheers and waving of hats. \"Good heavens!\" Malcolm exclaimed suddenly, \"it is a barrel of powder. They must have stripped some broken down ammunition wagon. This is a danger indeed.\" The men grasped their weapons and rose to their feet at the news, prepared to take any steps which their young officer might command, for his promptitude and ingenuity had...", "...solution dawned upon him, and he crept up, still in the shadow, to below where the Turk was standing, and whistled softly. Then a voice from above said: \"You are late. Here is the paper signed,\" and a white thing fluttered down. This done, the Turk turned, and, without waiting for a reply, went southward down the wall. The paper, whatever it was, was in Mitsos' possession, and putting it in his pocket, for it was too dark to read it, he crept back to his old place to wait a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more there before going back to the camp. Lights showed only in one house now, and before long they, too, were quenched, and the black mass of flat roofs rose against the sky silent and asleep. Then suddenly and softly from out that blackness, like a bird flying in the desert, came the sound of a voice singing, and at those notes Mitsos thought his heart would have burst. For it sang: \"Dig we deep among the vines, Give the sweet spring showers a home, Else the...", "...Cotton gone?\" At this moment a window opened, and a handsome young man in a very splendid uniform looked out of it. \"Halloa, Murray!\" said he. \"These cursed papers keep me, but I will be at your heels.\" \"Very good, Cotton. I am late already, so I will ride on.\" \"You might order my groom to bring round my horse,\" said the young general at the window to the orderly below, while the other went on down the road. The orderly rode away to some outlying stable, and then in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> there came a smart English groom with a cockade in his hat, leading by the bridle a horse--and, oh, my friends, you have never known the perfection to which a horse can attain until you have seen a first-class English hunter. He was superb: tall, broad, strong, and yet as graceful and agile as a deer. Coal black he was in colour, and his neck, and his shoulder, and his quarters, and his fetlocks--how can I describe him all to you? The sun shone upon him as on polished ebony,...", "...had been eliminated and now a vast pool was being formed to support the market and kindly hold the securities until the people could get their breath and make money enough to buy them back at a profit. In due time he knew that his name would be enrolled with the king's as a patriot and public benefactor. Bivens lingered a moment as if reluctant to give up dissuading Stuart, waved him a friendly adieu at last, stepped into the elevator and left by the roof. It was yet fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to ten, the hour for opening the bank's doors, and Stuart decided to address the crowd immediately. In accordance with Bivens's instructions the cashier opened the bronze doors and squeezed through, admitting Stuart and two detectives. At the sight of the cashier a thrill of horror swept the crowd--half-groan, half-sigh, half-cry, inarticulate, inhuman, beastly in its grovelling fear. \"Great God!\" \"They're going to suspend!\" \"It's all over!\" The groans melted into...", "...was full of excitement over the German successes on sea and on land. \"On land?\" said Raeder. \"Well, I should not radiate too freely about their land successes. What about the Marne?\" \"The Marne!\" said Schaefer in hot contempt. \"The Marne--strategy--strategy, my dear sir. But wait. Wait a few days. If we could only get that boasted British navy to venture out from their holes, then the war would be over. Mark what happens in the Pacific.

The only efforts that the Kaiser has made for the last few years are efforts to bully Europe into submission to his will. The great peace-maker of...", "...how to keep her head in an emergency. Olga looked at Nick. \"I should wait if I were you,\" he counselled. \"She is sure to want you later on.\" She nodded silently, and bent over Cork. The strain of the past few hours was beginning to tell upon her. Her tears fell unrestrained upon the great dog's head. Nick strolled away to the head of the stairs, and stood there like a sentinel, searching the blurred expanse of sea through the open window with alert, restless eyes. Several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed; then there came the sound of the key turning in the lock. Olga stood up hastily, dashing away her tears. Mrs. Briggs's head appeared in the aperture. \"Miss Olga,\" she said in a strenuous whisper, \"Miss Violet would like to speak to you if so be as you're alone. But she won't have anyone else.\" \"There is only Captain Ratcliffe here,\" said Olga. \"Then p'raps he'll be good enough to wait outside,\" said Mrs. Briggs, with the air of a general issuing his orders. \"You...", "...\"I'd do it, just the same!\" said Anna, \"and I wouldn't have the nurse standing around, either--and yet, I suppose that's not very reasonable,\" she went on, after a moment's thought, \"for that's Conrad's free time.

Peppino mounted the seat behind. \"Will your excellency visit St. Peter's?\" asked the cicerone. \"I did not come to Rome to see,\" said Danglars aloud; then he added softly, with an avaricious smile, \"I came to touch!\" and he rapped his pocket-book, in which he had just placed a letter. \"Then your excellency is going\"-- \"To the hotel.\" \"Casa Pastrini!\" said the cicerone to the coachman, and the carriage drove rapidly on. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards the baron entered his apartment, and Peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel, after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of Marius and the Gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter, who immediately ran down the road leading to the Capitol at his fullest speed. Danglars was tired and sleepy; he therefore went to bed, placing his pocketbook under his pillow. Peppino had a little spare time, so he had...", "...we judged, from its gaping walls, that it was the remains of a church steeple. It was the dominating ruin in the town of Beaumont. \"Turn here to the left,\" the officer conducting our party whispered into the ear of the driver. The sudden execution of the command caused the officer's helmet to rasp against that of the driver with a sound that set the cautious whispering to naught. \"Park here in the shadow,\" he continued. \"Make no noise; show no light.

We seemed to be following a gentle curve round the dome, with the rock upon our left hand, and the valley three thousand feet down upon our right. There was nothing to tell us of the danger trap; and, thinking he had a clear road, Ferdinand opened his throttle and we shot ahead like a shell from a gun. Less than a second afterwards I had made a wild leap from my seat--and Ferdinand, without a cry or a sound, had gone headlong to the valley below. I suppose five good <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> must have passed before I knew anything at all, either of the nature of this awful accident or of the good luck which attended my leap. Lying there on my back, I became conscious presently that I was in a thick scrub of gorse, which lined the road hereabouts. It had caught me just as a spider's web catches a fly. I ached intolerably, that is true--my whole body seemed numbed, as though it had been hit with irons, while my leather clothes were torn to rags. But, by-and-by, it...", "...and yet they would arrive at the rendezvous at practically the same time! On one of these occasions the horses were taken to the little River Auja[12] two miles north of the camp, and made to swim across, attached to an endless rope, being afterwards followed by the men.

It arrived at the point three miles away, in full marching order within 40 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> from the time the order was received. On May 28th, the Brigade moved forward north of the Auja, in reserve for the attack by the 7th Indian Division, but this movement was merely intended to capture a few enemy posts in order to narrow \"no man's land,\" and thus bring ourselves into closer touch with the enemy.

Dr. Percival and his half brother, Robert Johnson, had been spending some months together in Europe, their sister Betty visiting friends in Natchez through the winter, and only that morning the three had returned to Magnolia Hall, where Betty had a home with her sister Molly, and the brothers were always welcome guests. Presently all were seated and a very animated conversation ensued, the newly arrived having much to...", "...however, wearying of the fruitless contest, he roared out, 'I wish I were safe in my boat in the bay,' and almost instantaneously he found himself in the little skiff, which was stranded high and dry upon the Poulton beach.

It made everything quite easy. She shut the book--the sinister old book which had given her so awful a shock. Why not go up and see Jane now--at once? It was still early, not much after midnight. Athena glanced at the tiny clock which had played its little part just before Jane's arrival at Rede Place in provoking Hew Lingard's avowal of--of weakness. Yes, it was only ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past twelve. Jane was probably wide awake still. Athena went to the library and carefully put back the volume in its place among the other legal books which had belonged to Wantele's father.

Young Farrar had been the champion runner of his school, and he blessed his trained legs for giving him a prominent part in the wild chase that followed.

In two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> every camper, in his stocking feet, just as he had risen from his bed, was tearing across the _brulee_ in the wake of Bruin, yelling, leaping, and swinging smouldering firebrands.

The black drapery, the decapitated victim, the stream of blood which had inundated the platform, all had disappeared with the...", "...business. Don't ask me.\"(303) Obstruction was freely practised and without remorse. The chief fighting debater against the government made a long second-reading speech, on the motion that the clause stand part of the bill. A little before eight o'clock when the fighting debater was winding up, Mr. Gladstone was undecided about speaking. \"What do you advise?\" he asked of a friend. \"I am afraid it will take too much out of you,\" the friend replied; \"but still, speak for twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and no more.\" Up he rose, and for half an hour a delighted House was treated to one of the most remarkable performances that ever was known. \"I have never seen Mr. Gladstone,\" says one observer, \"so dramatic, so prolific of all the resources of the actor's art. The courage, the audacity, and the melodrama of it were irresistible\" (May 11). For ten minutes, writes another chronicler, Mr. Gladstone spoke, holding his audience spell-bound by his force. Then came a...", "...windows.\" \"It's very fine to be so calm and collected, M. Mauperin, very fine--very fine indeed,\" said Mme. Bourjot, and her low, hissing voice sounded choked. Some clouds that were moving quickly along in the sky passed like the wings of night-birds over the moon, and Mme. Bourjot gazed blankly into the darkness in front of her. With her elbows resting on her knees and supported by her high heels, she remained silent, tapping the gravel path with her satin slippers. After a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she sat up, moved her arms about in an unconscious way as though she were scarcely awake, then quickly, and in a jerky way, she put her hand between her dress and waistband, pressing the back of her hand against the ribbon as though she were going to burst it. Finally she rose and began to walk, followed by Henri. \"I count on our never seeing each other again, monsieur,\" she said, without turning round. As she passed by the fountain she handed him her handkerchief,...", "...\"It is very simple. Five minutes ago his father sailed by. You made a remark about him. The remark suggested a train of thought which landed you at the racecourse where you saw, or intimated that you saw, the steeplestakes. But what visible sweepstakes are there except M. P.'s son? You and M. P. are friends. It is only natural that you should ask about him.\" Verelst turned uneasily. \"I don't yet see how you got it.

If he does not bring it back, when can we get another bucket?\" And so on, until Talbot would pacify her, promising her that the bucket would be returned. Then he would go on to the Colonel, breathless and perturbed, his mind so full of buckets that there was hardly room for the business of the Tank Corps. Small wonder that the sight of a...", "...that she was following him up, and convince her it was not he who was the suspected party, was, Austin thought, needful--that is, if he could do it. However, he could only obey Mr. Hunter's suggestions. Austin resumed his occupation. His brain and fingers were busy over the plan, when he saw a gig drive into the yard. It contained the great engineer, Sir Michael Wilson. Mr. Henry Hunter came down the yard to meet him; they shook hands, and entered the private room together.

The child was deformed. I was awfully cut up about it at the time, but it's all over now.' The conversation then came to a pause. Kate did not like to ask any further questions, but as she stared vaguely at the pale sun setting, she wondered what the acrobat was like, and how a girl could prefer a gutta-percha man to the musician.

Without a moment's hesitation they promptly covered Bonaparte, much to the delight of that genius.

In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterward the cannonading became very furious, and the Frenchmen who were on board began to show strong signs of uneasiness. The fact was, that a French squadron, of one sixty-gun ship and two corvettes, had been on the look-out for the convoy, and had come in among them during the fog.

The sound of voices and laughter reached their ears as they ascended the stairs, and when they entered the drawing-room they found a number of people there before them. There was...", "...or to taste 2 teaspoons ground pepper 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1/2 cup water Cut chicken breasts into 1-inch cubes.

David kept the envelope, sipped his milk, and for some time talked with Mrs. Carter about her cows, her fruit, and whether the white calf was to be sold or kept. When it was ten minutes to eight by the big parlor clock he rose to go, said that he hoped to see baby next time, if he might call again, and shook hands. But in going out, from force of habit, he glanced at his watch, and now saw that it was really ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past eight. \"Great goodness!\" he exclaimed, \"your clock is all wrong!\" \"No, sir--\" began Mrs. Carter. David was gone. He had five minutes in which to run a good deal over a mile, and he ran with all his speed; but some distance from the station he saw the train steaming out, and pulled up short. At that moment Van Hupfeldt in the train was thinking: \"It has worked well. He is late, and there is no other train till ten--an hour and three quarters. He has only a...", "...of St. George and St. Matthew the birds are very common, and from one to a dozen are in almost constant attendance upon the visitor. They sight him from afar and fly to meet him. Some bird will almost always try to lead him astray. If followed, it flies from knoll to knoll, often not more than 20 yards away. It remains in front of the visitor regardless of the direction he may take; whether toward or from the nest, makes no difference. After several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of this a sudden flight, with the familiar \"song,\" is taken to some distant hill and the searcher for a nest is left confused and confounded. A search for the nest will exhaust the patience of any except the most persistent collector. Messrs.

The driver was first used in forming the great steam dock at Devonport, where the results were very striking; and it was shortly after employed by Robert Stephenson in piling the foundations of the great High Level Bridge at Newcastle, and the Border Bridge at Berwick, as well as in several other of his great works. The saving of time effected by this machine was very remarkable, the ratio being as 1 to 1800; that is, a pile could be driven in four <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> that before required twelve hours. One of the peculiar features of the invention was that of employing the pile itself as the support of the steam-hammer part of the apparatus while it was being driven, so that the pile had the percussive action of the dead weight of the hammer as well as its lively blows to induce it to sink into the ground. The steam-hammer sat as it were on the shoulders of the pile, while it dealt forth its ponderous blows on the pile-head at the rate of...", "...on saying, \"No, thanks, Mrs. Smith; no, thanks, Miss Smith; I really couldn't; I've done very well, thank you; I had a very late dinner, and so on\"--bother such tommy-rot.

And you think of the days out on the track when you and Tom sat on your swags under a mulga at mid-day, and ate mutton and johnny-cake with clasp-knives, and drank by turns out of the old, battered, leaky billy. And after tea you have to sit still while the precious <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> are wasted, and listen and sympathize, while all the time you are on the fidget to get out with Tom, and go down to a private bar where you know some girls. And perhaps by-and-bye the old lady gets confidential, and seizes an opportunity to tell you what a good steady young fellow Tom is now that he never touches drink, and belongs to a temperance society (or the Y.M.C.A.), and never stays out of nights. Consequently you feel worse than ever, and lonelier, and sorrier...", "...as if by something almost austere in the grace of her authority, the semi-scared (now that they were there!) knot of her visitors, who, since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearning to inquire and admire, saw themselves restricted to this consistency.

In two minutes I followed his example, after ascertaining that the unfortunate d'Ache no longer breathed. I was in a state of amazement.

He pulled it out and says he: 'Why, Sam, what's your Sunday necktie doin' up your pants leg?' \"They said Sam looked at it in a foolish sort o' way and then he fell back laughin' and cryin' at the same time, jest like a woman, and it was five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or more before they could stop him.

The two men shook hands. Contraras grumbled a little. \"My friend, punctuality was never your very special virtue. You were to be at my house by a quarter-past six. It is now a quarter to seven, half an hour late, and I am meeting you at the station. It would take another five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to get to my house.\" \"That would mean I should be quite thirty-five minutes late, eh?\" queried Lucue in his usual easy, genial fashion. He had the greatest respect for the great leader, Ferdinand Contraras; he fully recognised his single-mindedness, his devotion to the cause. But he was also aware of his little weaknesses of temper, his proneness to take offence at trifles. \"I am honestly very sorry I have kept you waiting, but it was impossible to get away before.\"...", "...so large a quantity of spirit; it usually abounds in mucilage; hence it becomes turbid when mixed with alcohol. Such beer cannot keep, without becoming sour. It has been matter of frequent complaint, that ALL the porter now brewed, is not what porter was formerly. This idea may be true with some exceptions. My professional occupations have, during these twenty-eight years, repeatedly obliged me to examine the strength of London porter, brewed by different brewers; and, from the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> made on that subject, I am authorised to state, that the porter now brewed by the eminent London brewers, is unquestionably stronger than that which was brewed at different periods during the late French war.

He told her of the racehorse Elodie and his lucky inspiration. For the first time she laughed and clapped her hands. \"Oh, I am flattered! Yes, and greatly touched.

By dint of questioning she learned most of his not over-eventful history. He told her of Horatio Bakkus, and of the season on the sands, when first he realized her original idea of exploiting his figure; of Prepimpin in his prime and their wanderings about Europe. And now alas! there was no longer a...", "...\"Yes,\" said I. \"Thank God!\" he cried, and dropped into a chair. \"This is no place for children,\" he said severely, \"and I have come to take her home.

I blurted out a gruff \"All right,\" and turned on my heel, unable to face the derisive smile upon the thin, pale lips. As I walked towards the house, I heard Ajax following me, but he did not speak till we had reached our comfortable sitting-room. Then, as gruffly as I, he said, \"Humpty Dumpty--after the fall!\" We lit our pipes in silence, sensible of an extraordinary depression in the moral atmosphere. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before we had been much elated. The spring round-up of cattle was over; we had sold our bunch of steers at the top price; the money lay in our small safe; we had been talking of a modest celebration as we rode home over the foothills. Now, to use the metaphor of a cow county, we had been brought up with a sharp turn! Our prosperity, measured by the ill-fortune of a fellow- countryman, dwindled. Ajax summed up the situation: \"He made me feel cheap.\" \"Why?\" I asked, conscious...", "...long and gloomy aisles. The ruined cabin, patched and covered with pine boughs, was set apart for the ladies. As the lovers parted, they unaffectedly exchanged a kiss, so honest and sincere that it might have been heard above the swaying pines. The frail Duchess and the malevolent Mother Shipton were probably too stunned to remark upon this last evidence of simplicity, and so turned without a word to the hut. The fire was replenished, the men lay down before the door, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> were asleep. Mr. Oakhurst was a light sleeper. Toward morning he awoke benumbed and cold. As he stirred the dying fire, the wind, which was now blowing strongly, brought to his cheek that which caused the blood to leave it,--snow! He started to his feet with the intention of awakening the sleepers, for there was no time to lose. But turning to where Uncle Billy had been lying, he found him gone. A suspicion leaped to his brain and a curse to his lips. He ran to the spot...", "...rain and the angry heavens soon drowned the last echoes of the receding hoofclang. For myself, I looked in vain for a tree; not even a shrub was to be found; the fields lay bare on either side, with no other partition but a dead hedge, and a deep dyke. \"Patientia fit melius,\" thought I, as Horace said, and Vincent would say; and in order to divert my thoughts from my situation, I turned them towards my diplomatic success with Lord Chester. Presently, for I think scarcely five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had elapsed since Tyrrell's departure, a horseman passed me at a sharp pace; the moon was hid by the dense cloud, and the night, though not wholly dark, was dim and obscured, so that I could only catch the outline of the flitting figure. A thrill of fear crept over me, when I saw that it was enveloped in a horseman's cloak. I soon rallied--\"There are more cloaks in the world than one,\" said I to myself; \"besides, even if it be Tyrrell's dodger, as he calls him, the baronet is...", "...the same thing.\" \"Wha-wha-what's that? Have you got more big cousins?\" cried Peter, staring up at Jenny as if she were some strange person he never had seen before. \"Certainly,\" retorted Jenny. \"Mocker the Mockingbird and Kitty the Catbird belong to Brownie's family, and that makes them second cousins to me.\" Such a funny expression as there was on Peter's face. He felt that Jenny Wren was telling the truth, but it was surprising news to him and so hard to believe that for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he couldn't find his tongue to ask another question. Finally he ventured to ask very timidly, \"Does Brownie imitate the songs of other birds the way Mocker and Kitty do?\" Jenny Wren shook her head very decidedly. \"No,\" said she. \"He's perfectly satisfied with his own song.\" Before she could add anything further the clear whistle of Glory the Cardinal sounded from a tree just a little way off. Instantly Peter forgot all about Jenny Wren's relatives and scampered over to that...", "...enough to take away all our appetite, although Carolus and Johannes, who by this time had recovered somewhat from the shock of that night of blood and terror, ate in a fashion which might have filled Hans himself with envy. Shortly after we had finished our meal, Hans, who, by the way, seemed to have quite recovered from his fatigues, came to remove the dishes. He informed us that all the Boers were having a great \"talk,\" and that they were about to send for me. Sure enough, a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later two armed men arrived and ordered me to follow them. I turned to say some words of farewell to Marie, but she said: \"I go where you do, husband,\" and, as no objection was made by the guard, she came. About two hundred yards away, sitting under the shade of one of the wagons, we found the Boers. Six of them were seated in a semicircle upon stools or whatever they could find, the black-browed commandant being in the centre and having in front of him a rough table on...", "...partly closed the door, and gazed at the lady through a little crack.\" \"I do not know about that,\" said the Mistress of the House; \"he should have gone in boldly.\" \"Excuse me,\" said John Gayther, \"but I think not.

This was the name of the girl now in waiting, as it had been the name of her mother, and she instantly appeared from the adjoining room. She had seen all that had happened, and was trembling so much she could scarcely stand; but she was a girl of nerve, and approached and stood by her mistress.

He dressed slowly and carefully, with a due consciousness of the relation between appearance and personality, and descended the stairs at five minutes to nine.

By the door stood Crandell, the footman who had served his uncle, and who regarded the advent of the young master with satisfaction. For five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Rex waited, and the carriage wheels shrieked on the gravel as the driver wheeled his horses sharply in front of the great arched entrance. A silver-chimed clock pealed nine in the drawing-room, and the soft rustle of Mercia's garments sounded on the stairway. Britton looked up involuntarily, his face flushing slightly. His wife's beauty was a revelation to which no man could deny homage; she carried herself with distinction enhanced by a peculiar, free rhythm of movement...", "...place o' these cold-'lasses mules, an' danged if hyar they ain't, saddles an' all, right under our noses.\" While he went along the back trail on foot to a point from where he could see the river, his companions became busy.

No, for in high altitudes things appeared closer on account of the clarity of the air than they did at sea level. Six <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed, still no answer had come to Jim, yet he was perfectly calm and contained as though he were the perfection of wisdom. He folded his arms across his chest and regarded Tom serenely as he sat on the opposite side of the deck on a coil of rope, regarding his big brother skeptically.

He was quite as conscious of all that was urged in Mr. Parnell's letter as was its writer, but perception of risks on one side did not overcome risks on the other. The same evening they met...", "...* * * * It was two a.m. before Senator Vance Duran wearily dropped into bed. But he found no rest in sleep that night. For in his dreams he seemed to see a youngster walking, now through a forest, now through a city, now through an autumn countryside. And in the boy's hand was a tightly capped bottle. And the expression on his face was an enigma.... Early the next morning Jack Woodvale parked the helicopter in a lot back of the city youth detention home. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the senator was again talking to his older son. \"I have to get back to Washington this morning, Roger,\" he said. \"I've scheduled a committee meeting for ten-thirty. I suppose I could call it off, but we've got to do something about the Mars colony project before public apathy forces us to drop the whole thing. You understand, don't you?\" \"Sure,\" the boy said with apparent indifference. \"Maybe you should have let _me_ volunteer. You'd have solved two problems at the...", "...the first boat.' Gustavo bowed to the inevitable; and the young man passed on. He paused half-way across the courtyard. 'What time does the first boat leave?' 'At half-past five, signore.' 'Er--no--I'll take the second.' '_Si_, signore. At half-past ten.' CHAPTER III It was close upon ten when Jerymn Hilliard, Jr., equipped for travel in proper blue serge, appeared in the doorway of the Hotel du Lac. He looked at his watch and discovered that he still had twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before the omnibus meeting the second boat was due. He strolled across the courtyard, paused for a moment to tease the parrot, and sauntered on to his favourite seat in the summer-house. He had barely established himself with a cigarette when who should appear in the gateway but Miss Constance Wilder, of Villa Rosa, and a middle-aged man--at a glance the Signor Papa. Jerymn Hilliard's heart doubled its beat. Why, he asked himself excitedly, _why_ had they come? The Signor...", "...his towels and soap with him to a little rocky pool in the stream where he was wont to indulge in his morning's \"tub;\" and by eight o'clock he was seated at table in his tent, enjoying his breakfast, and at the same time keeping an eye upon the barque. It was not, however, until close upon half-past ten that Dick detected any signs of a movement on board the _Minerva_; and then with the aid of his telescope, he observed that they were getting the vessel's dinghy into the water. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later he saw Turnbull climb down the ship's side, and, throwing over a short pair of sculls, shove off and head the little craft for the beach. Dick waited only just long enough to make quite sure that the man was really coming ashore, and, this presently becoming evident, he at once started for the treasure-cave. Knowing the way by this time perfectly well, an hour's easy walking took him to the spot, where he found Nicholls and Simpson on the watch. A few terse sentences...", "...us consider this cavern as a rich monastery; such, alas! as existed in the good days of old, when the larder and refectory were a credit to religion and a relief to the destitute, but which, alas!--and alas! again--we can only think of as a--in the meantime, I can stand this no longer. If I possess judgment or penetration in _re culinaria_, I am of opinion,\" he added (stirring up the contents of it), \"that it is fit to be operated on; so, in God's name, let us have at it.\" In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> two or three immense pewter dishes were heaped with a stew made up of mutton, bacon, hung beef, onions, and potatoes, forming indeed a most delicious mess for any man, much less the miserable men who were making it disappear so rapidly. Reilly, the very picture of health, after maintaining a pace inferior to that of none, although there were decidedly some handy workmen there, now was forced to pull up and halt. In the meantime some slow but steady operations went on with a...", "...white hood. I guessed that there was an old bank under this one. I took a stake from the sled, dropped on my hands and knees and began to poke about for it. I soon found it, broke through the frozen crust with the stake and began pawing out a burrow with my hands. I dug like a scared badger and in a few minutes had a place big enough. I wriggled out, pushed Kaiser in, took the blanket from the sled, backed into my snow cave again and rolled up as best I could in the blanket. In five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the mouth of the burrow was drifted over and we were in total darkness. I was not afraid to sleep now, as I knew, what with the snow, my big coat, and the blanket, not to mention Kaiser, I would be safe enough from freezing; so that is what I did till morning, scarce waking once. When I did wake, though I knew no more than anything if it were morning, I could no longer hear the wind roaring, so I burrowed out; which was no small job, either, since I had to dig through a wall...", "...18 eggs, allspice and orange to your taste, or fennel, carroway or coriander seeds; put to 9 pounds of flour, 3 pints emptins, and bake well. _Cookies_.

A foot at a time she passed out, then headed toward the bear dens. Midway, we steered her in among some young maple trees, and soon had her front legs chained to one of them. Alice tried to push it over, and came near to doing so. Then we quickly tied her hind legs together,--and she was all ours. Seeing that all was clear for a fall, we joyously pushed Alice off her feet. She went over, and fell prone upon her side. In three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> all her feet were securely anchored to trees, and we sat down upon her prostrate body. At that crowning indignity Alice was the maddest elephant in the world for that day. We gave her food, and the use of her trunk, and left her there twenty-four hours, to think it over. She deserved a vast beating with canes; but we gave her no punishment whatever. It would have served no good purpose. During the interval we telephoned to Coney Island, and asked Dick Richards, the former...", "...my chief, with a quick gesture of approval. \"We seem to be losing ground day by day. Why? At all costs the position must be retrieved. You will want Madame Soyez to help you. Let me see; she is at present in England. I sent her across only a week ago to make some inquiries. Excuse me a moment while I speak to Guillet,\" and he left me to go to the telephone. Monsieur Guillet was his private secretary, who controlled his \"financial office\" in the Boulevard des Capucines. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later he returned, saying: \"Madame is to-day at the Midland Grand Hotel in Manchester. Presuming that you wish to meet her, I have told Guillet to telegraph, asking her, if possible, to meet you to-morrow night in London.\" \"No,\" I said at once. \"That won't do.

Then we will begin to probe matters across the Channel. Recall...", "...sauce ten minutes. Salt, and serve. PROTOSE FRICASSEE Tomatoes, 1 cup. Minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful. Protose, 1 pound.

I put a sign in the window saying: \"Why pay fifty cents a pound for Milton's tea, when you can buy it here for thirty-eight cents a pound, nineteen cents the half pound.\" That was exactly what it cost us. Martin had got hold of it for us from a friend of his in Providence, who was a wholesale grocer. You really would have laughed to see Purkes come flying into our store about fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after our window trim was complete. He reminded me of a wet hen who had had her tail feathers pulled out. He couldn't speak, he just sputtered and pointed to the window. After a minute I caught the words, \"Scoundrel!\" and \"robber!\" and \"unjust!\" and \"report to the Merchants' Association!\" I turned around and caught sight of Charlie grinning his head off. He passed the high sign to me, which I understood to mean \"Let him talk.\" So I beckoned to Charlie to come over. \"This...", "...A sharp pain shot through the young cadet's head, he reeled and all became dark before him. With a faint moan he fell senseless into the bottom of his boat. The contest had been short, and well it was for the Spaniards that such was the case. Already the flickering of the searchlight told that the flagship was hurrying to the scene. The Spaniards realized the importance of quick action. They had, on the impulse of the moment, retaliated upon Clif because it could take but a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and because they felt that the chase would end not far from their waiting vessel. They congratulated themselves that it had, indeed, brought them almost to the ship's side, and now they lost no time in getting themselves and their prisoner aboard. Willing hands assisted from above. A couple of strokes of the oars had brought them to the ship's side, with Clif's boat in tow. In obedience to a command, Clif's boat with its unconscious burden was raised bodily to the deck. The...", "...they began to wonder what that old rogue my uncle could mean by sending a gentleman to town without money; and when they gave me what I asked for, advised me to stipulate for more regular remittances. 15. This somewhat disturbed my dream of constant affluence, but I was three days after completely awaked; for entering the tavern, where we met every evening, I found the waiters remitted their complaisance, and instead of contending to light me up stairs, suffered me to wait for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> by the bar. 16. When I came to my company I found them unusually grave and formal, and one of them took a hint to turn the conversation upon the misconduct of young men, and enlarged upon the folly of frequenting the company of men of fortune, without being able to support the expence; an observation which the rest contributed either to enforce by repetition, or to illustrate by examples. Only one of them tried to divert the discourse, and endeavoured to direct my attention...", "...napkin and cover the cut surface of the fish with salad oil.

Very unprofessional to have them here, eh?\" \"You play, then?\" said Glyddyr, repeating the doctor's query. \"Not often. No one to play with. A game now and then would do you good.\" \"Yes, yes,\" said Glyddyr, eagerly. \"Come on board. I'm very dull there.\" \"Most happy if you'll have a game here sometimes.\" Glyddyr accepted the proposal so readily that in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they were seated together at piquet, and when the patient rose he was ten pounds in the doctor's debt. \"I shall have to give you my IOU, doctor,\" said Glyddyr, \"I have no cash down here.\" \"All right, my dear sir,\" said the doctor, smilingly; and Glyddyr wrote the indebtedness upon half a sheet of notepaper, to go away feeling better for his visit, and after the doctor had promised to go on board the yacht that night and give him his revenge. This was given, Glyddyr...", "...nonsense, I tell you. Allie's got to come, too. She's not such a fool as you think. Bad example--bosh!\" Anita started up. \"Oh--please--please!\" she cried. \"Take me away--anywhere! This is dreadful.\" It was, indeed, dreadful. If I could have had my way at just that moment, it would have gone hard with \"Mrs. B.\" and \"Allie\"--and heavy-voiced Joe, too. But I hid my feelings. \"There's nowhere else to go,\" said I, \"except the brougham.\" She sank helplessly into her chair. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more of silence, and there was a rustling on the stairs. She started up, trembling, looked round, as if seeking some way of escape or some place to hide. Joe was in the doorway holding aside one of the curtains. There entered, in a beribboned and beflounced tea gown, a pretty, if rather ordinary, woman of forty, with a petulant baby face. She was trying to look reserved and severe. She hardly glanced at me before fastening sharp, suspicious eyes on Anita. \"Mrs. Ball,\" said I,...", "...state of mind, she turned away. \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \"I've something important to say!\" This sounded promising, certainly. Alice turned and came back again. \"Keep your temper,\" said the Caterpillar. \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. \"No,\" said the Caterpillar. Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.

There appeared to be at least two hundred. One-fourth of the number would have been sufficient. The soldiers saw that they were in an ambuscade--that the Revolution, long threatened, had at length come; and, without waiting for the sanction of Captain Guardiola or his subalterns, they flung their carbines to the ground, and declared themselves agreeable to a surrender.

He lifted the bed of wool on which the opal had reclined, and saw beneath, no more jewels, but a little old pocket-book, worn and shabby with use.

It was several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before Dyson could bring himself to open the book a second time; he remembered the wretched exile in his garret; and his strange talk, and the memory too of the face he had seen at the window, and of what the specialist had said, surged up in his mind, and as he held his finger on the cover, he shivered, dreading what might be written within. When at last he held it in his hand, and turned the pages, he found that the first two leaves were blank, but the third was covered with...", "...with the Vitex in full bloom, surrounded by lawns of the richest grass and herbage; the partridge pigeon (Geophaps scripta) abounded in the Acacia groves; the note of the Wonga Wonga (Leucosarcia picata, GOULD.) was heard; and ducks and two pelicans were seen on the lagoons. Blackfellows had been here a short time ago: large unio shells were abundant; the bones of the codfish, and the shield of the fresh-water turtle, showed that they did not want food.

Suddenly, while she stood thus, she dropped bodily, going fully under the water for a brief moment, as if renewing her baptism, and when she presently lifted herself, she was crying aloud, sobbing as a child sobs in the awful momentary despair of grief at the untwining of arms--shaken, unrestrained. While she stood thus for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> only,--a pathetic waste of sorrow, wet, dark and forlorn, alone on the night-shore,--a sudden wind, a common evening current, threw a foaming wave over the logs beside her so that its spray covered her over; while the straining ropes, breaking and bumping timbers, with the slow dripping of the spent wave through the raft, seemed to answer and possibly to assuage her agitation; for, as the wind passed and the waters subsided, she suddenly grew still, and, climbing the bank as...", "...doings.

I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\" \"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\" I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered. \"Good-morning, madam,\" said Holmes cheerily. \"My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire.

The rivers falling into it are the Inkokwasi, Umvungu, Chamgani, Kagane, Umkhosi, Kame, Mapui, Amatza, Amaboguana, and the Umfulamokokgumale, which supply the country with water. Upon several are situated many of the most important military kraals, viz. Amaboguana, Inyatine, Umkano, Umganine, Umhalbatine, Umslaslantala, Gubuluwayo, Umzamala, Umbambo, Umshangiva, Manpangi, Inthlathlangela, and many others. The Gwaii enters the Zambese in 17 degrees 54 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> South latitude, and 27 degrees 3 minutes East longitude, passing through the Abutua region, which is thickly wooded. The next important rivers are the Umnyaki, the Umvuli, and the Mazoe, and their several branches. The country is very hilly, clothed with dense bush towards the Zambese. The scenery is grand in many parts; bold massive granite rocks standing out far above the surrounding country give a wildness to the landscape. The Lobolo mountain is the eastern termination...", "...Caura from those of the Ventuari. Fifth. The chain of Carichana and of Paruaci (latitude 6 degrees 25 minutes), wild in aspect, but surrounded by charming meadows.

People had seen him. Fact followed rumor. His existence became certainty. The Law took up once more his hazardous trail, and David Carrigan was the messenger it sent. \"Bring him back, alive or dead,\" were Superintendent McVane's last words. And now, thinking of that parting injunction, Carrigan grinned, even as the sweat of death dampened his face in the heat of the afternoon sun. For at the end of those sixty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> that had passed since his midday pot of tea, the grimly, atrociously unexpected had happened, like a thunderbolt out of the azure of the sky. II Huddled behind a rock which was scarcely larger than his body, groveling in the white, soft sand like a turtle making a nest for its eggs, Carrigan told himself this without any reservation. He was, as he kept repeating to himself for the comfort of his soul, in a deuce of a fix. His head was bare--simply because a bullet...", "...the inventor of this poison, composes it by mixing a salt of strychnine with one-twentieth of woorali. To apply it to whale fishing, he makes the compound up into cartridges of thirty grammes (an ounce) each, which is enough to kill an animal of 60,000 kilogrammes weight. Each cartridge is imbedded in the gunpowder contained in an explosive shell which is fired off on the whale. In a late whaling voyage ten whales received such missiles, and all died within from four to eighteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the infliction of the wound. Out of these ten whales, six were cut up for their blubber and whalebone. Their remains were handled by careless men, who frequently had scratches and sores on their skin, and yet not one of them suffered the slightest injury, a circumstance which Shows that the poison cannot be transmitted from the fish to the men. Its poisonous action on the whale is, however, so great that practically the dose will have to be diminished, so that the death...", "...go.\" Another moment found me at the top of the partition wall again with the boy beside me. Unbuckling my harness I snapped it together with a single long strap which I lowered to the waiting Xodar below. He grasped the end and was soon sitting beside us. \"How simple,\" he laughed. \"The balance should be even simpler,\" I replied. Then I raised myself to the top of the outer wall of the prison, just so that I could peer over and locate the passing sentry. For a matter of five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I waited and then he came in sight on his slow and snail-like beat about the structure. I watched him until he had made the turn at the end of the building which carried him out of sight of the side of the prison that was to witness our dash for freedom. The moment his form disappeared I grasped Xodar and drew him to the top of the wall. Placing one end of my harness strap in his hands I lowered him quickly to the ground below. Then the boy grasped the strap and slid down...", "...At this moment, Faringhea entered, and said to Rodin: \"A man with a letter, not finding you at home, has been sent on here. Am I to receive it? He says it comes from the Abbe d'Aigrigny. \"Certainly,\" answered Rodin. \"That is,\" he added, \"with the prince's permission.\" Djalma nodded in reply; Faringhea went out. \"You will excuse what I have done, dear prince. I expected this morning a very important letter. As it was late in coming to hand, I ordered it to be sent on.\" A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after, Faringhea returned with the letter, which he delivered to Rodin--and the half-caste again withdrew. CHAPTER XLIV. ADRIENNE AND DJALMA. When Faringhea had quitted the room, Rodin took the letter from Abbe d'Aigrigny with one hand, and with the other appeared to be looking for something, first in the side pocket of his great-coat, then in the pocket behind, then in that of his trousers; and, not finding what he sought, he laid the letter on his knee, and felt...", "...for weeks.\" \"But if he's been wounded or lost his identification disc--a hundred things.

Eric spent the next five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> being pushed round a large library, which seemed to contain twice as many voices as people, and introduced to a second person before he had fixed the identity of the first. Lady Crawleigh was timorous and subdued, with an air of having been all her life interrupted in the middle of her sentences and with a compensating pair of flashing pigeon's eyes which seemed to miss nothing. \"I'm so glad Babs gave us the opportunity of meeting you,\" she said to Eric. \"I enjoyed your play...", "...one, to-day, of the news--let it come out in the _Morning Post_, to-morrow.

I had forgotten! Yes, tell him; he is a first class chap, he'll understand, and, I say\"--and he pulled some sovereigns from his pocket--\"do give him these from me for this term.\" Then with a smile he went. And a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards a small, slender boy of fourteen, with only Eton's own inimitable self-confidence and delicious swagger printed upon his every line, drove up to the door, and, paying for the taxi in a lordly way, came into his mother's morning-room. There had been a gap in the family after Tristram's appearance, caused by the death, from diphtheria, of two other boys; then came the two girls of twenty and nineteen respectively and, lastly, Cyril. His big, blue eyes rounded with...", "...the prison office. \"A wonderful man!\" said the latter, as they went. \"We love and respect him and give him all the liberty we can. For a long time he has been nursing in the hospital, and when I see that he is overworking I bring him to my office and set him at easy jobs.\" Darrel came presently, and they went to dinner. The tinker bowed politely to the warden's wife and led her to the table. \"Good friends,\" said he, as they were sitting down, \"there is an hour that is short o' <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> an' yet holds a week o' pleasure--who pan tell me which hour it is?\" \"I never guessed a riddle,\" said the woman. \"Marry, dear madam, 'tis the hour o' thy hospitality,\" said the old man. \"When you are in it,\" she answered with good humour. \"Fellow-travellers on the road to heaven,\" said Darrel, raising his glass, \"St. Peter is fond of a smiling face.\" \"And when you see him you'll make a jest,\" were the words of the warden. \"For I believe he is a lover o' good...", "...was not conscious that he rose. He unlocked the door and stepped out into the forest; but he could never remember doing this. He only knew later that he had been in the woods and now was in his room at the hotel; all the rest was phantasmagoria, agony and defeat. He had crossed the Rubicon of this world's hopes and fears, but he had been unconscious of the passage. XXXIX.

I am cook this week in our tent. After breakfast built two cairns to mark spot and shoved off at quarter to eight. We started up a big slope on a S.W. course to avoid the pressure which lay across our track to the southward. It was a pretty useful slog up the rise, at one time it seemed as if we would never top the slope. We stopped for five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to look round after 21/2 hours' hard plugging and about 11/2 hours later reached the top, from which we could see the distant mountains which have so recently been our companions. They are beginning to look pretty magnificent. The top of the great pressure ridge was running roughly S.E. and N.W.: it was one of a succession of ridges which probably cover an area of fifty or sixty square miles. In this neighbourhood Shackleton met them almost to 861/2 deg. south. At the top of...", "...setting sun that our eyes were quite dazzled by its glare, it suddenly came into Peterkin's head that we had nothing to eat except the wild berries which grew in profusion at our feet. \"What shall we do, Jack?\" said he, with a rueful look; \"perhaps they may be poisonous!\" \"No fear,\" replied Jack confidently; \"I have observed that a few of them are not unlike some of the berries that grow wild on our own native hills. Besides, I saw one or two strange birds eating them just a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago, and what won't kill the birds won't kill us. But look up there, Peterkin,\" continued Jack, pointing to the branched head of a cocoa-nut palm. \"There are nuts for us in all stages.\" \"So there are!\" cried Peterkin, who, being of a very unobservant nature, had been too much taken up with other things to notice anything so high above his head as the fruit of a palm tree. But whatever faults my young comrade had, he could not be blamed for want of activity or animal spirits....", "...indistinct object broke the surface. It vanished, the canoe was swept back to the edge of the main rush, and for a minute or two Thirlwell and the half-breed struggled desperately. When they reached the slack again, there was nothing but angry water and racing foam. The man had gone and Agatha shivered and felt faint. After that she had a hazy impression of streaming woods and flying belts of gloom as they swept down through the slack, until they drove out upon the tail-pool. For some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Thirlwell and the half-breeds battled with the eddies, and then they floated on smoothly and a light began to twinkle among the pines. Thirlwell steered for the bank and Scott and some of the miners met them at the landing. Agatha was glad to leave the canoe, for her nerves were badly jarred. Thirlwell presented Scott, who took them to the shack, which looked as if it had been recently cleaned. He said Agatha must make use of it for a day or two, and he and Thirlwell would...", "...what was right,--and now it's come--it's come.\" He swung his leg from the table and walked to the window. \"They say that spot thar is where they're goin' to string me up.

One step, and he was beside Phelps. \"How did you know?\" he gasped. \"No one could have suspected it.

It's the only thing.

They were a herd of the deep woods. Not one of them had ever been near the settlements. Not even the wise old leader had ever seen a fire. This light, when the sun had set and no moon held the sky, was inexplicable. But to the deer a mystery means something to be solved. He has the perilous gift of curiosity. After a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of moveless watching, the whole herd, in single file, began noiselessly threading the lower windings of the maze, drawing nearer and nearer to the strange light. When the first smell of the burning came to their nostrils they stopped again, but not for long. That smell was just another mystery to be looked into. At the smell of the frying pork they stopped again, this time for a longer period and with symptoms of uneasiness. To their delicate nerves there was something of a...", "...regret and anxiety, the lad turned back into the lean-to. When he bent over the Indian lad, he uttered an exclamation of joy; from the matted hair and abundance of blood he had believed him shot through the head. A closer examination showed, however, that the bullet had only ploughed a neat little furrow down to the skull. Charley washed the wound clean, forced some of the brandy down the boy's throat, and dashed a cup of cold water in his face. The effect was startling. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the little Indian was sitting up, swaying drunkenly and in a half dazed way staring about the little shelter. \"You arc coming around all right, old chap,\" said Charley, cheerily. His voice and face brought back to the Indian lad with a rush the memory of the recent ordeal he had been through. He gave one glance at the unconscious form on the other couch and his hand darted to the hunting-knife at his hip as he staggered, dizzily, to his feet. \"Stop, you are among...", "...minutes East; distance 37 miles; latitude 44 degrees 45 minutes North, longitude 9 degrees 42 minutes West per Log, 8 degrees 28 minutes per Observation.

Briggs looked too. It was only a little lower than some stars of the second and third magnitude that he had been telling about only five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before, only it shone with a redder or yellower glare,--orange I suppose was the real color,--and was clear and strong as the light of Jupiter. \"'That?' says Briggs.

At the end of two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we unscrewed the cover and gazed inside, but there were no signs of freezing, and to make a long story short, instead of writing a book as I said I should, there we all were from half-past twelve to nearly two o'clock, when we decided to have dinner and leave the servants to finish it.

Due to the increasing use of synthetic products in Mrs. Mimms' home-century the tea plant, among other vegetation, had been allowed to become extinct. Ever since Mrs. Mimms' solo assignment to Eighteenth Century England, she had grown exceedingly fond of the beverage. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later Mrs. Mimms, one of Destinyworkers' best Certified Priority Operators, reached the Renting Office of the Greenlawn Apartments. \"I do hope the Superintendent is still on duty,\" panted Mrs. Mimms, setting her bags down very carefully. \"If the Research Department is correct--and it usually is--his hours are from 9 to 6:30.\" It was one minute past 6:30 when Mrs. Mimms knocked. \"Yeah?\" boomed a disgruntled voice. \"Come on in.

The reading aloud often sent him to sleep, and he used to regret losing parts of a novel, for my mother went steadily on lest the cessation of the sound might wake him. He came down at four o'clock to dress for his walk, and he was so regular that one might be quite certain it was within a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of four when his descending steps were heard. From about half-past four to half-past five he worked; then he came to the drawing-room, and was idle till it was time (about six) to go up for another rest with novel-reading and a cigarette. Latterly he gave up late dinner, and had a simple tea at half-past seven (while we had dinner), with an egg or a small piece of meat. After dinner he never stayed in the room, and used to apologise by saying he was an old woman, who must...", "...progress we occasionally caught a glimpse of the Rocky Mountains, which was an agreeable relief to the very dull picture that the muddy islands in our neighbourhood afforded. We halted to breakfast just before noon, and observed the latitude 67 degrees 51 minutes N.

Twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, from the window of his room, Philip saw a dark figure walking swiftly back toward the forest. Still later he heard the distant wail of a husky coming from the direction of the pit, and he knew that the first gun in the big fight had been fired--that Jean Jacques Croisset was off on his thrilling mission into the depths of the forests. What that mission was he had not asked him. But he had guessed. And his blood ran warm with a strange excitement.

Half-a-minute later there seemed to be an echo from a point still lower, and Azito declared that he heard two more shots even farther away. \"They're signals,\" said Ruggles. \"Confound 'em, why are they so careful?\" \"I daren't go any faster yet,\" said Will. \"The stream's too narrow. We shall get to the tributary directly, and then I'll make her go.\" A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> brought them to the broader stream. Then Will opened the throttle further, increasing the speed to twenty miles an hour. More shots sounded faintly in several directions. Ruggles turned his head and glanced up-stream. \"There's a canoe after us,\" he cried. \"Indians paddling like mad, and half-a-dozen fellows with rifles.\" \"They can't hurt us,\" said Will, and laughed as he heard the rattle of an ineffective volley behind. \"It'll be a near thing, though, if they've got...", "...was immense and rather terrifying.

As the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> lengthened, the gallery grew more and more obstreperous and turbulent. Wave upon wave of sound swept through the auditorium to break, roaring, against the obdurate curtain. When eventually a second figure appeared before the footlights, the audience seemed to understand that Max dared not show himself again, and why. It was with difficulty that the man--evidently the stage-manager--contrived to make himself disconnectedly audible. \"Ladies and ...\" he shouted, sweat beading...", "...again; and we will hope he put no more salt in the tobacco, not even to sell his brother's beer.

Even if you could win her, would you take a bewitched maiden to be your wife?\" It was a summer's day, and Dermot stood looking far away through the sunshine toward where, though he could not see it, the enchanted castle lay. He had stood in that same place a thousand times, looking toward it, dreaming over the old tale. For several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he made no answer to what the old woman had said; then all at once he turned round to her. \"Nurse,\" he said passionately, \"I have adored her for twenty years. Ever since I first stood at your knees, and you told me of her, she has been the one love of my heart. Unless I can marry her, I will never marry any woman in this world.\" He came to the old woman's side, and though he was a full-grown man, he put his arms about her neck. \"Nurse, you have a keen woman's wit; cannot you...", "...There was a silence of grim tension over the room when the accuser's voice fell quiet after its staccato peroration of incitement. The masked men gave no betrayal of final sentiment yet, and the woman rose unsteadily from her chair and pressed her hands against the tumultuous pounding of her heart. She could not still it while she waited for the verdict, and scarcely dared yet to hope. Rowlett had been long trusted, and had there been left in him the audacity for ten adroitly used <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of boldness, he might have been heard that night in his own defence. But Bas had, back of all his brutal aggressions, a soul-fibre of baseness and it had wilted. Now, with every eye turned on him, with the scales of his fate still trembling, the accused wretch cast furtive glances toward the door, weighing and considering the chances of escape. He abandoned that as hopeless, opened his lips and let his jaw sag, then crouched back as though in the shadow of the room's corner...", "...been told now,\" said Jane, \"and no work need ever seem horrid to you again. Just look at it in my way after this.\" \"But all work seems horrid to me. I'd like to marry an awfully rich man and never see this place again.

Then Andy ran to the door and continued to cough, until the awkward question was forgotten. Other workmen came up, and the talk became general. Perhaps Carrow suspected that the boy did not wish to answer him, for he did not refer to the matter again. After thanking his friend for the dinner, Andy walked back to the office. He found the clerk smoking a pipe and reading a Bangor newspaper, having finished his midday meal a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> previously. \"It's no use,\" he said, as Andy came in. \"We can't possibly take you on.\" \"I came back to get a little information, if you'll be kind enough to give it.

Sometimes the ascent or descent is effected by a series of steps, or flight of locks, on account of the magnitude of the fall; and in such cases the loss of time becomes a serious addition to the cost of transport. In several instances engineers have got over the difficulty by ingenious hydraulic lifts, which in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> pass a boat through a perpendicular distance of many feet. At Anderton, where the Trent and Mersey Canal meets the Weaver Navigation, barges up to 100 tons displacement are raised fifty feet. Two troughs, each weighing with their contents 240 tons, are carried by two cast-iron rams placed under their centres, the cylinders of which are connected by piping. When both troughs are full the pressure on the rams is equal, and no movement results; but if six inches of water be...", "...The rustlers and other exiles from Tombstone knew the prisoner for a friend of the Earps, and so they decided to lynch him. They sent one of their number to get a reata for that purpose. The constable learned what was going on. He commandeered a buckboard and a team of mules, put Johnny Behind the Deuce aboard, and drove the animals on the dead run for Tombstone. When the man who had been sent for the reata returned, the rustlers set out after the prisoner and found they were five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> too late. They saddled up and started in pursuit. The road wound along the lower levels between the foot-hills of the Mule Mountains; there were two or three dry washes to cross, some sharp grades to negotiate, and several fine stretches which were nearly level,--a rough road, admirably suited for making a wild race wilder. And this was a wild race. The constable and the prisoner were just getting their team nicely warmed up when they heard a fusillade of revolver-shots...", "...our own personal desires?\" In a half minute Betty was out of bed with her Camp Fire dress nearly on. \"If you are going to turn preacher and reform at this time of life, Polly O'Neill, then goodness knows what is to become of me!

Another way is to take 3 heaping tablespoonfuls freshly ground coffee and 6 cups boiling water; grind the coffee as fine as possible; rinse out the coffee pot with boiling water, put in the coffee and pour on enough boiling water to cover it well; let it stand in a warm place for 5 minutes, but do not allow it to boil; then add the remaining boiling water, let it stand for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and either serve in the same coffee pot in which it was made or strain through a fine sieve into a hot silver or china coffee urn and serve at once.

When these things were ready, Morgan waited with seeming impatience. At the end of five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he rang the bell. A waiter appeared. \"Hasn't the wig-maker come?\" asked Morgan. In those days wig-makers were not yet called hair-dressers. \"Yes, citizen,\" replied the waiter, \"he came, but you had not yet returned, so he left word that he'd come back.

There was nothing else for him to do. Yet he knew that he would have to rise up, sooner or later, and face the danger that breathed at his back. The <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed, and with the passage of each minute he knew that by so much he was nearer the time when he must stand up, or else--and his wet shirt went cold against his flesh again at the thought--or else he might receive death as he stooped there over his treasure. Still he squatted on his heels, rubbing dirt from gold and debating in just what manner he should rise up. He might rise up with a rush and claw his way out of the hole to meet whatever threatened on the even footing...", "...for me, and he sings so sweetly himself. Didn't you like that song of his last evening about some '_Paese lontano dal mar_'?\" \"He has a good voice,\" said Ragna. \"But his trousers drown it!\" laughed Astrid. \"Come on, all of you, it is time to start!\" Fru Bjork led the way, burly in her domino, Estelle after her, and the other two followed, Astrid keeping up a gay chatter which saved Ragna the effort of conversation. They packed themselves into the waiting carriage, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> alighted at the Costanzi. It was early as yet and the crowd was thin, but more people were arriving all the time, some in fancy costume, but most of them in dominoes. Fru Bjork marshalled her party to the box she had taken,--it was in the second tier, near the stage, and there was a table in it as they were to have supper served from Aragno's. Estelle and Astrid pressed to the front of the box, and Ragna sat down on the little bench at the side, behind Astrid. \"Why, Ragna,...", "...Reaumur, she and Prince Frederick William hurried on foot to the Prince of Prussia's palace. From thence they went in a special train to Potsdam. There they found the King dying, and the members of the Royal family standing round watching the death struggle.

At one o'clock in the morning of January 2 they were again called, with the news that the King had not many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more to live. The letter in which all these facts are recorded is a remarkable composition, especially when it is remembered that the writer was only twenty. We may be sure that any thought of literary effect was far from her, and yet no one, reading it now after the lapse of so many years, can be insensible to the poignancy of this simple, unstudied, almost artless description of the scene in the death-chamber--the dim lamp; the silence broken only by the crackling of the...", "...Mark to be of the party.

He had seen Mark the day before, but only for a few minutes, because some poor creature had come running for his friend. But those few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> stood out sable against the white background of their previous intercourse. Never could he forget Mark's delight at seeing him: the light in his blue eyes, the grasp of his thin hand, the thrill of his voice. And yet, to offset this, was the grim fact that his friend's health and strength were failing. And this failure, measured by his (Corrance's) success, seemed tragic. Yet was it?

In ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Lon had made the acquaintance of a New York social leader at the next table and was dancing with her in an ardent or ribald manner before Ben had finished his steak.

He followed the bed of the river, himself, going at a slow lope, for he wanted time to think--to gain control of the rage that boiled in his veins. He conquered it, and when he came in sight of the butte he was cool and deliberate, though on his face was that \"mean\" look that Carson had once remarked about to his friend Murphy, partly hidden by the \"tiger\" smile which, the Irishman had...", "...and there was a package that had to be delivered at once,\" Darrin answered. \"The manager offered me ten cents to make the delivery.

While Struve mounted guard at the rear, Cutter was to look out for the front of the building. \"Going in alone, are you, Rod?\" Cutter shook his head. \"If Vidal is in there, and Galloway and the Kid and Antone are all on the job, the chances are there's going to be something happen. Better let me come in along with you.\" But Norton, his mouth grown set and grim and chary of words, shook his head. Followed by Struve and Cutter he was outside in the darkness five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after he had entered the hotel. Struve, a shotgun in his hands, took his place twenty steps from the back door of the Casa Blanca, his restless eyes sweeping back and forth continually, taking stock of door and window; a lamp burning in a rear room cast its light out through a window whose shade was less than half drawn. Tom Cutter, accustomed to acting swiftly upon his superior's suggestions, listened wordlessly to the few whispered instructions, nodded, and did as he was...", "...done it? Come on! We'll go in and tell Mr. Whitaker and he may be able to give us a point or two. There's a light in the kitchen, and we'll probably find him there. Come on, fellows!\" Hastily the boys ran to the kitchen door, and in response to their knock Mr. Whitaker himself opened the door and stood before them. \"Mr. Whitaker,\" began Foster, \"do you know who took our horse and sleigh?\" \"Why! Why, I supposed that you did. Two young men came into the yard not more than three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago and took them away.\" \"They did? Then it _was_ the sophs,\" said Foster turning to his comrades. \"We'll never hear the last of it. We can't get a horse here, can we, Mr. Whitaker?\" he inquired eagerly. \"I fear not. I have none of my own, and there are not many to be had here anyway.\" \"Did they start toward Winthrop?\" \"I think so. They turned toward the lower road.\" \"Let's get after them,\" suggested Foster. \"A long way after them,\" said Will grimly. \"We never...", "...likes to have plenty of time to express all his ideas and tell you a good many anecdotes in between! I usually take my lessons from seven till ten in the evening. Then he puts on his coat and saunters along with me on his way to his \"Kneipe,\" or beer-garden, for he is far too sociable to go to bed without having taken a friendly glass of beer with some one. Every block or so he will stand stock still and impress some musical point upon my mind, and will often harangue me for five or ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before moving on. It seems to be impossible to him to walk and _talk_ at the same time! In this way you may imagine it takes me a good while to get home. On Tuesday there is to be a grand ball at the opera house which the Emperor and the whole court grace with their presence, and lead off the first Polonaise. There are two of these grand public balls every winter. The tickets are sold, and it is the sole occasion where the public can have the felicity of gazing upon royalty...", "...towards the house. Keeping well within the shadow of the trees, it paused to listen, then moved on for a dozen yards and stopped again. When it reached the top of the drive it crept off to the left in the direction of the tradesmen's entrance. Displaying great caution, the figure finally reached the scullery window, which by a curious chance was unfastened. After great deliberation, and much listening, it opened the window, and inserting itself feet foremost disappeared. Three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the back door was noiselessly unbolted and opened. The figure looked out cautiously, then retreated within, leaving the door open to its fullest extent. The first figure had scarcely disappeared before another approached the back door from the opposite direction. It must have come through the hedge and crept along in its shadow from the main entrance. The second figure paused, as if astonished at finding the back door open. For some minutes it stood in the shadow of...", "...by his income, coupled with what credit he enjoyed. Once, about midnight, he tried to arouse a drug clerk who slept in the store, and as he had worked this racket before, he coppered the play to repeat. So he tapped gently on the window at the rear where the clerk slept, calling him by name. This he repeated any number of times. Finally, he threatened to have a fit; even this did not work to his advantage. Then he pretended to be very angry, but there was no response. After fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had been fruitlessly spent, he went back to the window, tapped on it once more, saying, \"Lon, lie still, you little son-of-a-sheep-thief,\" which may not be what he said, and walked away. A party who had forgotten his name was once inquiring for him, describing him thus, \"He's a little short, fat fellow, sits around the Maverick Hotel, talks cattle talk, and punishes a power of whiskey.\" So before Stubb had even time to unsaddle his horse, he was approached to know the...", "...be considered flattering. It was made up of several ingredients, but embarrassment was predominant. There was a slight added color in his cheeks--a hesitation in his manner. He was off guard, and could not immediately collect himself. A secret fury of indignation at her own folly helped to make Wynifred's smile most coldly sweet. As she held out her hand she slightly arched her eyebrows as though he were the last person she had expected to meet; as indeed he had been, not three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago. He greeted her with some confusion, his eyes roamed over her dress, and never in all her life had she been so devoutly thankful that she was in this respect for once past criticism. Nothing gives a greater confidence than the consciousness of looking one's best. As the girl stood before Claud, she felt that to-night the advantage was hers.

We heard no more from the hunter until the moonlight glanced through the wall upon the blade of his knife. Then he uttered a short ejaculation, such as may be heard from the \"mountain men\" at peculiar crises; and after that we could hear him exclaiming: \"Look out, Rowl! Hang it, man! ye're a-cuttin' my claws!\" In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the hole was large enough to pass our bodies; and one by one we crawled out, and were once more at liberty. CHAPTER FORTY. MARIA DE MERCED. There was a deep ditch under the wall, filled with cactus-plants and dry grass. We lay in the bottom of this for some minutes, panting with fatigue. Our limbs were stiff and swollen, and we could hardly stand upright. A little delay then was necessary, to bring back the blood and determine our future course. \"We had best...", "...restful scene, the white houses showing through the verdant green of the new leaves. She could see her own home and thought she glimpsed her mother working in the garden at the rear. Then the picture faded as they sped down the lake and Helen gave herself up to complete enjoyment of the boat trip. There were few signs along the shore of the storm. After veering away from Rolfe it had evidently gone directly down the lake until it reached the summer resorts. In less than ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Rolfe had disappeared and the far end of the lake was in view. Preston slowed the _Liberty_ somewhat and swung across the lake to the left toward Crescent Beach, the new resort which several wealthy men from the state capital were promoting. They slid around a rocky promontory and into view of the resort.

It was pretty to see him making up his mind where to put the morsel, so small that it did not show in the beak. He turned his head one side and then the other, considered, decided, and at last thrust it in the selected mouth. The resting-time of the newly made matron was short; for when those youngsters were four days old--so fast do birdlings grow--the labor of both parents was required to keep them fed. Every ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of the day one of the pair came to the nest: the father invariably alighted, deliberated, fed, and then flew; while the mother administered her mouthful, and then either slipped into the nest, covering her bantlings completely, or rested upon the edge for several minutes. There was always a marked difference in the conduct of the pair. Six days the kingbird babies were unseen from below; but on the seventh day of their life two downy gray caps were lifted above the edge of...", "...the pit. But what of the daughters? Living like swine, enfeebled by chronic innutrition, being sapped mentally, morally, and physically, what chance have they to crawl up and out of the Abyss into which they were born falling? As I write this, and for an hour past, the air has been made hideous by a free-for-all, rough-and-tumble fight going on in the yard that is back to back with my yard. When the first sounds reached me I took it for the barking and snarling of dogs, and some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> were required to convince me that human beings, and women at that, could produce such a fearful clamour. Drunken women fighting! It is not nice to think of; it is far worse to listen to. Something like this it runs-- Incoherent babble, shrieked at the top of the lungs of several women; a lull, in which is heard a child crying and a young girl's voice pleading tearfully; a woman's voice rises, harsh and grating, \"You 'it me! Jest you 'it me!\" then, swat! challenge...", "...a neighboring town on business for the past two or three days, walked into the middle of this little tableau in time to hear the last sentence. Kate and Sanderson had failed to hear him, partly because he had neglected to remove his overshoes, and partly because they were deeply engrossed with each other. Though his rival's declaration, which he had every reason to suppose would be accepted, was the death blow to his hopes, yet he unselfishly stepped out into the snow, waited five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> by his watch--a liberal allowance for an acceptance, he considered--and then rapped loud and theatrically before entering a second time. Could unselfishness go further? Kate and Sanderson had no other opportunity for confidential talk that evening.

She retailed no gossip while submitting to...", "...distress so often occasioned in the first confinement by tenderness of the nipples. If the nipples be rough or nodulated in appearance, like a strawberry or a raspberry, they are more apt to become excoriated or fissured than if they present a smooth surface.

Simple tenderness of the nipples and slight fissures may be averted by the application either of a lotion of borax (two scruples of borax in three ounces of water, and an ounce of glycerine), of the honey of borax, or of the tincture of catechu, and by protecting the parts from the pressure of the stays and the friction of the flannel vest. It is of the greatest moment to the comfort of the mother, that all affections of the nipples should be prevented or...", "...fat of bacon and of roast beef, mutton, olive oil, salads, cornmeal and cereals, and take plenty of outdoor exercise.

It was a stinging cold morning, and we had to go over a little mountain range on the way, but the roads were hard and smooth as a pavement, and we made the trip at a clipping gait, but were thoroughly chilled by the time we reached Santa Fe. There was no fire in our room and I went to the landlord, Alex McDowell and asked him to send us something to warm us up. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a man came in with a tray and glasses and something he called Tom-and-Jerry and hoped we would like it. I think I never tasted anything so delicious, and I believe my wife appreciated it as much as I did, and the effect was marvelous. We were soon warm and comfortable, and by comparison with the experience of the past few days, it seemed a paradise indeed. This was my first acquaintance with Tom-and-Jerry, and while I became better acquainted with these gentlemen afterwards,...", "...the burning vessel. The Bellerophon had been overpowered by the weight of metal of L'Orient, and had lost her masts. The Swiftsure had also been engaged with this formidable vessel. Both had maintained an unremitting fire upon the French flagship. Admiral Brueys had fallen, and had died the death of a brave man on his deck. The ship was in flames; at ten o'clock she blew up, the conflagration having lasted for nearly an hour. When the explosion came, there was an awful silence. For ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> not a gun was fired on either side. The instinct of self-preservation, as well as the sudden awe on this sublime event, produced this pause in the battle. Some of the French, endeavoring to get out of the vicinity of the burning wreck, had slipped their cables. The nearest of the English took every precaution to prevent the combustible materials doing them injury. The shock of the explosion shook the Alexander, Swiftsure, and Orion to their kelsons and materially injured...", "...thin nose, sharp protruding chin, eyes that bulged slightly. \"The Devil,\" she thought without saying it. \"You've seen me before.\" The man favored her with a friendly smile. \"I--I guess I've seen your shadow more than once,\" the girl managed to reply. \"Handy sort of shadow,\" the man chuckled. \"You see, I'm a city detective.

Although he had had no desire to harm the family, if any, of the late Colonel Mannheim, it cannot be said that the Nipe felt sadness or compassion.

In the meantime I would keep watch, and observe their motions, and by firing one of the pistols would signal to them if I was in any danger. Lastly, I recommended that the oars should be removed from the boat, to prevent the mutineers making their escape to...", "...titles in the court records of Washington and Greene Counties.\" [5] This designation was often employed to classify those settlers who took up lands beyond the limits of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768, that is to say, west of Lycoming Creek on the north side of the West Branch of the Susquehanna.

However, adequate documentation and meticulous research characterize her work.

Thirty square miles of country were thus devastated.\" In the devastated lowlands and buried villages below and on the slopes of the mountain many lives were lost. From the survivors Mr. Norman gathered some information, enabling him to describe the main features of the catastrophe. We append a brief outline of his narrative: MR. NORMAN'S NARRATIVE \"At a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past 8 o'clock in the morning a frightful noise was heard by the inhabitants of a village ten miles distant from the crater. Some of them instinctively took to flight, but before they could run much more than a hundred yards the light of day was suddenly changed into a darkness more intense than that of midnight; a shower of blinding hot ashes and sand poured down upon them; the ground was shaken with earthquakes, and explosion followed explosion, the last being the most...", "...\"No cheering, please; the city and province of Santiago have surrendered.\" The members of the Gatling Gun Detachment walked to the top of the hill, and, facing toward the gallant enemy who had so valiantly defended the foredoomed city, silently took off their hats. All along the line the reception of the glorious news was marked by comments upon the gallant defense which had been made. There was no demonstration which could have hurt the feelings of so magnificent a foe. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the surrender the American trench was lined by American troops on our side and Spanish troops on the other. The Spanish troops brought bottles of mescal, aguardiente, and wine. Our troops carried hardtack and canned roast beef. These recent foes began at once to exchange the necessaries of life and souvenirs of the siege of Santiago. They fraternized as all brave men do after the battle. A few Cubans skulked around the rear of our line, despised by both sides. The next...", "...moment. Also boil about a handful of green peas.

Bob, I'm sure I can put in that wrist snap at last. And if I can I--I'll be playing in the 90's. Sure!\" He's a wonder, Penrhyn.

She put the baby to sleep and sat waiting with her pensive young eyes gazing at the leaping flames. She heard him stop and answer the call of an owl from the woods. A whip-poor-will was softly singing from the bushes nearby. He stopped to call him also, and then found an excuse to linger ten minutes more fooling with his dogs. The laggard came at last and dropped on his stool by her side. He sat for five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> staring helplessly at the copy she had set. Big beads of perspiration stood on his forehead when he took the pen. He held it awkwardly and timidly as if it were a live reptile.

The next instant he was lying on the ground, and a cry of dismay arose. The sphere had hit him just under the ear. He lay there unconscious, his left hand still clutching his bat, his face white under its coat of tan. Willing hands quickly lifted him into the dressing-room, and a doctor hurried from the grand stand. Bob, who had helped carry him off the field, came out after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and went to the bench. \"He's all right now,\" he announced. \"That is, he's not dangerously hurt, you know. But he won't be able to play again to-day. Doctor says he'd better go to the hotel, and we've sent for a carriage. I wish to goodness I knew where to find a fellow to take his place!

Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed in silence; she was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque,...", "...invisible enemy; then, in the smoke, he would be unable to make out his foe, and there would be no chance or time to take aim with the second barrel, and he knew what the result would be--the brute seizing him with teeth and claws, holding on fast while it tore him with its hind legs, as a cat does a rat. \"A miserable end at the beginning of one's life,\" thought Lane. \"Discretion's the better part of valour,\" he muttered. \"I'll go back and find another tree.\" He stood for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> longer, in the utter silence, listening for some movement from his enemy, but there was none. Then he began to hope that it had stolen away, and he moved slightly--drawing back to go in search of fresh lodgings.

The snarling ceased...", "...season. The third system in common use is by steam through radiators or coils of pipe connected to a cast-iron sectional boiler, or a steel tubular boiler set in brickwork. This system is in use in practically all large buildings; and its advantages are the moderate cost of installation (as the single-pipe system is very efficient and the pressure to be provided against in connections and fittings is slight); the ease of control (since any good equipment will furnish steam in twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> from the time the fire is started, and fresh coal thrown upon the fire with a closing of dampers will stop the steam supply in five minutes--or any radiator may be turned on or off in an instant); the ability to heat the entire house in any weather, or any single room or suite of rooms only; and, lastly, the moderate fuel consumption. The disadvantages of steam heat are no heat, or next to none, without the production of steam, involving some noise in operation, and danger...", "...France; the allies, it would be believed, had, by skilful manoeuvres, cut us off--hurled us into inevitable destruction. Moreover--your majesty will pardon me for this observation--we can no longer count upon the assistance of our German auxiliaries. They will abandon us at the very moment when we need them most. Even Bavaria is no longer a reliable ally, for, notwithstanding the benefits your majesty has conferred on her, she is about to ally herself with Austria. Sire, you said a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago that you counted upon the discord of the Germans, but this exists no more, or rather it exists only among the princes; but we have no longer to fight the latter alone--we have to struggle against the genius of Germany, which has risen against us, and for the first time the whole nation is united in hatred and wrath.

The dying man flung a failing hand out to Nicky, and his eyes were on him when what light still lingered in them faded and went out. Nicky wanted to take Ishmael away, but the old man insisted on being left alone with his dead brother for a while, and when Nicky, determined not to go far or be more than a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> away, had left the room, Ishmael went to the fire and dropped the letters in it one by one. He watched them burn away, and then crossing over to the bed again he sat down slowly in the chair beside it. Nicky had to send for the doctor, give the news to Marjorie, parry Jim's questionings; and when at last he went upstairs again it was to find Ishmael, in a deep sleep, slipped forward in his chair as though he had never left it, his head against the edge of the bed, so that...", "...at a sign he descended and held out his hand to Jack. \"I can manage, thank you,\" said the lad, and he jumped down on to one of the thwarts, and then, without assistance, took his place in the stern sheets; his father and the captain followed, the latter gave a short, sharp order, the boat was vigorously thrust away into the stream, and the next minute the four men were sending her along with a regular stroke which seemed to make the slightly-built boat throb and quiver.

A pang shot through him, and the blood began to rise to his white cheeks, as he made a tremendous effort to master the miserable sensation of...", "...\"You can try elsewhere and see if any one will offer you more.

That jeweler cannot distinguish real diamonds from the imitation article.\" A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after, he entered another store, in the Rue de la Paix. As soon as the proprietor glanced at the necklace, he cried out: \"Ah, parbleu! I know it well; it was bought here.\" Monsieur Lantin, greatly disturbed, asked: \"How much is it worth?\" \"Well, I sold it for twenty thousand francs. I am willing to take it back for eighteen thousand, when you inform me, according to our legal formality, how it came to be in your possession.\" This time, Monsieur Lantin was dumfounded....", "...and see this diplomatist who is in such evil case, and the lady to whom he dictates his letters.\" We were fortunate enough to catch an early train at Waterloo, and in a little under an hour we found ourselves among the fir-woods and the heather of Woking.

On sending in our cards we were shown into an elegantly appointed drawing-room, where we were joined in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> by a rather stout man who received us with much hospitality. His age may have been nearer forty than thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry that he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy. \"I am so glad that you have come,\" said he, shaking our hands with effusion. \"Percy has been inquiring for you all morning.

The man who yesterday had risked his life to save her boy was in imminent and deadly danger, and she--petite maman--could do nothing to save him. Every moment now she thought to hear milor's firm tread resounding on stairs or corridor, every moment she thought to hear snatches of an English song, sung by a fresh and powerful voice, never after to-day to be heard in gaiety again. The old clock upon the shelf ticked away these seconds and <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> while petite maman thought and thought, while men set traps to catch a fellow-being in a deathly snare, and human carnivorous beasts lay lurking for their prey. III Another quarter of an hour went by. Petite maman and Rosette had hardly moved. The shadows of evening were creeping into the narrow room, blurring the outlines of the pieces of furniture and wrapping all the corners in gloom. The sergeant had ordered Rosette to bring in a lamp. This she had done, placing...", "...rose the grim and silent mountains. Tarzan's blood leaped in his veins. This was life! He looked down upon the girl beside him--a daughter of the desert walking across the face of a dead world with a son of the jungle. He smiled at the thought. He wished that he had had a sister, and that she had been like this girl. What a bully chum she would have been! They had entered the mountains now, and were progressing more slowly, for the trail was steeper and very rocky. For a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they had been silent. The girl was wondering if they would reach her father's DOUAR before the pursuit had overtaken them. Tarzan was wishing that they might walk on thus forever. If the girl were only a man they might. He longed for a friend who loved the same wild life that he loved. He had learned to crave companionship, but it was his misfortune that most of the men he knew preferred immaculate linen and their clubs to nakedness and the jungle.

A gentle creature was in trouble--it was my business to stay and succor her. Then suddenly the thought flashed upon me that she loved the man who had betrayed us, that she had pleaded with fear for his life, and that her petition had been granted. The solution seemed almost complete, yet it found me no more willing to go. Had I not still to discover for what end we were leagued together? As I stood motionless, thus musing, the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and the company slipped away. I was left with the man of the doorstep, the second speaker, and the beautiful girl. While I was wondering by what pretext to remain, the second speaker came up to me and said cordially: \"We are so much obliged to you for coming.

He was a young, good-looking fellow, but, as I gazed at him, a vague resemblance to the stranger of the restaurant and to the...", "...money; but I give you my word I'm worth between six and seven millions clear and clean right now.\" I bade him good-night and left.

A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the Exchange opened, Addicks' banker rushed into my office and said the Delaware financier begged that I would return to New York at once, and whispered to me that in a conversation just held on the telephone Addicks had stated that he would accept my terms. I informed the banker I was not anxious for the job, but as he urged his own interest, I jumped on the noon train and in the evening was again in New York. It was a warm day and I was pleased to get a wire on the...", "...Lockhart the Gordons displayed their usual fighting power. In the \"Broad Arrow\" of February, 18th, 1898, Sir William Lockhart himself described the part they played: \"The Gordon Highlanders went straight up the hill without check or hesitation. Headed by their pipers, and led by Colonel Mathias, with Major Macbean on his right, and Lieutenant A. F. Gordon on his left, this splendid battalion marched across the open. It dashed through a murderous fire, and in forty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had won the heights, leaving three officers and thirty men killed or wounded on its way. The first rush of the Highlanders was deserving of the highest praise, for they had just undergone a very severe climb, and had reached a point beyond which other troops had been unable to advance for over three hours. The first rush was followed at short intervals by a second and a third, each led by officers; and, as the leading companies went up the path for...", "...the Passage du Palais Royal, \"and here is mine,\" added he, pointing to the Rue Neuve des Petits-Champs; \"go quietly, that they may not know that you ought to run as fast as you can, your hand on your hip so, and singing 'La Mere Gaudichon.'\" And the captain followed the Rue de Valois at the same pace as the watch, who were a hundred paces behind him, singing carelessly as he went. As to the chevalier, he re-entered the Rue des Bons Enfants, now as quiet as it had been noisy ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before; and at the corner of the Rue Baillif he found the carriage, which, according to its orders, had not moved, and was waiting with the door open, the servant at the step, and the coachman on his box. \"To the arsenal,\" said the chevalier. \"It is useless,\" said a voice which made D'Harmental start; \"I know all that has passed, and I will inform those who ought to know.

Instead of following the stream we turned to the right and descended by a sledge-track to Baldino, a village twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> below Pinzolo. In after years I satisfied myself that the cliff we had turned back from was visible from the high-road at the upper end of the gorge of Le Sarche. The rocks seen from a distance did not look so formidable as they had from above.

Come on, Walter.\" We mounted the low steps of the house and a negress answered the bell. \"Is Mr. Gonzales in?\" asked Kennedy. The hallway into which we were admitted was dark but it opened into a sitting-room, where a dim light was burning behind the thick portieres. Without a word the negress ushered us into this room, which was otherwise empty. \"Tell him Mr. Montez is here,\" added Craig as we sat down. The negress disappeared upstairs, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> returned with the message that he would be down directly. No sooner had the shuffle of her footsteps died away than Kennedy was on his feet, listening intently at the door. There was no sound. He took a chair and tiptoed out into the dark hall with it. Turning it upside down he placed it at the foot of the stairs with the four legs pointing obliquely up. Then he drew me into a corner with him. How long we waited I cannot say. The next I knew was a muffled step on the...", "...ears the mourning howl of the old dog on the mountain top. Almost threateningly he gripped Croisset's arm. \"Jean--if you don't come back--what will happen?\" He heard the half-breed chuckling. \"You will die, M'seur, pleasantly and taking your own time at it, which is much better than dying over a case of dynamite. But I will come back, M'seur. Good-by!\" Again the door was closed and bolted and the sound of Croisset's footsteps quickly died away beyond the log walls. Many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed before Howland thought of his pipe, or a fire. Then, shiveringly, he went to seek the fuel which Jean had told him was behind the stove. The old bay stove was soon roaring with the fire which he built, and as the soothing fumes of his pipe impregnated the damp air of the room he experienced a sensation of comfort which was in strange contrast to the exciting happenings of the past few days.

In Mark Woolston's instance it proved, what it was designed to be, a blessing instead of a curse. That single sip of wine produced an effect on him like that of magic. It enabled him soon to obtain his tumbler of water, into which he poured the remainder of the liquor.

He was two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in making this passage, sustained by a chair, into which he sunk not less than three times, and revived by a few more sips of the wine and water. In this state-room was a bed with clean cool linen, that had been prepared for Bob, but which that worthy fellow had pertinaciously refused to use, out of respect to his officer. On these sheets Mark now sank, almost exhausted.

The torrent seemed no less noisy, but measuring it by the projecting arms of the rock I could see that it was falling with a greater rapidity than I had dared to hope for. Within ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> it had dropped six iuches, but for the next ten minutes it hung stationary; and sometimes to my fancy seemed to gain.

The herds had been driven in, watering in the shallows as they forded the stream full fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before. There were only the surgeon, the adjutant, the quartermaster, and Lieutenant Willett seated on the veranda when Harris presently came back, silent as before, but clad in undress uniform, as neat and trim as that of the Latest Arrival, if not so new. Then came General Archer, his daughter, and the meeting. Then, a few minutes later, the bid to dinner, and then, barely an hour from that time, the dinner itself--a function the classmates marched to almost arm in arm when...", "...around in spite of my cumbersome steering apparatus. We were drenched by the sprays constantly, and the boat occasionally shipped water. By and by, powerful as my comrade was, his great exertions began to tell on him, and he was anxious that I should change places with him till he could rest a little. But I told him this was impossible; for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we changed, the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea, capsize, and in less than five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we would have a hundred gallons of soap-suds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be present at our own inquest. But things cannot last always. Just as the darkness shut down we came booming into port, head on.

It was the general opinion that William Rufus Holly, fat, yellow-haired, and twenty-four years old, was doomed to failure in life, in spite of the fact that he had a little income of a thousand dollars a year and had made a century in an important game of cricket.

From where I stood looking at them hartebeest, kob, waterbuck, and oribi were also all in sight. I could mention day after day such as these, when we saw myriads of game, often of many kinds. One afternoon of heat and sunlight on the parched Kapiti plains, teeming with wild life, I followed a lion, on horseback. During the gallop he ran for several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> almost in the middle of a mixed herd of hartebeest and zebra. When he came to bay, I walked in on him. In the background the barren hills, \"like giants at a hunting lay.\" Bands of hartebeests and of showy zebras, joined by grotesquely capering wildebeests and by lovely, long-horned gazelles, stood round in a wide, irregular ring, to see their two foes fight to the death.

As I was informed that the King would himself be present at the ball, I knew that German etiquette required that the company should arrive before his Majesty; and although now every minute I expected the arrival of the Callonbys, I dared not defer my departure any longer. \"They are certain to be at the ball,\" said Waller, and that sentence never left my mind. So saying, I jumped into the fiacre, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> found myself in the long line of carriages that led to the \"Hof saal.\" Any one who has been in Munich will testify for me, that the ball room is one of the most beautiful in Europe, and to me who for some time had not been living much in the world, its splendour was positively dazzling.

Bowles, who acted as master of the ceremonies, arranged what gentlemen should take what lady. He said, 'Dinner is ordered to be on the table at ten minutes past eight, but I bet you the Queen will not be here till twenty or twenty-five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after. She always thinks she can dress in ten minutes, but she takes about double the time.' True enough, it was nearly twenty-five minutes past eight before she appeared; she shook hands with the ladies, bowed to the gentlemen, and proceeded to the _salle a manger_. I had to take in Lady Emily de Burgh, and was third on her Majesty's right, Prince Edward of Saxe- Weimar and my partner being between us. The greatest delicacy we had was some very nice oat-cake. There was a...", "...telling me such an awfully good story about a friend of his. Do tell it again, Mr. Dwight! It'll make you laugh no end, Mr. Moxey.' The young man appealed to was ready enough to repeat his anecdote, which had to do with a bold cyclist, who, after dining more than well, rode his machine down a steep hill and escaped destruction only by miracle. Christian laughed desperately, and declared that he had never heard anything so good. But the tension of his nerves was unendurable. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more of anguish, and he sprang up like an automaton. 'Must you really go, Mr. Moxey?' said Constance, with a manner which of course was intended to veil her emotion. 'Please don't be another year before you let us see you again.' Blessings on her tender heart! What more could she have said, in the presence of all those people? He walked all the way to Notting Hill through a pelting rain, his passion aglow. Impossible to be silent longer concerning the brilliant future....", "...He just stretched himself out there on the white snow and looked away at the wide, white world, as contented as could be. But all at once he saw a strange, strange thing. Out on the roof of the silent sea, Little Brown Seal was sunning himself too, right close to the door of his home. He was taking little \"cat\" naps. You see, Little Brown Seal could not sleep down in his house in the ocean. It was far too damp down there. So he was lying there by his door, sleeping just two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at a time, then looking up to see if there was any danger near. Now that wasn't such a strange thing. Little White Fox had seen Little Brown Seal do that nearly every day, but the strange thing was that there was some one else out on the ice who seemed to be doing the very same thing that Little Brown Seal was doing,--taking \"cat\" naps. And stranger still, he did not seem to be one of Little Brown Seal's relatives! He was too long, and he didn't wiggle his body right!...", "...very good-looking young man. \"I couldn't go without saying good-by to you, Mr. Rollins, and thanking you again for the care you have taken of me,\" she was saying. He finally saw the little gloved hand that was extended toward him. Her companion was carrying her jacket and the little travelling-bag. \"Oh--er--good-by, and don't mention it,\" he stammered, struggling to his feet. \"Was I asleep?\" \"Asleep at your post, sir.

The unhappy barrister caught the quick glance that passed between them, and was vaguely convinced that they had been discussing him while he slept. Something whispered to him that they had guessed the nature of his business. \"My telegram was not delivered to him until this morning. Wasn't it...", "...and of still worse things. Quite absurd! Women are terrible when they hate. Imagine! A poor officer--practically a dead man....\" Novoa said nothing, so that the pianist would stop talking. He was afraid Spadoni might say some awful thing, repeating Dona Clorinda's gossip, with the rancorous joy of a woman-hater. Novoa, through his relations with Valeria, considered himself a partisan of the Duchess, and could not tolerate anything being said against her. They separated after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more of inconsequential talk. That evening Spadoni spoke to the Prince about his conversation with the Professor, and it gave him a pretext for repeating what Dona Clorinda thought of her former friend. But immediately the pianist repented of having done this, seeing the look of wrath which Lubimoff gave him. \"What a cad,\" thought Michael, \"peddling around a lot of female gossip, just because he has a grouch against women in general.\" He understood how Alicia might feel...", "...beat back to the Southward round all the Shoals, or seek a Passage to the Eastward or Northward, all of which appeared to be equally difficult and dangerous.

Medius' temper varied as he came and went; now he was gentle and affectionate, and then again he raged like a madman; and his wife outdid him.

Therefore we tarried only a short time at the pit. We rested the horses and ourselves, and felt for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the blessed shade of the ancient buildings. We were out of water, but the two or three scowling Arabs, with their long guns, who were idling about the place, said they had none and that there was none in the vicinity.

So everything was made easy for him, and he came back to his home beyond the dumps with the first feeling of contentment he had experienced since his wife had deserted him.

After the watchman was out of the way, five other minutes went to the cautious prying open of the window least likely to attract attention--the window upon whose drawn shade the convincing profile had been projected....", "...crossed the room to his cipher map, and ran his finger down a certain line of hieroglyphics till he found what he sought, and paused to read one passage carefully, twice. Then, when his face had straightened till his lips actually stretched themselves into the semblance of a sardonic smile, he dropped the subject of his thoughts, returned to the table, and made himself some tea. Glass after glass of this he drank, steaming hot. But no solid food passed his lips; and in twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he reseated himself and set about the writing of two letters, on the envelope of each of which he placed, in the lower corner, a peculiar mark--a sign of the Third Section, known to a few men, and signifying privacy and importance. These letters were the result of his recent cogitation; and both concerned the affair of the previous night. He had realized his situation to the full; and he knew that it must be faced. His sensations were unfamiliar, however; for it was many...", "...Essex, abandoned after a short trial the above composition, and substituted di-nitro-naphthalene 11.5 per cent. for the mono-nitro-naphthalene, and used thin lead envelopes filled with loose powder slightly pressed in, in place of the compressed cylinders containing loose powder. The process of manufacture is shortly as follows:--132-3/4 lbs. of thoroughly dried nitrate of ammonium is placed in a mill pan, heated at the bottom with live steam, and ground for about twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> until it becomes so dry that a slight dust follows the rollers; then 17-1/2 lbs. of thoroughly dry di-nitro-naphthalene is added, and the grinding continued for about ten minutes. Cold water is then circulated through the bottom of the pan until the material appears of a lightish colour and falls to powder. (While the pan is hot the whole mass looks slightly plastic and of a darker colour than when cold.) A slide in the bottom of the pan is then withdrawn, the whole mass working...", "...splash among the reeds, looking for their supper. 'We are getting tired of this moor,' they said, 'and to-morrow we think of trying another, where the lakes are larger and the feeding better. Will you come with us?' 'Is it nicer than this?' asked the duckling doubtfully. And the words were hardly out of his mouth, when 'Pif! pah!' and the two new- comers were stretched dead beside him. At the sound of the gun the wild ducks in the rushes flew into the air, and for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the firing continued. Luckily for himself the duckling could not fly, and he floundered along through the water till he could hide himself amidst some tall ferns which grew in a hollow. But before he got there he met a huge creature on four legs, which he afterwards knew to be a dog, who stood and gazed at him with a long red tongue hanging out of his mouth. The duckling grew cold with terror, and tried to hide his head beneath his little wings; but the dog snuffed at...", "...account to show the slightest ill-feeling. Let her see that, if we have lost everything else, we still retain our manners.\" She was herself so far from betraying any ill-feeling when she entered the Throne Room that she was almost overwhelmingly affectionate. \"My dear child!\" she said, advancing to Daphne, who was standing in the centre of the room with Mirliflor, \"so pleased to see you both back! but we're _all_ of us _that_!

A French brig was instructed to decoy the English, by manoeuvring so as to tempt them toward a shoal lying off the island of Bekier; but Nelson either knew the danger or suspected some deceit, and the lure was unsuccessful. Captain Foley led the way in the _Goliath_, outsailing the _Zealous_, which for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> disputed this post of honour with him. He had long conceived that if the enemy were moored in line of battle in with the land the best plan of attack would be to lead between them and the shore, because the French guns on that side were not likely to be manned, nor even ready for action. Intending, therefore, to fix himself on the inner bow of the _Guerrier_, he kept as near the edge of the bank as the depth of water would admit; but his anchor hung, and having opened his fire,...", "...summer was being pricked by wintry spears. On such a night as this Olive had called to her not to take cold, had warned her that it was bad for her voice to sit at an open window. She had been thinking about herself in Debrett and planning to be a marchioness; it was Olive's interruption which had brought home sharply to her the necessity of cutting herself off forever from the theater if she married Clarehaven. Yes, it had been a night just like this, and that other window was not five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> away from where she was sitting now. A taxi humming round a distant corner reminded Dorothy of an evening on the lawns at Clare when Doctor Lane had lectured her on the habits of night-jars. \"Country sights and country sounds,\" she exclaimed, and she shivered in a revulsion against them all, because, though she had proved her ability to share in that country life, the blind overseer Fate had withdrawn her to another environment and the overseer must always be...", "...paper, in order that I may give this man an order on the box office? How much is your bill? Ah, yes, I remember--seventy-five dollars. Here, take this and go and get your money at the box office,\" as he handed the order to the professor, who instantly made a hasty retreat through the nearest exit leading into the front of the house, Fogg disappearing at the same time in the direction of his dressing-room, to add the finishing touches to his make-up. By this time it was nearly twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past eight o'clock, and the audience had already begun to manifest indications of impatience. \"Handy,\" whispered Smith, \"I'm glad I came. If I am not greatly mistaken there will be a lively time here to-night. Mark what I'm telling you.\" Just then another individual approached the stage manager and inquired for Mr. Fogg. He introduced himself as Mr. Draper, the costumer, and he was anxious to see the star of the evening, to \"put up,\" as he expressed himself, for the...", "...long delayed. Sheridan had the habit of gesture; he could not \"take time to remember,\" he said, that he must be careful, and he had also a curious indignation with his hurt; he refused to pay it the compliment of admitting its existence. The Saturday following Edith's departure Gurney came to the Sheridan Building to dress the wounds and to have a talk with Sheridan which the doctor felt had become necessary. But he was a little before the appointed time and was obliged to wait a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in an anteroom--there was a directors' meeting of some sort in Sheridan's office. The door was slightly ajar, leaking cigar-smoke and oratory, the latter all Sheridan's, and Gurney listened. \"No, sir; no, sir; no, sir!\" he heard the big voice rumbling, and then, breaking into thunder, \"I tell you NO!

The investigation of the problem forms the subject of a paper[12] in the 17th _Annual Report of the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station_, 1900. The following are the results of the experiments:-- 1. An exposure of tuberculous milk in a tightly closed commercial pasteurizer for a period of ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> destroyed in every case the tubercle bacillus, as determined by the inoculation of such heated milk into susceptible animals like guinea-pigs. 2. Where milk is exposed under conditions that would enable a pellicle or membrane to form on the surface, the tubercle organism is able to resist the action of heat at 140 deg. F. (60 deg. C.) for considerably longer periods of time. [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Power Separator.] 3. Efficient pasteurization can be...", "...wasted. The hearts of both brother and lover were beating too hurriedly for that. Perhaps at that moment the object of their affection was in peril,--perhaps struggling with her ruffian abductor! Their timely arrival might save her! These considerations took precedence of all plans; in fact, there was no plan they could adopt, to remain concealed--to skulk about the place--to wait for opportunity--what opportunity? They might spend days in fruitless waiting. Days!--hours--even <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> would be too long. Not a moment was to be lost before some action must be taken. And what action? They could think of none--none but open action. What! dare a man not claim his own sister? Demand her restoration? But the thought of refusal--the thought of subterfuge--in fact, the certainty that such would be the result--quite terrified them both. And yet how else could they act? They would at least give publicity to the atrocious deed; that might serve them. There...", "...which was in your face when you came into the room.

One day we had one of these craft alongside, and having taken everything out of her that was worth moving, we very imprudently set her on fire before she was clear of the ship's side; and as we were on a wind, it was some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before we could get her clear. In the meantime the fire began to blaze up in a very alarming manner under the mizen chains, where, by the attraction of the two floating bodies, she seemed resolved to continue; but on our putting the helm up I and giving the vessel a sheer the contrary way, as soon as we were before the wind, she parted from us, to our great joy, and was soon in a volume of flame.

He then laid it on the floor, and, throwing aside all the material we had been using, looked around carefully, and gathered up some little sticks, not larger than matches, which he laid against the ignited cotton, with one point on the ground and the other touching the fire. Then kneeling down, he encircled the nascent fire with his two hands, and blew gently on it, with his mouth so close as almost to touch it. A slight smoke rose above the palms of his hands, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he stopped blowing. Placing the little sticks carefully together, so that all their points touched the fire, he went about picking up others a little larger than the first, and laying them in order one by one. With the circumference of his hands a little extended, he again began blowing gently; the smoke rose a little stronger than before.

I only know that in that little band of worshippers I was one of the most fervent--but I fear that I was worshipping one of God's creatures rather than God Himself. After the benediction had been pronounced over the standing congregation, I looked up at the sky and judged that well-nigh three hours must have elapsed since we sang the opening psalm, and to me it had passed in a flash. Never before had I known the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> fly upon such winged feet. I shook myself out of my dream and turned towards the minister. He had dropped on his knees and was engaged in silent prayer. Unwilling to disturb him, I turned once more toward the congregation which had already arisen from its stony pews and was standing clustered in little knots. I hesitated for a moment, and as I hung uncertain I felt an arm slip through mine. It was the minister. \"Come,\" he said, \"you must get to know some of my flock....", "...and coffee. I could eat a horse.\" Martin opened the door of the sitting room. Like the one in which she had slept so soundly the previous night, it was stamped with the character and personality of the other Martin Gray. Books, warm and friendly, lined the walls. Mounted on wood, fish of different sizes and breeds hung above the cases, and over the fireplace there was a full-length oil painting of a man in a red coat and riding breeches. His kind eyes greeted Joan. For several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she stood beneath it, smiling back. Then she turned and put her hand involuntarily on the boy's shoulder. \"Oh, Marty!\" she said. \"I AM sorry.\" The boy gave one quick upward glance, and cleared his throat. \"I told you that this house is mine. It isn't. It's yours. It's the only way, if you're to remain in the city. Is it good enough? Do you want to stay as much as all that?\" The puzzled look came back. For a moment Joan was silent, worrying out the meaning of Martin's...", "...He found himself in total solitude. The noise of footsteps had ceased. All was silent around, and no clue offered itself to guide him to the flying Person. He stopped to reflect on the means most likely to aid his pursuit. He was persuaded that no common cause would have induced the Fugitive to seek that dreary place at an hour so unusual: The cry which He had heard, seemed uttered in a voice of terror, and He was convinced that some mystery was attached to this event. After some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past in hesitation He continued to proceed, feeling his way along the walls of the passage. He had already past some time in this slow progress, when He descried a spark of light glimmering at a distance. Guided by this observation, and having drawn his sword, He bent his steps towards the place, whence the beam seemed to be emitted. It proceeded from the Lamp which flamed before St. Clare's Statue. Before it stood several Females, their white Garments streaming in the...", "...heat, and dusty roads would be certain to tax our endurance to the utmost.

Progress was maddeningly slow, and before many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had passed every man was puffing and blowing like a spent horse. A cup of acorn coffee and a fragment of brown bread could scarcely be declared ideal fare upon which to pursue such energy-consuming labour. And we had three miles to go!

Lack of time is not an adequate excuse for failure properly to assign the lesson. If there is but fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> for the recitation, all the more reason why this time should be used to the best advantage for the pupils. If one third of this time should be taken for the assignment of the next lesson (and this is usually not too large a proportion in elementary classes), then this much time should be taken. And, besides, if the lesson is well assigned, so that it is better understood and prepared by the class, more can be accomplished in ten minutes of actual reciting than in fifteen under...", "...in London was entirely impracticable.

However, Sophia did venture, and she returned a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> late for lunch, full of vigour, with two happy dogs.

She was soon to know. She heard him rise. She heard him saunter to the door. \"Thanks, yes. Ha, ha, you're too kind--really--yes--very happy, you know. To-morrow, is it? Good-morning.\" And with these words he went out. With pale face and staring eyes Ethel darted back to the window. He did not see her. His back was turned. He mounted his horse and gayly cantered away. For full five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Ethel stood, crouched in the shadow of the window, staring after him, with her dark eyes burning and glowing in the intensity of their gaze. Then she turned away with a bewildered look. Then she locked the door. Then she flung herself upon the sofa, buried her head in her hands, and burst into a convulsive passion of tears. Miserable, indeed, were the thoughts that came now to that poor stricken girl as she lay there prostrate. She had waited long, and hoped fondly, and all her...", "...fiver each,\" he said, and when I got back to college I went up to Jack's rooms to wait and see what he thought we should have to pay. I was nearly asleep when Jack came in. \"Phillips says we shall have to pay a fiver each, what do you think?\" I said, without turning round, and instead of answering me Jack went straight into his bedder and seemed to be washing himself vigorously. \"What are you doing?\" I shouted, but Jack went on washing, so I shut up asking questions. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he came back into the room, and stood in front of me with a candle held up in front of his face. His lips were swollen, and there was a great cut, which kept on bleeding, over his right eyebrow. \"I look nice, don't I?\" he said. \"I've had a fight with a man who told me that his name was Briggs.\" By degrees I got the whole tale out of him, but it is no fun trying to talk when a great coal-heaving man has hit you in the mouth with his fist. Jack had come home by himself,...", "...He placed the three articles in a heap, and then climbed over the broken timbers to the opening beyond. As he did this a current of pure, cold air struck him. \"There must be other openings to this cave or mine,\" he reasoned. \"Otherwise it wouldn't be so well ventilated. Well, I'm glad to have the fresh air. Where is that gold? If this is really the mine I ought to see some of it in the rocks.\" He walked along, throwing the light of his torch on the rocks as he did so. For several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he saw nothing that looked like gold, and his heart sank. But suddenly he gave a low whistle and in his excitement almost dropped his torch. For in a crack of the rocks he had come across a small \"pocket,\" as it is termed by miners. In the pocket lay a quantity of sand, and on top of this an irregular object about as large as a small hen's egg. \"A nugget! A nugget of gold!\" cried Dave, as he rubbed it off and inspected it by the light of the torch. \"A nugget of gold just as...", "...almost took from him the power of resisting by use of his reason the impression made by these strange tales of the widow and the buccaneer. Without believing these fabulous inventions, he was nevertheless frightened by them as one is by a bad dream. The chevalier hardly knew whether he was awake or asleep; he looked at the buccaneer and the widow by turn, with a stupefied air, almost terrified. Finally, being ashamed to show his credulity, he rose abruptly and paced up and down a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the hope that movement would dispel the torpor which he felt overwhelming him. Croustillac did not wish to be a butt for these two persons, and he almost regretted having embarked so imprudently in this mad adventure. He said to Blue Beard resolutely, \"Come, come, you are jesting, madame; do not trouble yourself; I comprehend the joke. I do not believe you as ferocious or as much of a magician as you wish to appear; to-morrow, I am sure I shall learn the secret of this...", "...the _Dolphin_ and carry you to her. And I didn't come alone; your brothers Edward and Walter are with me, and your cousin Chester also.\" \"Oh, what delightful news!\" exclaimed Harold, his eyes shining with joy. \"And your yacht is here?\" \"Lying down yonder in the harbor, just waiting for two additions to her list of passengers. But where is Herbert?\" looking about as if in search of him. \"Lying in our tent; on the sick list, poor dear fellow!\" sighed Harold. \"Can you wait five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> for me to get through here for the present? Then I will take you to him.\" \"Certainly; longer than that, if necessary. Ah, I see it was time--high time for me to come for you boys.\" Harold smiled in a rather melancholy way at that. \"I have grown to feel quite old since we have been here in the midst of so much suffering, and obliged to take so heavy a load of care and responsibility--performing serious operations and the like,\" he said with a sigh. \"I must find you a...", "...disgrace themselves by turning into a pack of mutineers, merely because they are required to do extra work to fit them for fighting the enemies of their country?

As he left he saw there was a great uproar on board the _Chacabuco_ as the...", "...fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse. Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable. Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as...", "...drawing her arm tight, tight to his side. \"With you, Wanda.\" There came a bright morning with the sun just blinking genially above the tree tops, with the warm glory of the full summer in the air, and under Wanda's window a voice calling softly. She had been asleep; she was not certain that she had not been dreaming-- But the call came again, still softly, still ringing with a note which sent a flutter into her breast. \"Awake at last?\" and Wayne was laughing happily. \"Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to dress, my sleepy miss, and meet me at the stable. I'm going to saddle Gypsy.\" She heard him hurry away, and for a little she lay still, smiling. He caught her up into his arms, as she came down the path, kissed her, told her not to ask questions and helped her into the saddle. He swung up to Little Saxon's back and together they rode out into the forest through the brightening morning. \"Wayne,\" she said when he had done nothing but look at her and drive the colour...", "...of Pierre Philibert, seemed to burn to the touch. Her cheek crimsoned, for a strange thought suddenly intruded--the boy Pierre Philibert, whose image and memory she had so long and innocently cherished, was now a man, a soldier, a councillor, trained in courts and camps! How unmaidenly she had acted, forgetting all this in her childish prayers until this moment! \"I mean no harm,\" was all the defence she could think of. Nor had she time to think more of herself, for, after remaining ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the Chateau, just long enough to see the Governor and deliver the answer of the Intendant to his message, the gray charger emerged from the gate. His rider was accompanied by her brother and the well-known figure of her godfather, La Corne St. Luc, who rode up the hill and in a minute or two dismounted at the door of the mansion of the Lady de Tilly. The fabled lynx, whose eye penetrates the very earth to discover hidden treasure, did not cast a keener and more inquisitive...", "...I couldn't sleep many minutes together, for I couldn't help thinking of what might befall the poor young gentlemen if the calm was to continue, for the fruit was spoiling, we had only an orange apiece for the next morning, and the wine and dry biscuit without water wouldn't keep life in them many hours, while another day's sun was striking down on their heads--I might hold out long after they were gone. This was the thing that troubled me. I couldn't lie quiet, and I was every ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> getting up and looking round, though I knew well enough that without wind no vessel could come near us. Towards morning I fell asleep for a longer spell. I was awoke by the sun coming into my eyes, and looking round what should I see but Master Spider sitting close to the basket of provisions, sucking away at an orange in his paws. I shouted out to the rascal, who only looked up and grinned and chattered as much as to say, `I want my breakfast as much as you do.' My voice...", "...but since he was not only harkening to me, but doing so with a marked, if peculiar, attention, I made the best of an extremely disagreeable task, and pleaded my cause with all the ardor of which I was capable.\" I here caught Miss Cooper indulging in a furtive little smile. \"When I concluded by bluntly asking him for the ruby, his face was a study.\" Maillot drew a long breath, and shook his head over the recollection. \"I wouldn't again undergo the ordeal of the succeeding <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> for a whole bushel-basketful of rubies, every one as large and priceless as the blessed stone I was after. It was a question whether I 'd have to defend myself from a sudden assault, or be treated as a dangerous lunatic. And all the time he sat there twiddling his thumbs, apparently oblivious of my presence. \"I can see the old gentleman now. He was sitting there where Miss Cooper is, his chin on his breast, and from time to time he would take me in with a look from...", "...move on!\" Masses of men came straggling up and the line grew longer and longer. Another double line was formed behind it, and then a third and fourth. Nearly everybody was on parade, only a few here and there were coming over from the tents. The Sergeant-Major observed them and shouted to the Corporal of the Police: \"Corporal, take those men's names--have 'em up for orderly room this evening.\" Then he turned to us. \"If you can't turn out a bit smarter, I'll have you on parade ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> earlier--this is the last warning yer'll get.\" The Police Corporal was standing over by the tent-lines, entering the names of the stragglers in his notebook. I could see a solitary figure issue furtively from a tent and slink round the bottom of the parade ground in order to join us from behind and escape observation. I wished him success and followed his movements with interest. But just as he was darting into the ranks, one of our Sergeants caught sight of him and said to...", "...coming to me on a sudden, I jumped to the ladder and darted on deck. I heard voices over the starboard side and ran there. It was not so dark but that I could see the outline of a Deal lugger.

Cromwell--Billy--where's Mr. Rodney?\" \"Here I am!\" cried I. \"My God, Paul!\" exclaimed the voice of Mr. Mason, \"this encounter is fortunate indeed.\" I shouted to the negroes to show a light, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Mr. Mason, Wilkinson, and a couple of Deal boatmen came over the side. I grasped my relative by both hands. I had not seen him for four years. \"This is good of you, indeed!\" I cried. \"But you must be perished with the cold of that open boat. Come below at once--come Wilkinson, and you men--there's a fire in the cook-room and drink to warm us;\" and down I bundled in the wildest condition of excitement, followed by Mason and the others.

Remember that.\" Abramka's hand went to his heart again, and the gesture carried the same sense of conviction as of old. \"Mrs. Shaldin, how can you speak like that?\" \"Wait a moment.\" Mrs. Shaldin left the room. About ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed during which Abramka had plenty of time to reflect. How could he have given the captain's wife a promise like that so lightly? What was the captain's wife to him as compared with the doctor's wife? Mrs. Zarubkin had never given him a really decent order--just a few things for the house and some mending. Supposing he were now to perform this great service for her, would that mean that he could depend upon her for the future? Was any woman to be depended upon? She would...", "...and I looked at each other. \"Telegraph for him,\" I said. \"Would he come, sir, do you think?\" \"Telegraph in Mrs. Haag's name. Simply say, 'Danger; come immediately.'

Presently the two surgeons came in, and conferred together for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in low tones. Then they turned to me and to the priest, who waited there likewise. \"We have probed and dressed the wounds, but she lies perfectly unconscious at present; two nursing sisters from the hospital have been sent for to take charge of her, and it will be necessary for one of us to remain here during the night.

He clapped his hands as a signal to the peasants to let go, and ten minutes later was soaring at a height of nine thousand feet. In that ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he had passed from an atmosphere of spring to that of winter; for although it was December 1st, it was warm weather on the earth. Perfect silence was around him, and when he clapped his hands the noise was quite startling.

Arthur started. \"The clamour is breaking out again, I must go.

The beauty of the day, the shimmer and sparkle of the river, with the soft lap of its waters, the singing of the birds over his head, all had no effect on him. His dark, beady eyes noted nothing but the boats that passed, none of which, as yet--though the afternoon was waning fast--contained Adrien and Lady...", "...and voted the measures contained in them. The House also accepted the recommendations and voted the necessary provisions upon its part.

There was no difficulty except upon a single point, the prohibition of slavery in the remainder of the Louisiana territory above thirty-six degrees and thirty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> north latitude. Was this to be taken as prohibiting slavery in the Commonwealths which might be formed upon this territory in the future, or did the Congress only intend to lay this restriction upon this territory merely for the period during which it might continue subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the general Government, the period of Territorial organization? If the former, the Missouri question would have to be fought over again whenever a new Commonwealth should be...", "...otherwise.\" \"I will come,\" she answered simply; Edgar moved in the direction of the stair, she following close behind him. She did not like to be left alone at such a height, in such a place, in the darkness, with a storm about to break. Of himself she had no fear; all that had been seemed to have passed away with her two victories over him in the struggle of wills. Moreover, the more recent apprehension--that of his madness--had also ceased. In the conversation of the last few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he seemed so rational, so clear, so unaggressive, that she no longer saw reason for doubt. So satisfied was she that even when he put out a hand to guide her to the steep, narrow stairway, she took it without thought in the most conventional way.

It seemed evident to her that there had been some rapprochement between the two who had so lately been...", "...we fell in with a merry party, and danced till the ladies left us, at three in the morning. Our dancing was none of the French or English insipid formal movements; the ladies sung Scotch songs like angels, at intervals; then we flew at Bab at the Bowster, Tullochgorum, Loch Erroch Side, &c., like midges sporting in the mottie sun, or craws prognosticating a storm in a hairst day.--When the dear lasses left us, we ranged round the bowl till the good-fellow hour of six; except a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> that we went out to pay our devotions to the glorious lamp of day peering over the towering top of Benlomond.

Two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later Sir Bridgman North entered, and Sir Lyster introduced John Dene. For a moment the two men eyed one another in mutual appraisement; the big, bluff Sea Lord, with his humorous blue eyes and ready laugh, and the keen, heavy-featured Canadian, as suspicious of a gold band as of a pickpocket. \"Pleased to meet you,\" said John Dene perfunctorily, as they shook hands. \"Now you'd better give me a chance to work off my music;\" and with that he seated himself. Sir Bridgman...", "...and entered the yellow room, into which a soft light from the hall fell in a welcoming path.

That must have been Ted, of course, and she must have known that Nora was now safely tucked in the comfortable bed in the guest room. \"She was waiting for me too,\" mused Nora with a twinge of compunction. \"I do wonder why they made such a fuss about me staying in the attic?\" It was delicious to have every one anxious about her,--so short a time ago no one but the...", "...more terrible than execution in the presence of a curious, glaring mob.

Nay, so subtly is vanity intertwined with our motives, the noblest and the most ignoble, that I can fancy a poor wretch with the noose dangling at his ear, and with barely five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to live, soothed somewhat with the idea that his firmness and composure will earn him the approbation, perhaps the pity, of the spectators. He would take with him, if he could, the good opinion of his fellows. This composure of criminals puzzles one. Have they looked at death so long and closely, that familiarity has robbed it of terror? Has life treated them so harshly, that they are tolerably well pleased to be quit of it on any terms?

Christine then, lovely and charming enough to wreck the chastity of a Xenocrates, would sleep naked with her uncle! True, he was old, devout, and without any of the ideas which might render such a position dangerous, yet the priest was a man, he had evidently felt like all men, and he ought to have known the danger he was exposing himself to. My carnal-mindedness could not realize such a state of innocence. But...", "...but in twenty minutes Elaine Dodge will be dead!\" He said it with a nonchalance that might have deceived anyone less astute than Kennedy. Suddenly there flashed over Craig the words: \"THE TRICK WILL BE PULLED OFF AT THREE O'CLOCK!\" There was no fake about that. Kennedy frowned. If he killed Clutching Hand, Elaine would die. If he fought, he must either kill or be killed. If he handed Clutching Hand over, all he had to do was to keep quiet. He looked at his watch. It was twenty-five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of three. What a situation! He had caught a prisoner he dared not molest--yet. \"What do you mean--tell me?\" demanded Kennedy with forced calm. \"Yesterday Mr. Bennett bought a wrist watch for Elaine,\" the Clutching Hand said quietly. \"They left it to be regulated. One of my men bought one just like it. Mine was delivered to her today.\" \"A likely story!\" doubted Kennedy. For answer, the Clutching Hand pointed to the telephone. Kennedy reached for it. \"One...", "...this is in your honour, you know!\" \"Surely not all,\" replied the girl, laughing. \"Still I don't know when I had such a delightful birthday, and I want to thank you for everything with all my heart.\" \"Everything!\" laughed Jack nervously. \"I've done nothing at all; why, I didn't even give you a present. That was through a stupid mistake of mine, which we needn't go into, because now's the time to rectify it. I've been waiting for a chance all the evening. The thing only came a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before dinner. But better late than never, they say, and so I hope you'll still accept this trifle from me, Miss Sellwood, with every possible good wish for all the years to come. May they be long and--and very happy!\" His voice vibrated with the commonplace words. As he ceased speaking he took from his waistcoat pocket something that was certainly trifling in size, and he set it on the balustrade between the two tea-cups. It was a tiny leathern case, and Olivia held her...", "...was easy to see that the craft was partly waterlogged, though still having her gunnels a considerable distance above the water. Either the boat leaked terribly, or else this water had splashed in from time to time as rougher places were encountered. \"Ready, Bandy-legs!\" cried Max. \"Watch your eyes, old fellow!\" warned Steve. \"And d-d-don't you l-l-let her g-g-get away on your l-l-life!\" added Toby, who was greatly aroused, and had been edging down toward the gutter for several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> now, evidently bound to be ready to lend a helping hand, if the other chum needed it. It really seemed as though some unseen hand might be guiding that half swamped rowboat, in the interest of those who were so greatly in need of assistance; for it came heading in toward the house, urged on by the grip of the changing current, and finally actually bumped confidingly against the wall below the edge of the roof. Bandy-legs was on the alert. He dropped over instantly, and...", "...Beresford--I remember I kept on using his name. She never denied it.

He hesitated a moment longer and then pulled himself abruptly erect, took my arm and walked quickly back to the house.

Are you aware that my wife is no longer here?\" \"So Stornaway told me--twice,\" Beresford answered wearily. \"Do you know she's--left me?\" \"I'm not surprised. I'm only surprised she ever came back. I don't know why she ever married you.\" O'Rane paused to steady himself. \"I believed until recently that she had left me for you,\" he went on. \"Now you can understand,...", "...indicated that Clennam was the unfortunate person at whom the challenge was hurled.

Few of those speculations could be very favorable to Bad News. Ryter obviously preferred to let things stand as they were until the Beldon freighter was taken and the major part of his group had returned from the subspace sections of the Star. At that time, Bad News could expect to come in for some very direct questioning by the security chief. The <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> dragged on. Under the circumstances, a glance at his watch could be enough to bring Ryter's uncertainties up to the explosion point, and Quillan also preferred to let things stand as they were for the moment.

In the first place, Mr. Frederick Roe was informed by the native Weilbarrin, that two white men and their native companions had been killed by the aborigines, thirteen days' journey to the northward, when he was at a spot called Koolanobbing, which is in south latitude about 30 degrees 53 minutes, and longitude about 119 degrees 14 minutes east. Mr. Austin lost eleven horses at Poison Rock (nine died, and two were left nearly dead), which is in latitude 28 degrees 43 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> 23 seconds south, and longitude about 118 degrees 38 minutes east, or about 130 miles from Koolanobbing, and in the direction pointed to by the natives. I therefore imagine it to be very probable that the whole story originated from the horses lost by Mr. Austin at Poison Rock, as I am convinced the natives will say anything they imagine will please. Again, the account given us at Mount Churchman, on May 5th, appeared very straightforward and truthful. It was very similar to...", "...confidence to Avis: \"Patty isn't the least scrap of a prig.

Your precious Wall Street and politics have got every one scared to death. Mighty lucky we'll be if a crash doesn't hit us.\" Had Bojo defended himself, the father might have reopened the question of his entering the mills; but he didn't, and after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of indefinite seeking for an opening Mr. Crocker went off as abruptly as he had come. The next morning Bojo, to end this depressing period of inactivity, made a resolve to accept any opportunity, no matter how humble the salary, and went down to see Mr. Stoughton to ask him for the chance to start at the bottom.

Meanwhile his wife, to whom he had explained the situation, got a few things together, dressed her child, and hurried down to the hydroplane, Will having offered to give them all a passage to the city. It occurred to him that the General would be delayed if the train could be switched into a siding adjoining the station. While the Spaniard...", "...doorway; but she made no sound. And Ashton-Kirk as he walked down the hall, smiled quietly to himself. CHAPTER XVII WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ROAD About half an hour after Ashton-Kirk had left the Vale mansion, a Maillard car drew up before the door. As it did so, an Italian laborer arose from the curb not far away where he had been comfortably seated with his back against a tree; then throwing his arms wide in a luxurious yawn, he started leisurely down the street. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, a veiled, dust-coated female figure descended the step; the driver of the Maillard was dismissed, and Miss Vale composedly took his place at the wheel. As the car started forward, the gauntleted hands guided it firmly; the steady eyes were set straight ahead as the lever was pushed first to one speed and then another. And as the rapid pulse of the motor was borne along the quiet avenue, the Italian laborer calmly appeared from around a corner, pushing a...", "...to dinner, and they didn't want to miss anything if we were going to move the prisoner. And I told them I had no idea when they were going to move the prisoner. About that time Chief Curry came up and he told them, he said, \"Oh, I think if you fellows are back here by 10 o'clock in the morning you won't miss anything.\" So they left with that and went to eat. Mr. GRIFFIN. Were there any other reporters around at that time? Chief BATCHELOR. No, sir. Then later, just a very few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, Chief Curry decided, well, he might tell the rest of the people out in the hall so they won't be hanging around, because they were apparently doing nothing, just waiting. So he went out and told them that if they would come back by 10 o'clock in the morning, they were not going to move the prisoner in the meantime. Mr. GRIFFIN. Did you talk with Chief Curry after he first spoke to these two newspaper reporters? Chief BATCHELOR. You mean with reference to the...", "...their protection. They gave it anyhow. In a second, Chundoo was surrounded by a mob of twenty mites, full of shrill cries and ineffectual beatings of tiny hands--ineffectual, till the tiniest, giving way to the natural Eve, slipped down and deliberately bit the enemy in the calf. Chundoo, yelling with pain, slapped right and left. Fatma, her fear gone before this attack on her pupils, flew to the rescue. Such a scene had not been enacted within those walls for two years. Before five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed even the stairs were blocked by infuriated mothers. When Chundoo had been dragged off the Kotwal, followed by half the matrons in the alley, Fatma sat down, dazed and dry-eyed, between her two charges. That bite had saved her; she would not have to go that evening, perhaps not even to-morrow. But afterwards? Girls had to be married, and Peru could marry her to any one he chose. Even the neighbours, when they heard about the husband, would side against her. And it...", "...benefit, and then dismissed us both under the charge of Mr Doubleday to our duties, and by the time one o'clock was reached that day, and I was informed I might go out for twenty minutes for my dinner, I was quite settled down as junior clerk in the Export Department of Merrett, Barnacle, and Company. CHAPTER TWELVE. HOW MY FRIEND SMITH AND I KNOCKED ABOUT A BIT IN OUR NEW QUARTERS. Smith and I had a good deal more than dinner to discuss that morning as we rested for twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> from our office labours. He was very much in earnest about his new work, I could see; and I felt, as I listened to him, that my own aspirations for success were not nearly as deep-seated as his. He didn't brag, or build absurd castles in the air; but he made no secret of the fact that now he was once in the business he meant to get on, and expected pretty confidently that he would do so. I wished I could feel half as sure of myself. At any rate, I was encouraged by Jack...", "...got lots of patience with children, and\"--laughing nervously--\"last summer I partly tamed a young wild-cat. I could at least tell the children stories, and teach them all sorts of wood-lore that would keep them busy and interested out of doors. Besides,\" she flushed still deeper, \"I _must_ find some way to earn some money soon. My very need of it would make me try all the harder to fill the place. I am on my way now to see Mrs. Rochester and ask her advice about what to do.\" A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later she and Mr. Rochester were walking rapidly along the road in the direction of the Williams House. As they crossed the wide foot-bridge which spans the creek, and climbed the hill on the other side, she told him of the work she had done the previous summer under the noted naturalist, Professor Carnes. \"He had arranged to send his fifteen-year-old niece to Lone Rock this winter,\" she added, \"but her physicians decided at the last moment that she needed a milder climate....", "...two worlds is wider than the material. Utterly unselfish and trustful, Eveena was almost pained to be reminded that the service she so extravagantly overprized was rendered to her sex rather than herself; while yet more deeply gratified, though still half incredulous, by the commonplace that preferred love to life. I had yet to learn, however, that Eveena's nature was as utterly strange in her own world as the ideas in which she was educated would seem in mine. I left her for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to dress for the first time in the costume which Esmo's care had provided. The single under-vestment of softest hide, closely fitting from neck to knees, is of all garments the best adapted to preserve natural warmth under the rapid and extreme changes of the external atmosphere. The outer garb consisted of blouse and trousers, woven of a fabric in which a fine warp of metallic lustre was crossed by a strong silken weft, giving the effect of a diapered scarlet and silver; both...", "...from the Body or South-East Point of the Island 1 1/2 leagues.

The South-East part of the Island, from which I take my Departure, by an Observation this day at Noon lies in the latitude of 16 degrees North, and according to our run from Madeira in the longitude of 21 degrees 51 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> West from Greenwich, and South 21 degrees West; 260 leagues from Tenerriff.

Some artillery appeared and was planted directly opposite the gate, not three hundred yards distant. One blast of that battery would, as Helm well knew, level a large part of the stockade. \"S'posin' I hev' a cannon, too, seein' it's the fashion,\" said Oncle Jazon. \"I can't shoot much, but I might skeer 'em. This little one'll do me.\" He set his rifle against the wall and with Beverley's help rolled one of the swivels alongside the guns already in position. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Hamilton returned under the white flag and shouted: \"Upon what terms will you surrender?\" \"All the honors of war,\" Helm firmly replied. \"It's that or fight, and I don't care a damn which!\" Hamilton half turned away, as if done with the parley, then facing the fort again, said: \"Very well, sir, haul down your flag.\" Helm was dumfounded at this prompt acceptance of his terms. Indeed the incident is unique in history. As Hamilton spoke he very naturally glanced up to...", "...noise.\" There were two long poles belonging to the boat, one of which was grasped by Wharton, while Anderson swayed the other, the remainder watching their movements, which could not have been more skillful. Pressing the end against the bank, and afterwards against the clayey bottom, the craft speedily swung several rods from shore. While the two men were thus employed, the others peered off in the gloom and listened for a repetition of the sounds that had frightened them a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before. They were not heard again, nor could the straining vision detect anything of the dreaded object, which could not be far away. Not a person on board doubted that a number of their enemies were near and searching for them. Dr. Marlowe would have taken comfort from this fact had the circumstances been different; for the men who were hunting for him would go to his house, since it was there they must gain their first knowledge of his flight; but, as he viewed it, it was...", "...sail'd round it in 4 Days; besides, the Mountains inland and the soundings off the Coast seem to indicate this Country to be more extensive than any they spoke of lying to the Southward.

His only question was as to how he could get there? He had not been seen by the guard, and, drawing back into the woods, he walked cautiously along to learn how far it might be to the next picket. To his delight he discovered that the sentinels were several rods apart, and each had been stationed on a ridge, with a small hollow, running directly up into the encampment, between them. Lying down in a thicket, he waited. Slowly the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed. Not until it was dark did he make a move. Then, as noiselessly as an Indian, he crept into the hollow, and again paused. No other sound than the regular tread of the soldiers as they tramped to and fro on their beat came to his ears; but both were coming toward him, and, hugging close to the ground, he remained motionless. As he suspected, they did not enter the gully, but, on gaining the opposite banks, called to each other, and then turned to retrace their steps....", "...or rather more closely resembling a caterpillar.

Since we have passed the 95th parallel of longitude, and 32nd of latitude up to the present moment we have been out of the region of birds, for during the whole of this period I have seen but two, one of which, a Petrel, has this moment visited us. We have however seen more Sea-jellies, Acalepha and Mollusca than before, and those of a much more beautiful kind. Thus nature has made up for the deficiency of one tribe of animals...", "...at the turn affairs had taken; his ill humor puzzled me--and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there were positively _no antennae_ visible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death's-head. He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention. In an instant his face grew violently red--in another excessively pale. For some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. At length he arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the furthest corner of the room. Here again he made an anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions. He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment. Presently he took from his coat-pocket...", "...oil 30 c.c. Collodion 10 c.c. Keep in a dark blue bottle in a cool place. ~Staining Paraffin Sections.~-- 1.

Then the horsemen appeared in a great mass on the Southern left, and had not time and chance intervened at the last moment Stonewall Jackson might have passed into obscurity. The increasing twilight was now just merging into night, and a wood stretched between the Northern cavalry and the Southern flank. The Northern horsemen hesitated, not wishing to become entangled among trees and brush in the dark, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the Southern infantry, falling back swiftly after beating off the attacks on their front, passed out of the trap. Sherburne and Funsten, two of Ashby's most valiant cavalry leaders, came up with their squadrons, and covered the retreat, fighting off the Northern horsemen as Jackson and his army disappeared in the woods, and night came over the lost field. The Southern army retired, beaten, but sullen and defiant. It did not go far, but stopped at a point where the supply...", "...informed the ladies that his lord, the Duc de Rohan, would be happy to receive them in the chateau, but that the carriage and the men must remain on that side of the river, as the boat could only contain four persons and none other could be had. \"Ah, that is the reason Monsieur de Langdale did not return for us,\" said Madame de Lagny, with whom Edward had become a great favorite. \"I was sure he had too much politeness to send servants for his lady if he could come himself.\" A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed in placing Lucette's little wardrobe in the boat, and then, with a heart somewhat faint and sad, she followed Madame de Lagny to the water-side, remembering but too acutely that on the opposite bank she was to be received by persons who, however near akin, were but strangers to her, and there, too, very soon to part from him whom she was not now ashamed to own to herself she loved better than any one on earth.

We can have just five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more in this palatial room, and then we simply must go on.\" And five minutes after the hour, Dorothy persuaded Tavia to leave the ideal spot, and, entering the elevator, they were whirled upward to the dress parade.

Marjorie decided to take the hint. Wandering about in a nightdress, with bare feet, was a very cold performance, and it was all she could do to prevent herself from palpably shivering. Keeping up her part, she gave a gentle little sigh, got into bed, laid her head on her pillow, and closed her eyes. She could feel Miss Norton pulling the clothes over her, and, with another quivering sigh, she sank apparently into deepest slumber. The teacher stayed a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> watching her, then, as she never moved, went very quietly away and closed the door after her. Nothing was said at head-quarters next morning about the night's adventures, but Miss Norton looked rather carefully at Marjorie, asked her if she felt well, and told her she was to go to Nurse Hall every day at eleven in the Ambulance Room for a dose of tonic. Marjorie, who had not intended her practical joke to run to such lengths, felt rather ashamed of herself, but dared not...", "...or Essen in this formidable establishment in the United States of America. At least unless he has been taking a rise out of me, for he does not seem to be \"green,\" as they say in his country, which means to say that he does not look very much like an idiot, this Ephrinell! And yet it seems that I must gradually have fallen sound asleep. Withdrawn from exterior influences, I did not even hear the stentorian respiration of the Yankee. The train arrived at Aliat, and stayed there ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> without my being aware of it. I am sorry for it, for Aliat is a little seaport, and I should like to have had a first glimpse of the Caspian, and of the countries ravaged by Peter the Great.

Over all these things now did he ponder during this long dreary day. He did not like to go out lest he should meet old acquaintances and be interrogated about his father, of whom he knew less than almost every one. He shunned the tone of compassionate interest men met him with, and he dreaded even the old faces that reminded him of the past. He could not read: he tried, but could not. After a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he found that his thoughts wandered off from the book and centred on his own concerns, till his head ached with the weary round of those difficulties which came ever back, and back, and back again undiminished, unrelieved, and unsolved. The embarrassments of life are not, like chess problems, to be resolved by a skilful combination: they are to be encountered by temper, by patience, by daring at one time, by submission at another, by a careful consideration of a man's own...", "...\"What do you know about Walton?\" Dan picked up his dinner card and spun it between his thumb and forefinger for a few seconds, and then with a slight smile replied: \"Why, not a great deal.

Having eaten heartily, and taken the water we were in want of, I only waited to determine the time of high-water, which I found to be at three o'clock, and the rise of the tide about five feet. According to this it is high-water on the full and change at 19 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past 9 in the morning; but here I observed the flood to come from the southward, though at Restoration Island, I thought it came from the northward. I think captain Cook mentions that he found great irregularity in the set of the flood on this coast.

The passengers, as they came down from the shore, stopped at these toll houses to pay the fare for the places to which they wished to go. The decks of the steamers, the platforms, and all the bridges were thronged with people, going and coming in all directions, and crowding their way to and from the boats; and every two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a steamer, having received its load, would push off from the platform, and paddle its way swiftly up the river among a multitude of others that were shooting swiftly along, in all directions, over the water. The volumes of dense, black smoke which rolled up from the funnels of the steamers made the atmosphere very thick and murky; and the whole scene, as Mr. George and Rollo looked down upon it from the parapet above, for a time seemed almost to bewilder them. \"Let us go...", "...his companions might have done under similar circumstances. The other members of the Goldwing Club looked at one another; and Nat Long winked at Corny Minkfield, as much as to say \"There is a cat in the meal somewhere.\" After the imperative warning from the skipper that nothing more was to be said about the forty-two dollars, no more questions were asked; but it was evident that the members all kept up a tremendous thinking on the subject. But even this matter became stale in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the excitement of the hour. \"Forty-two dollars is dirt cheap for a boat like the Goldwing,\" said Dory, breaking the silence. \"I have no doubt she cost four or five hundred dollars; but I ought to tell you that she has a bad name.\" \"A bad name!

She upset,...", "...his bright eyes watchfully fixed on the opening of the shed, and his whole attitude expressing that he considered himself \"on guard.\" It was evident that had the least human footfall broken the stillness, he would have made the air ring with as much noise as he was capable of. He had a vibrating bark of his own, worthy of a much larger animal, and he appeared to be anxiously waiting for an opportunity to show off this special accomplishment. No such chance, however, offered itself; the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and hours went by in undisturbed order. Now and then a rabbit scampered across the field, or an owl flew through the trees with a plaintive cry,--otherwise, so far as the immediate surroundings of the visible land were concerned, everything was perfectly calm. But up in the sky there were signs of gathering trouble. The clouds had formed into woollier masses,--their grey had changed to black, their white to grey, and the moon, half hidden, appeared to be hurrying downward to...", "...in the western country, were on the far side of Rainbow Creek. There was no time to wade across. Jack dropped her reins, hoping her pony would wander quietly away. She bent forward and ran as swiftly and silently as possible toward the straggling rail fence.

Jim Colter crawled after Jack, bringing with him his long rope.

The boy swung his hat in the air once, twice, three times. Then he repeated the signal. Jim crept through the fence like an eel. Without making the least sound that could be heard by the fellow, whose back was turned to him, Jim got within thirty feet of his enemy. Jack wondered what on the face of the earth Jim intended to do. Then her eyes widened...", "...and they'd prove their mettle. Ted rubbed Tammie's head reflectively. \"There they are,\" he observed, \"and one of these days I'm going to hang one of those heads over our fireplace.\" Tammie yawned and Ted laughed. \"Okay, so I'm bragging again. But I'm still going to do it. Let's go, dog.\" Having seen what he had come to see, he struck back down the mountain, through the forest of massive, gray-trunked beeches that marched like rows of orderly soldiers in all directions. Forty-five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later he emerged into his father's clearing. No shanty or casual cabin, but a solid log structure built by a master craftsman, the house was set back against the line of trees. Artfully designed, it belonged exactly where it was and as it was. The Harkness house fitted the Mahela as well as did the big beeches against which, and of which, it was built. With a wing on each side and a covered porch that jutted forward, somehow the house itself seemed to hold out welcoming...", "...Like a dead log he lay for little more than two hours, then he awoke with a start and stretched himself. \"Hoi!\" he exclaimed sharply, looking towards the canoe, which was distant from his lair about five or six yards. The exclamation had scarcely passed his lips when Adolay sprang up, and next moment went blinking, yawning, and stumbling down the bank with the provisions under one arm, the paddles and weapons under the other. Cheenbuk lifted the canoe and followed her. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they were once more out in the middle of the strong current, paddling with might and main. Now, it was well that they had used such diligence in their flight, for the pursuers were closer behind them than they had supposed. When the unfortunate Alizay was felled by the Eskimo, as we have described, he lay for a considerable time in a state of insensibility, but he was by no means killed--not even seriously damaged--for Cheenbuk's intense dislike to take life had not only...", "...Elmer,\" remarked the scout master, pointing to the left. \"I choose that because we will get some shelter from the wind, in case of a sudden storm.

Give way again, fellows, and I'll head the boat for our haven.\" Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, and the two boats had been run ashore. Then an eager troop of aching lads tumbled out, to stretch themselves, and express delight over having finally reached their goal. Quite a number of them had really never before been away from home over night, so that it required more or less assumption of gayety on their part to conceal their real feelings. But by degrees these would grow accustomed to the separation, and in the end it was bound to make them more manly fellows....", "...I come ter see Blossy twict a year afore we was married reg'lar; an' naow, I cak'late ter leave her twict a year fer a spell.

As the longitude of Cape Deliverance varies considerably in different charts, its determination by the three best authorities may here be given: D'Entrecasteaux places it in longitude 154 degrees 26 minutes East of Greenwich. D'Urville places it in longitude 154 degrees 26 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> East of Greenwich. Owen Stanley places it in longitude 154 degrees 20 minutes East of Greenwich.) Rossel Island (named after one of D'Entrecasteaux' officers) is 22 miles in length from east to west, and 10 1/2 in greatest width; it is high and mountainous, and thickly wooded, with occasional large, clear, grassy patches.

This induced Mrs MacArthur to embark on a disquisition concerning the ease with which ankles are twisted, from which she drifted easily into a discussion of Rugby football, its merits and demerits. The Head, after several vain attempts to jerk the conversation into other grooves, gave it up, and listened for some ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to a series of anecdotes about various friends and acquaintances of Mrs MacArthur's who had either twisted their own ankles or known people who had twisted theirs.

Fitted to a 'Bristol Badger' aeroplane, the total weight was 2,800 lbs., including pilot, passenger, two machine-guns, and full military load; at 7,000 feet the registered speed, with corrections for density, was 137 miles per hour; in climbing, the first 2,000 feet was accomplished in 1 minute 4 seconds; 4,000 feet was reached in 2 minutes 10 seconds; 6,000 feet was reached in 3 minutes 33 seconds, and 7,000 feet in 4 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> 15 seconds. It was intended to modify the plane design and fit a new propeller, in order to attain even better results, but, if trials were made with these modifications, the results are not obtainable. The Cosmos 'Lucifer' was a three-cylinder radial type engine of 100 horse-power, inverted Y design, made on the simplest possible principles with a view to quantity production and extreme reliability. The rated 100 horse-power was attained at 1,600 revolutions per minute, and...", "...of having made an unusual statement. \"Well, Lucyet,\" he went on, \"going to the Christian Endeavor to-night?\" \"I don't know,\" she stammered. \"No,\" she added suddenly, \"I am not.\" All endeavor was a mockery to her stunned soul. \"I dunno as I will either,\" he observed carelessly as he lounged out. It was nothing to her whether he went or not, though once it might have been. She sat still for some minutes after he had gone, looking blankly at the paper. The page which a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago had seemed fairly to glow with interest had become mere columns of print concerning trivial things; for an instant she saw it with Silas's eyes. John Thomas came limping for his mail. He had been detained on the way, he explained, and was late. She handed him his paper through the window, dully, indifferently. She was suffering a measure of that disappointment which comes with what we have grown to believe attainment, and is so much more bitter than that of failure. But the...", "...and South Dakota infantry. The advance of the slowly-moving regiment was irresistable and the natives fell back from their position after a stubborn fight. All that day the Malay resisted the American advance with fanatical frenzy. The artillery moved forward at the same moment, but many times was delayed by burning huts. After an advance of about 400 yards they again joined the infantry line, but they had arrived at a conspicuous and dangerous position on the road, where for thirty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they fought desperately in the open under a heavy fire from the Filipino intrenchments. It was here that Major Bell of General McArthur's staff rode up and requested Major Grant to move up beyond the Chinese Hospital, where the Tagalans in a fierce engagement were inflicting heavy damage on the infantry. Almost at the same moment Colonel Wallace sent word that a company of the Tenth Pennsylvanians had been cut off to the left, and Lieutenant Critchlow was sent with one gun up...", "...up on a coach box, just pullin' his leaders out of Dennis's pansy bed. There was about a dozen of his crowd on top of the coach, includin' Mrs. Dipworthy--Sadie Sullivan that was--and Mrs. Twombley Crane, and a lot more. \"Hello, Shorty!\" says Pinckney. \"Is the doll exhibition still open? If it is, we want to come in.\" They'd met the Bishop; see? And he'd steered 'em along. Well say, I might have begun the day kind of lonesome, but it had a lively finish, all right.

She liked Master Tom and wished to ride beside him; and the instant she learned which pair of ponies he was to drive, she hopped into the front seat of that buckboard. \"I'm going to sit with you, Tom,\" she said, coolly. \"I believe you've got the best ponies. And you can drive better than Bob, too.\" Tom didn't look overjoyed, and Helen, seeing the expression of her twin's face, began to giggle. There was, however, no polite way of getting rid of The Fox. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they were off, Jib Pottoway heading the procession, and Ricardo, the Mexican, bringing up the rear with the mule cart. \"You keep a sharp eye on them younguns, Jib!\" bawled Bill Hicks, coming to the door of the ranch-house in his stocking feet and with his hair touseled from his early morning souse in the trough behind the house. \"I'll hold you responsible if anything busts--now mind ye!\" \"All right, Boss,\" returned the Indian stolidly. \"I reckon nothin' won't bite 'em.\"...", "...little party was set in motion, Fox detaching himself from the others. As for Joe, he crawled after Hank, every muscle of his body vibrating. Every now and again his eyes went to the hut, now easily distinguishable; for though it was dark within the forest, there was still some light over the lake, while the hut itself stood silhouetted against the fast-failing rays of the setting sun as they fell aslant the water. Perhaps it took the trio ten minutes to reach the shack. Perhaps the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> were even shorter, though to our hero the time seemed terribly long. His patience, indeed, was badly strained before he had taken up what was to be his position. As for Hank and Mike, they were lying down within ten feet of the shack, on that side away from the door opposite which was Joe. It now only remained for Fox to send his signal. As for Hurley, there was no sign of him. He might have been a hundred miles away. Suddenly there came a loud neigh from the depths of...", "...no more.\" \"I see,\" said Dr. Rob gently. \"Poor laddie!

Talking and listening to Harold was one use of Paul. Now that it had come upon him, and he saw Alfred worse from day to day, the poor boy was quite broken-hearted. Possibly, when at his work, or riding, he managed to shake off the remembrance; but at home it always came back, and he cried so much at the sight of Alfred, and at any attempt of his brother to talk to him, that they could scarcely let him stay ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the room. Then, when Paul had gone to bed on the landing at seven o'clock, he would come and sit on his bed, and talk, and cry, and sob about his brother, and his own carelessness of him, often till his mother came out and ordered him down-stairs to his own bed in the kitchen; and Paul turned his face into the pillow to weep himself to sleep, loving Alfred very little less than did his brother, but making less noise about it, and feeling very lonely when he saw how all the...", "...nine feet or so long and about four feet wide by five feet high. It seemed to be a natural part of the floor, but Hyrst avoided it. On the opposite, the sunward side, there was a small windowlike aperture that admitted a ray of blinding radiance, sharply defined and doing nothing to illumine the dark on either side of it. Vernon's thought came to them, hard, triumphant, peremptory. \"Mr. Bellaver says you have ten minutes to come out. After that, no mercy.\" CHAPTER V The <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> slid past, sections of eternity arbitrarily measured by the standards of another planet and having no relevance at all on this tiny whirling rock. The beam of light from the small aperture moved visibly across the opposite wall. Hyrst watched it, blinking. Outside, Bellaver's men were drawn up in a wide crescent across the hill in front of the catafalque. They waited. \"No mercy,\" said Hyrst softly. \"No mercy, is it?\" He bent over and began to loosen the clamps that held the...", "...or eight French and Spanish ships opened a fire on the \"Victory.\" Mr. Scott, his secretary, was killed, Captain Hardy was wounded in the foot, and fifty sailors perished before the \"Victory\" returned a shot. At length orders were given to fire; and as it had been discovered that the French admiral, who hoisted no colours, was in the \"Bucentaure,\" of eighty guns, Nelson's terrible sixty-eight pounder carronade from the \"Victory's\" forecastle was turned chiefly against that ship. In two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> nearly four hundred men were killed or wounded in this ship; twenty of her guns were dismounted, and she was almost disabled. The next ship which the \"Victory\" encountered was the \"Redoubtable,\" against which she ran foul, the anchor of the one striking the spare anchor of the other, and the hooks and boom-irons getting intermixed or catching in the leash of the sails, holding the two ships together. Again the starboard carronade was fired, which cleared the French ship's...", "...in a volley, charged with leveled bayonets. The French stood firm, and the Ninety-second, numbering less than two hundred and fifty men, burst in among them; a mere handful among their foes. But just at this moment Ponsonby's heavy cavalry came up, and passing through the intervals of the companies and battalions, fell upon the French infantry. In vain the enemy endeavored to keep their formation; their front was burst in, their center penetrated, and their rear dispersed, and in five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the great column was a mass of fugitives. Great numbers were killed, and two thousand prisoners taken. CHAPTER XIX. THE ROUT. While Pack's brigade secured the prisoners taken by the cavalry and sent them to the rear, the cavalry themselves continued their charge. In vain Ponsonby ordered the trumpeters to sound the halt. Carried away by the excitement of their success--an excitement in which the horses shared--the three regiments galloped on.

The dogs came bounding toward them eagerly, well knowing what fun was afoot. The men got their guns from the kitchen and led the dogs across the hay-field to the spot where the chickens had been feeding. In five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the robber's trail was picked up, and the dogs were in full cry upon it. Red Fox, watching from his knoll behind the house, cocked his ears as the musical but ominous chorus arose on the sultry air; but he knew it was not he the dogs were hunting, so he could listen more or less philosophically. The reckless youngster who had stolen the chicken was terrified by the outcry which he had excited at his heels; but he was plucky and kept hold of his prize, and headed straight for...", "...seated. \"I wish you a happy new year, Miss Forrest,\" I said. \"May it be the happiest year you have ever known.\" She looked around the room as if she expected to see some one else present; then, looking up at me, she said, with the happy look I loved to see, \"And I heartily return your wish, Mr. Blake.\" There was no coldness, no restraint in her voice. She spoke as if she was glad to see me, and wanted me to know it. Instantly a burden rolled away from my heart, and for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I was the happiest of men. Presently I heard voices at the library door, and immediately Miss Forrest's kindness and cheerfulness vanished, and those who entered the room must have fancied that I was annoying her with my company. I remained in the room a few minutes longer, but she was studiously cold and polite to me, so that when I made a pretence of going out to the stables to see a new horse Tom Temple had bought, I did so with a heavy heart. I had no sooner entered the...", "...in the warehouse, or carried messages, and generally did such odd jobs as were required. A fortnight after his arrival, one of the clerks was kept away by a sharp attack of fever; and as work was pressing, the agent asked Gregory to take his place. \"I will do my best, sir, but I know nothing of mercantile accounts.\" \"The work will be in no way difficult. Mr. Hardman will take Mr. Parrot's ledgers; and, as you will only have to copy the storekeeper's issues into the books, five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> will show you the form in which they are entered.\" Gregory gave such satisfaction that he was afterwards employed at office work, whenever there was any pressure. A year and a half passed comfortably. At the end of twelve months, his pay was raised another ten shillings a week. He had, before leaving England, signed a contract to remain with the firm for two years. He regretted having to do this, as it prevented his accepting any better position, should an opening occur;...", "...light anywhere, except the chilly, dazzling moon and the stars, and the glitter of a far range of god-like peaks, whence came the terrible wind. The scene and situation intimidated. The inhuman and negligent grandeur of nature was revealed. Felix returned into the car and shut the door, but could not shut out the cold. Lilian covered his chest with her warm bosom. Gently he pushed her away. \"No, no!\" \"Let me, darling!\" \"It's no use. I shall suffer for this.\" After a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the engine was throbbing again, and they had begun the descent. But no device could conjure away the ruthless night air. Back at the hotel Felix took brandy and hot water, accepted Lilian's hot water bag in addition to his own, and was in bed and thickly enveloped in no time at all. Lilian kissed him guiltily and left him. He bade her good night kindly but absently, engrossed in himself. VI The...", "...was buried. As they were about to descend, the old man gave a shout and pointed seaward--there, not a mile away, was a large ship, whose many boats showed her to be a whaler, and quite near the shore a boat was pulling swiftly in towards the landing-place. Rushing down to their companions they gave the alarm, and then a hurried consultation was held. \"We must meet them,\" said Adair, \"we can't hide the boat. If they mean mischief we can take to the woods.\" In another five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the newcomers saw the little group and gave a loud, friendly hail. Stepping out from his companions, who followed him closely, Adair advanced to meet the strangers. A young, swarthy-faced man, who steered, jumped out of the boat and at once addressed him. He listened with interest to Adair's story that they had escaped from a ship that had gone ashore on the coast some weeks before, and then said quietly-- \"Just so. Well, I'm glad that I can assist you. I've just come from...", "...of the evening and of her great triumph, suspecting no evil and thinking of no danger. A minute later the captain came to the door. There he saw Molly's chairmen, waiting with her chair. He looked about him. Where was Molly? He returned to the assembly. The girl was not there. He looked into the card room. His lordship was standing at the table looking on. \"My lord,\" said the captain, in confusion, \"where is my ward?\" \"Miss Molly? Why, captain, I put her into her chair five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago. She is gone.\" \"Her chair?\" The captain turned pale. \"Her chair is now at the door with her chairmen.\" \"What devilry is forward?\" cried Lord Fylingdale. \"Come with me, captain. Come with me!\" CHAPTER XXII THE ABDUCTION The daring attempt to carry off this heiress and to marry her by force proved in the end the most effective instrument in the success of Lord Fylingdale's schemes that could possibly be desired or designed. So great is my mistrust of the...", "...be that detains you in such a place?\" \"My dear Mary,\" said Crofton, \"you are, without knowing it, violating a hallowed principle; you are no less than leading into temptation. Look at poor Potts there, and you will see that, while he knows in his inmost heart the secret which detains him here is some passing and insignificant circumstance unworthy of mention, you have, by imparting to it a certain importance, suggested to his mind the necessity of a story; give him now but five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to collect himself, and I'll engage that he will 'come out' with a romantic incident that would never have seen the light but for a woman's curiosity.\" \"Good heavens!\" thought I, \"can this be a true interpretation of my character? Am I the weak and impressionable creature this would bespeak me?\" I must have blushed deeply at my own reflection, for Crofton quickly added,-- \"Don't get angry with me, Potts, any more than you would with a friend who 'd say, 'Take care how you...", "...Blount laughs. \"You, too, are severe upon our neighbor,\" she says, defending him more from obstinacy than from real desire to see justice done. \"I confess he is at times a trifle too mild, but not effeminate, surely?\" \"He is very handsome,\" says Portia, evasively. \"He has a charming mouth,\" says Dulce. \"I think you ought only to look at Roger's mouth,\" says Julia, prudishly, whereupon Dulce shrugs her shoulders, impatiently, and, turning, devotes herself for the next ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to the small artist lying at her feet--an attention received by the imperturbable Boodie with the most exasperating unconcern. The afternoon wanes; day is sinking to its rest. Behind the tall dark firs \"the great gold sun-god, blazing through the sky\" may still be seen, but now he grows aweary, and would fain give place to his sister, the pale moon. \"The sweet keen smell--the sighing sound\" of coming night is on the air. The restless ocean is rolling inland with a...", "...bag and sprang quietly up after it. \"Heat No. 1 pulled off at a paddle,\" commented Dale exultingly. \"The door is open, as I expected,\" whispered Max, who was too intent upon the work in hand to heed his friend's playfulness. \"Now I will light the lantern and we will go upstairs. The door of the manager's room is sure to be locked, but we shall make short work of that.\" As Max expected, the door was locked, but they had come provided with tools for all eventualities, and in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the whole of the bottom panels right up to the framework had been neatly sawn out in one piece. Through the aperture the two lads crept, drawing the bag through after them. \"Heat No. 2 won by a dozen lengths,\" cried Dale joyously. The room was a fairly large one, and contained the manager's desk, a really handsome piece of furniture which had been Max's father's, two or three tables, bookcases, a screen, and a large and massive safe. Max lost no time. Setting Dale to...", "...went to the window, and surveyed the portion of street that was visible. On the opposite pavement, at a little distance, a man was standing; it was Sidney Kirkwood. The sight of him roused her from apathy; her blood tingled, rushed into her cheeks and throbbed at her temples. So, for all she had said, he was daring to act the spy! He suspected her; he was lurking to surprise visitors, to watch her outgoing and coming in. Very well; at least he had provided her with occupation. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later she saw that he had gone away. Thereupon--having in the meantime clad herself--she left the house and walked at a quick step towards a region of North London with which she had no acquaintance. In an hour's time she had found another lodging, which she took by the day only. Then back again to Islington. She told her landlady that a sudden necessity compelled her to leave; she would have a cab and remove her box at once. There was the hazard that Sidney might return just...", "...of war,\" replied Deck, who did not propose to be led into showing the white feather, especially in front of such a coldly polished rascal as Captain Brentford appeared to be. \"Are you willing to be sent to prison, to languish there until the close of this struggle?\" \"I am willing to submit to that which I cannot alter.\" \"Ah, that is more like it.\" Captain Brentford looked around, to see that nobody was in sight. \"Major Lyon, I am tired, let us sit under yonder tree for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and rest.\" \"I don't care much to rest in these wet clothes. I may take cold.\" \"You are no wetter than myself. I think it may pay you to take the rest I propose.\" \"If you order a rest, I cannot do anything but obey, Captain Brentford,\" concluded Deck, and walked to the spot indicated. At the tent where they had stopped, his coat had been wrung out for him and his boots emptied, so he was not so badly off as might be supposed, although far from as comfortable as he would...", "...\"Because if it isn't worth that, it isn't worth anything.\" \"Take it out and let me have a look at it. Yes, just the spot. That whitish streak and that little puff of steam is where they're breaking stone. Make a good advertisement, wouldn't it, hanging up in your office?

Before the ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> were out, the bustling man had forgotten all about the fan he was in search of for his wife and, having assured himself that it was all oil-paint, every square inch of it, had propped it up against an ancient clock, standing back to see the effect, had haggled on five, then ten, then twenty-five, and had finally surrendered by laying five ten-dollar bills on the glass case.

All her plans were thoroughly shaped before execution; all her work was true, finished, and conscientious in every department.

The last time I saw her, which was for less than five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> accorded me by her nurse during her last illness, she spoke of a new plan of literary work which she had in mind, and although she attempted no delineation of it, said she was thinking it out whenever she felt that it was safe for her to think.

Their cheery voices, resounding through the half-gloom above the soft, crackling undertone of the kine munching their breakfast seemed to add to the warmth of the barn.

He got out a large sponge, took up the bucket he had brought from the well, and started at the end of one of the rows to wash clean the full udder of each of the forty-odd cows in turn. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the milkers would be ready to begin, and to keep ahead of them he must have a clear start of a dozen cows. When he had at last reached this point of vantage, the loud din of the streams against the sides of the milkers' tin pails had commenced behind him. He rose, straightened his shoulders, and shook his red, dripping hands with a groan of pain. The icy water had well nigh frozen them. It was a common thing for all about the barn to warm cold hands by thrusting them...", "...* * * * \"Quick thinking,\" said Tommy coolly. \"He thought we had this man a prisoner, and he'd be better off dead. But--\" Their captive was shouting again. His head thrown back, he called sentence after sentence aloft while the three ships soared back and forth above their heads, soundless as bats. One of the three rose steeply and soared away toward the city. Their captive, grinning, turned and nodded his head satisfiedly. Then he sat down to wait. Twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later a monstrous machine with ungainly flapping wings came heavily over the swamp. It checked and settled with a terrific flapping and an even more terrific din. Half a dozen armed men waited warily for the three to approach. The golden weapons lifted alertly as they drew near. The wounded man explained at some length. His explanation was dismissed brusquely. A man advanced and held out his hands for Tommy's weapons. \"I don't like it,\" growled Tommy, \"but we've got to think...", "...plunged into the water, and Cyrilo was after them almost at the same time. After a few minutes, which seemed hours, we spied the tail of the monster violently beating the surface of the water, then the whole body emerged with Cyrilo adhering to the alligator's belly, then both disappeared again, leaving behind a long bloody streak. \"Well done, Cyrilo, well done!\" cried Don Juan. Yet all that could be seen was the commotion of the water where the struggle was going on; a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more and Cyrilo came up, this time alone, breathing hard, covered with mud, and swimming towards us. I stretched out my hand to help him in, but he leaped into the boat without assistance and sat down quite still for one minute. \"_Este can me corto el dedo_--this dog broke my finger,\" he said, holding up his hand, of which the first joint of the forefinger was hanging down. \"_Pero me lo pago_--but I paid him out, and I reckon we'll soon see his ugly mug.

The spring was at some little distance from the road, it being necessary to negotiate several fences before reaching the white stone marking the spot where the ice-cold water gurgled forth. \"You were wise not...", "...beautiful Americans, those attired in Gillard's best, and ourselves, when we took to our rickshaws (and motors) again and set off for the President's palace, in the Forbidden City. The grounds of this palace presented a much better appearance than anything we had seen in Peking. The roads were newly swept, and everything was very neat and clean and orderly, though bare. The lawns, if such they could be called, were as arid and grassless as the great plains of Chili. We arrived a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before four, and descended from our vehicles, grand and otherwise, and then a cleaning-up process took place. Dusty shoes were brushed off with handkerchiefs, dusty coats slapped and patted, wind-blown hair rearranged, dust cleaned out from the corners of eyes, and powder-papers passed from hand to hand among the women. One lady remarked cheerfully, \"Well, we surely don't look very nifty to meet the President,\" but we made ourselves as \"nifty\" as we could, in the circumstances,...", "...long practice together before we play in public.\" \"You're very kind and patient with me,\" he said, as he gazed at the sweet calm face by his side. \"Nonsense,\" she cried. \"I'm cutting a few flowers for Miss Heathery; she is the most grateful recipient of a present of this kind that I know.\" They were walking back towards the house as she spoke, and from time to time Millicent stopped to snip off some flower, or to ask her companion to reach one that grew on high.

Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had elapsed, and not a soul remained under the monument to the victims of 1848; in its solitariness the Vascello preserved its appearance of a house dismantled with only its walls left standing.

I left two men to attend upon him, with orders to bring him on if better on the following day: we started on our journey, but we had not proceeded a quarter of a mile when Gazelle, that I was riding, was also seized with illness, and fell down; with the greatest difficulty I led the horse back again to the village. My good old hunter Aggahr died in great agony a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after our return, and Gazelle died during the night; the natives declared this to be the horse sickness that was annually prevalent at this season. The disease appeared to be inflammation of the bowels, which I attributed to the sudden change of food; for months past they had lived principally upon dry grass, but within the past few days they had greedily eaten the young herbage that had appeared after a few showers; with this, may have been poisonous plants that they had...", "...grandmother--one at least; and if a portrait of one grandmother belies the fact, then there is the other one to fall back upon, of whom, unfortunately, no portrait exists, and she was abs--so--lute--lee lovely!

When I returned from the House about midnight--I had gone there chiefly to dine, as lobster claws and melted ices appeared to be the only fare in prospect at home--tired to death, and conscious of an incipient cold in the head, arising from forced residence in a house in which hardly a door had been on its hinges for three days, I became aware that I was once again the lessee of a cave of harmony....", "...as if he had been through a struggle. \"It's hopeless,\" he said. \"Will you see her?\" \"Certainly,\" said Bok. \"Show her in.\" The moment the woman came in, she began a perfect torrent of abuse. Bok could not piece out, try as he might, what it was all about. But he did gather from the explosion that the woman considered him a hypocrite who wrote one thing and did another; that he was really a thief, stealing a woman's money, and so forth. There was no chance of a word for fully fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and then, when she was almost breathless, Bok managed to ask if his caller would kindly tell him just what he had done. Another torrent of incoherent abuse came forth, but after a while it became apparent that the woman's complaint was that she had sent a dollar for a subscription to The Ladies' Home Journal; had never had a copy of the magazine, had complained, and been told there was no record of the money being received. And as she had sent her subscription to Bok...", "...to tell me,' Mr. Beaves Urmsing brutally addressed the colonel, 'that you were at Eton when . . . why, what age do you give the poor woman, then!' He bellowed, 'Eh?' as it were a bull crowing. The colonel retreated to one of his defensive corners. 'I am not aware that I meant to tell you anything.' Mr. Beaves Urmsing turned square-breasted on Fenellan: 'Fellow's a born donkey!' 'And the mother lived?' said Fenellan. Mr. Beaves Urmsing puffed with wrath at the fellow. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, in the midst of the group surrounding and felicitating Victor, he had sight of Fenellan conversing with fair ones, and it struck a light in him; he went three steps backward, with shouts. 'Dam funny fellow! eh? who is he? I must have that man at my table. Worth fifty Colonel Jackasses! And I 've got a son in the Guards: and as much laugh in him, he 's got, as a bladder. But we'll make a party, eh, Radnor? with that friend o' yours. Dam funny fellow! and precious little...", "...glance he saw the situation. He dropped the bucket he carried, threw the door wide open and commenced action. Because of his great bulk he seemed slow, but every blow of his sledge-hammer fist knocked a brave against the wall, or through the door into the snow. When he could reach two savages at once, by way of diversion, he swung their heads together with a crack. They dropped like dead things. Then he handled them as if they were sacks of corn, pitching them out into the snow. In two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the cabin was clear. He banged the door and slipped the bar in place. \"Buff, I'm goin' to get mad at these thievin' red, skins some day,\" he said gruffly. The expanse of his chest heaved slightly, like the slow swell of a calm ocean, but there was no other indication of unusual exertion. Jones laughed, and again gave thanks for the comradeship of this strange man. Shortly afterward, he went out for wood, and as usual scanned the expanse of the lake. The sun shone...", "...She placed her cool hand on the hot forehead, and then she hurried from the room, promising to be back in a few moments. She went at once to the Colonel's study, hoping that he had returned from his morning constitutional, but he was not there. Going to the telephone, Mrs. Gray was soon talking to Doctor Carson. \"I'm so afraid our little girl has been exposed to some contagious disease,\" she said. \"Won't you please come over at once?\" The kindly doctor was at the house fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later and with him was the Colonel, whom he had met on the highway. The doctor examined the girl, who was too listless to heed what was going on. \"Geraldine is very ill,\" he said seriously. \"Come to think of it, Myra Comely told me that three of the girls, Geraldine among them, had brought her the wonderful news that she had to tell me about her mother's brother. Mrs. Comely had been ill for nearly a week with a form of influenza which is often fatal.\" Then, noting the...", "...of all sizes were discovered. Some of the former were many feet in diameter and extended from ceiling to floor; some of the latter were but a few feet high from the floor; but the formation is going on constantly, and many centuries hence these stalagmites will extend to the ceiling and become complete columns. The stalagmites were all a little concave, and the cavities were filled with water. The water percolates through the roof, a drop at a time--often the drops several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> apart--and more or less charged with mineral matter. Evaporation goes on slowly, leaving the mineral behind. This in time makes the immense columns, many of them thousands of tons in weight, which serve to support the roofs over the vast chambers. I recollect that at one point in the cave one of these columns is of such huge proportions that there is only a narrow passage left on either side of it. Some of our party became satisfied with their explorations before we had...", "...I'll come.... It's absolutely necessary for me to see you!...\" \"It isn't necessary for me,\" Stavrogin cut him short. \"Stavrogin will be there,\" Kirillov said finally. \"Stavrogin, it is necessary for you. I will show you that there.\" They went out. CHAPTER VIII. IVAN THE TSAREVITCH They had gone. Pyotr Stepanovitch was about to rush back to the meeting to bring order into chaos, but probably reflecting that it wasn't worth bothering about, left everything, and two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later was flying after the other two. On the way he remembered a short cut to Filipov's house. He rushed along it, up to his knees in mud, and did in fact arrive at the very moment when Stavrogin and Kirillov were coming in at the gate. \"You here already?\" observed Kirillov. \"That's good. Come in.\" \"How is it you told us you lived alone,\" asked Stavrogin, passing a boiling samovar in the passage. \"You will see directly who it is I live with,\" muttered Kirillov. \"Go...", "...and seized the leg of Iakov, who was preparing to accompany Malva. \"Stop! where are you going?\" \"Let me alone,\" said Iakov, making a forward movement. But Serejka had seized his other leg. \"Sit down by my side.\" \"Why? What new folly is this?\" \"It is not folly. Sit down.\" Iakov obeyed, grinding his teeth. \"What do you want?\" \"Wait. Be silent, and I'll think, and then I'll talk.\" He began staring at Iakov, who gave way. Malva and Vassili walked for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in silence. Malva's eyes shone strangely. Vassili was gloomy and preoccupied. Their feet sank in the sand and they advanced slowly. \"Vassili!\" \"What?\" He turned and looked at her. \"I made you quarrel with Iakov on purpose. You might both have lived here without quarrelling,\" she said in a calm tone. There was not a shade of repentance in her words. \"Why did you do that?\" asked Vassili, after a silence. \"I do not know--for nothing.\" She shrugged her...", "...backwards, Andy got the stirrup and put his toe in it and went up so easily that the ignorant might think anybody could do it. He dropped the rope and saw that it was Pink who picked it up. The brown at first did nothing at all. Then he gave a spring straight ahead and ran fifty yards or so, stopped and began to pitch. Three jumps and he ran again; stopped and reared. It was very pretty to look at, but Happy Jack could have ridden him, or Slim, or any other range rider. In two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the brown was sulking, and it took severe spurring to bring him back to the corral. Pitch he would not. The crowd applauded, but Andy felt cheated and looked as he felt. Pink edged toward him, but Andy was not in the mood for reconciliation and kept out of his way. Others of the Happy Family came near, at divers times and places, as if they would have speech with him, but he thought he knew about what they would say, and so was careful not to give them a chance. When the...", "...\"Could you identify the boy?\" asked the Europeans with one breath. \"I don't know his name,\" was Ramtonu's rejoinder; \"but I think I could pick him out, for he passes this office daily on his way to and from school. But this is just the time when he goes home for tiffin. With your Highness's permission, I will watch for him in the street.\" \"Do so by all means,\" was the Inspector's reply. \"Meanwhile, I'll take down notes of your statement.\" Ramtonu went out and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> returned dragging with him triumphantly a well-dressed lad of fifteen, who seemed terribly alarmed by the company into which he was thrust. The Inspector calmed his fears by assuring him that he would come to no harm if only he spoke the whole truth. \"You have been unwittingly made the instrument of a forgery,\" he added, \"and we want your help towards detecting it.\" The boy plucked up courage and answered every question put him quite candidly. His tale corroborated Ramtonu's in...", "...drawers of my desk that wouldn't shut. We had a terrible time with it, and I had to take everything out, and turn my desk topsy-turvy, and your letters and all my other papers got raving distracted, and all mixed up with bits of sealing-wax, old pens, and dear knows what not, when down comes A. from the school-room, to say that Mrs. Stearns had sent for me to come right out, thinking she was dying. I knew nothing about the trains, always trusting to Mr. Prentiss about that, but in five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I was off, and on reaching the depot found I had lost a train by ten minutes, and that there wouldn't be another for an hour. Then I had leisure to remember that Mr. P. was to get home from Dorset, that I had left no message for him, had hid away all the letters that had come in his absence, where he couldn't find them; that if it was necessary for me to stay at Newark all night he would be dreadfully frightened, etc., etc. Somehow I felt very blue, but at last concluded to get...", "...splash among fountains of spray, while a white ridge swept furiously toward the sloop. It broke before it reached her, but she flung her bows high as she plunged over the troubled swell, and the yacht rolled heavily with a yeasty wash along her side. Jimmy ran forward with a sense of keen satisfaction to break out the anchor. The powerful charge had done its work; the wreck had gone. While the _Cetacea_ drifted slowly with the stream the yacht's windlass began to clank, and a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later she steamed toward the smaller craft. Her gig brought off a hawser, and a message inviting Jimmy to come on board. As soon as he reached her deck the gig was run up to the davits and the throb of engines quickened. The sloop, swinging into line astern, followed along the screw-cut wake, and in half an hour the fog-bank about the island faded out of sight. Jimmy felt more cheerful when he dined with Aynsley in the saloon. The depression that had rested on them all seemed...", "...take Alila's place the animal would not stir to obey us. He would at once become stubborn and ugly, because he is not used to our quick, nervous, impatient ways. He cannot work all day like a horse. After two or three hours, he needs to stop and rest. But that is not enough,--he suffers if he cannot have a bath. Sometimes Alila rides on his back when he plunges into the river, and holds on without fear while the buffalo stretches his head down and holds it under the water for two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at a time as he searches for food. How Alila does love him! He has the next place in his heart to his father and mother. But the buffalo has other good friends beside Alila's family. They are not people, nor even other buffaloes. They are white herons that follow him as he ploughs. They are not afraid if Alila is the only person there. As the animal's heavy feet plod over the ground, worms and insects come to the surface. The herons know this and easily get a good...", "...may be allowed the metaphor, a mass of living heads. We owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Davis, the respected and conscientious officer for the Sheriff of Middlesex; that gentleman, in the kindest spirit of hospitality, allowing us six inches of his door-step when the crowd was at its greatest pressure. Several inmates of Mr. Davis's delightful mansion had a charming view of the scene from the top windows, where we observed bars of the most picturesque and _moyen age_ description. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to nine, Mr. Charles Phillips, counsel for the plaintiff, arrived in Lamb's Conduit-passage, and was loudly cheered. On the appearance of Mr. Adolphus, counsel for the defendant, a few miscreants in human shape essayed groans and hisses; they were, however, speedily put down by the New Police. We entered the court at nine o'clock. The galleries were crowded with rank, beauty, and fashion. Conflicting odours of lavender, musk, and _Eau de Cologne_ emanated from ladies on the...", "...th' noose over 'is horns.' \"'Not me,' growls Batty.

Fine place, sir.

We'll have a look around here and then walk along the beach and meet those three natives.\" Taking their rifles with them, the mate, with Velo and the white sailor Joe following him closely, walked up the beach and entered the forest of coco-palms.

Her mission had quite taken form--it was but another name for the interest of her great opportunity--that of representing the arts and the graces to a people languishing, afar off, in ignorance. Maggie had sufficiently intimated to the Prince, ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before, that she needed no showing as to what their friend wouldn't consent to be taken for; but the difficulty now indeed was to choose, for explicit tribute of admiration, between the varieties of her nobler aspects. She carried it off, to put the matter coarsely, with a taste and a discretion that held our young woman's attention, for the first quarter-of-an-hour, to the very point of diverting it from the attitude of her overshadowed, her almost superseded companion. But...", "...with a sickening jolt, as the loop over the cupola slipped down tight. \"Hooray!\" cried Phil, twisting the rope about one leg and waving a hand to those below him. They drew a long, relieved sigh. The farmers, one after the other, took off their hats and mopped their foreheads. \"Warm, isn't it?\" grinned the owner of the silo. \"Now, pass up your brush and paste on this rope.\" Phil had brought a small rope with him for this very purpose. Billy got busy at once and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Phil had the brush and paste in his hands, with which he proceeded to smear as much of the side of the silo as was within reach. It will be remembered that he was hanging on the rope by one leg, around which the rope was twisted as only showmen know how to do. \"Now, the paper,\" called Phil. This was passed up to him in the same way. In a few moments he had pasted on a great sheet, having first pulled himself up to the eaves to secure the top of the sheet just under...", "...never know, but what does it matter?\" the English youth grunted. \"The point is, _did_ they get word back about the Hawk and the Carson, or didn't they?

And worse luck, it probably will.\" Dawson just nodded, and let it go at that as he gave his attention to getting back to the task force as quickly as he could. It was about fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before they spotted the force on the horizon. And it was another ten before they were safely aboard the Carson, and a junior officer was leading them to the Admiral's quarters. They found Colonel Welsh there, too. And also the ship's executive flight officer. The Admiral took the salute, but it was Colonel Welsh who spoke to them. \"Nice shooting,\" he said quietly. \"Now let's have your report in detail.

His interest was immediately aroused. She assumed from that moment an individuality that excited his curiosity. Why, he wondered, had he been so entirely unaware of her before?--not unaware of her actual bodily presence in his home, but of her separate existence as a sentient human being,--a feminine human being with possibilities of engaging developments. He held her for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in conversation; then, quite pleasantly excited, he went downstairs, and sat on the stoep and smoked until Pamela returned. Pamela found him in a mood of high good humour, notwithstanding his announcement that he had spent a solitary afternoon, chafing at her absence. The period of solitude had been less irksome than he allowed. She leaned against the rail of the stoep near his chair, and gave an account of her afternoon's doings, which had been fairly dull on the whole....", "...conserved that instead of the usual dry pot-roast it is moist and tender and so well worth the trouble.

'Twas morn--to begin at the beginning--and Jackson sprang from his little cot to embark on the labours of the day.

As she reached the gate she caught sight of a light-brown head in one of the third-story windows across the street, and acting on a sudden impulse she made a signal.

Never mind, of course, if you are busy.\" \"Thank you, I am not busy; I'll come,\" and in two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Ikey was beside her.

But the ripples instantly cease, and on the surface of the water you see the long thin track of a broad back and huge dorsal fin.

You feel inclined to throw your fly-book bodily at the heads of the trout and bid them take their choice of its contents. That method of angling would be quite as successful as angling for large southern trout in the northern manner.

I decided to seize the opportunity to secure an interview with one who at least would be able to give me some satisfaction. I moved smartly towards the door. The sentry lowered his rifle, but I evaded the bayonet, I saw a flash and then all was darkness. Some time later I woke up. I was lying at full length upon the floor and my head was singing like a kettle, while it ached fearfully.

I went up with a guy, saw in three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he couldn't fly, took the controls away from him, landed, and told him to come back some other day. He pleaded with me that I hadn't given him a chance, that if I would only let him go further through the test without taking the controls away he would show me he could fly. So I took him up again. I let him slop along without interference until we came to spins. I told him to do a spin, and he started a steep spiral. I took the controls away from him, regained some altitude,...", "...Bird.

Water and land and sky started into new glories at the touch of the rising sun. The many-hilled city took on the hues of a fairy picture, and the windows gleamed with the magic fires that were flashed back in greeting to the god of day. The few cotton-ball clouds that lingered about the mountain-tops, sole stragglers of the army that had trooped up from the south at the blast of the rain-wind, turned from pink to white. The green-gray waters of the bay rippled...", "...watching all this anxiously, wondered that although the Red Squirrel's army was still fighting it was making no headway. He wondered how this could be. Suddenly he remembered the leaf in his pocket. At once he chewed it, and he then saw the reason for the squirrels' defeat.

Raising him up, she placed him beside her, and there they talked about the past and its pleasant recollections. How the cross miller, who had never been known to do a kindness to any one else, had sometimes let them ride upon his horse--how they had once rowed together about the bay, and he had taken her aboard his ship--how she had stolen away from home each pleasant evening to meet him, and with what feeble excuses--and...", "...and held his head between them until Connie was mounted. Then the ropes were released and the blindfold jerked away. \"Yip-ee!\" yelled Lefty, jumping aside. \"Ride 'im, Connie!\" For an instant Firewater stood perfectly still. Then he ducked his head, shot up into the air and came down stiff-legged. At every jump he seemed to go a little higher and strike the ground harder. Connie's slender little body whipped back and forth as she waved her hat and used her rowels. But after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Firewater stopped bucking and the girl rode him off across the sage. She came back flushed and triumphant. \"Nice work,\" praised Lefty as she slid to the ground. \"Lefty, I've been thinking over what you said about the rodeo,\" Connie declared slowly. \"Do you really believe I'd have any chance to win that prize for bronco riding?\" \"I sure do, Connie. No girl around here would have a chance against you, unless maybe it might be Enid Bradshaw.\" \"I could use five hundred...", "...light shed by a small lamp, which stood on the table before the sofa. From somewhere out of the dusk that lay beyond, a white figure rose and came towards him. Louise was in a crumpled dressing-gown, and her hair was loosened from its coil on her neck. Maurice saw so much, before she was close beside him, her eyes searching his face. \"Oh, you have come,\" she said with a sigh, as if a load had been lifted from her mind. \"I thought you were not coming.\" \"I only got your note a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago. I ... I came at once,\" he said, and stammered, as he saw how greatly illness had changed her. \"I knew you would.\" She did not give him her hand, but stood gazing at him; and her look was so helpless and forlorn that he grew uncomfortable. \"You have been ill?\" he said, to render the pause that followed less embarrassing. \"Yes; but I'm better now.\" She supported herself on the table; her indecision seemed to increase, and several seconds passed before she said:...", "...If God was waiting to meet us, and to give us blessing and power from heaven for His work, it was a short-sighted policy to put other work in the place which God and waiting on Him should have. At one of our ministerial meetings, the superintendent of a large district put the case thus: \"I rise in the morning and have half an hour with God, in the Word and prayer, in my room before breakfast. I go out, and am occupied all day with a multiplicity of engagements. I do not think many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> elapse without my breathing a prayer for guidance or help. After my day's work, I return in my evening devotions and speak to God of the day's work. But of the intense, definite, importunate prayer of which Scripture speaks one knows little.\" What, he asked, must I think of such a life?

Ah, I wasn't rightly under it. Yo! heave-o!\" Up went the door with a crash, and the soft moonlight streamed in upon them. A few seconds more and they stood outside the hut--apparently the only living beings in all that region, which had been so full of human life but a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before. \"Now we must lose no time in getting away from this place, and covering as much of the desert as we can during the night,\" said Miles, \"for it strikes me that we'll have to lie quiet during the day, for fear of being seen and chased.\" They spoke together in whispers for a few minutes, deciding the course they meant to pursue. Then Molloy shouldered the provision bag, Miles grasped his official lance--the only weapon they had among them,--and off they set on their...", "...Blackton had evidently been carefully drilled along the line of a certain scheme which Peggy had formed, for in spite of a negative nod from her, which signified that he was to wait a while, he pulled out his watch, and said: \"It isn't at all surprising if you people have forgotten that to-morrow is Sunday.

I'm afraid you will be displeased with me, Joanne. I hardly know how to begin. But--I've got to.\" A moment's uneasiness came into her eyes as she saw how seriously he was...", "...Still we would not despair. We had assured our anxious friends that we were quite able to take care of ourselves. We would triumphantly prove our own words. Breakfast over, and our bill settled without mishap or misunderstanding, we started for the station in the hotel omnibus, in company with a stout, genial Frenchman, who spoke a little English, and his fussy little wife. When we entered the station, the line formed before the ticket-window was already formidable. It lacked fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of the hour when the train would start, and our baggage was--where? We seized a _commissionaire_, slipped a piece of money into his hand in a very bungling, shamefaced way, and, presto! in a moment our trunks appeared among the other baggage, though we had looked in vain for them before. Then, with a sensation of self-consciousness approaching guilt, I stepped to the foot of the line before the ticket-window. \"Two tickets for Paris,\" I gasped, finding myself, after a time,...", "...the poor Devil of all his illustrious subjects, from Adam to John the Baptist.

Such witnesses, so loose in statement and so contradictory of each other, would collapse in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in any court of law. They do not write as spectators, and they were not spectators. What they give us is the legendary and mythical story that had taken possession of the Christian mind long after all the contemporaries of Jesus were dead.

Even professed Christians are giving up the miraculous elements of the gospels. But who would give up the...", "...of the government --a war without a battle! There was, perhaps, no genuine basis of necessity upon which to organize the expensive and disastrous expedition against the Mormons. The real cause, perhaps, should be attributed to the clamour of other religious sects against what they held to be an unorthodox belief. The City of Salt Lake, the capital of the Mormon settlement, was founded upon the arrival of that sect in the valley in 1847. It is situated in latitude 40 degrees 46 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> north, and longitude 112 degrees 6 minutes west, (from Greenwich), at the foot of the western slope of the Wahsatch Mountains, an extensive chain of lofty hills, forming a portion of the eastern boundary of what is known in our geography as the Great Basin.

The corporate limits aggregate about fifty...", "...and I had never seen a donkey alone there before. There was something strange-looking about it. Evidently it has strayed, I thought, and must just stray back again. But with my love for animals I could not help stopping and watching. It came straight up to me, and put its nose into my hand, just as if it knew me. 'Where have you come from?' I said, patting its head. 'Your owner will be anxious. You must go straight home.' But there it stood, and there I stood; and for at least five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we never moved. \"Then I felt it was ridiculous, and set off home. Will you believe, senor, that the animal followed me like a dog. I could not get rid of it. When I arrived home the donkey arrived with me. What could I do? There was an empty stable next door, and I put it in there, thinking it would be claimed and perhaps I should get a small reward. The animal went in just as if the stable had been always its home.

Augustus then remained there for another hour, but not a word was said between the young men on that subject which was nearest, at the moment, to the hearts of both of them. Each was thinking of Madeline, but neither of them spoke as though any such subject were in their thoughts. \"Heaven and earth!\" said Augustus at last, pulling out his watch. \"It only wants three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to seven.

For a long time she sat alone, and faced what seemed to her inevitable darkness, then suddenly she started to her feet.

She was allowing a poor and unworthy vanity to stand between her and happiness. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later she was on her way to the Manor Farm. There had been a battle between love and pride, and love had won. She believed that not only her happiness, but his was at stake. She almost flew across the park, so eager was she to reach him. Pride was gone, the fear of what the world might think, if the world knew, was gone. She only knew that she loved, and that she would, if needs be, plead for forgiveness.

Still she glanced round as she issued from the cottage, hoping that her escort would not be in sight, and they would happen to miss each other. She wanted time to think, to ponder over new possibilities suggested by her old nurse's words, possibilities which seemed to her, numbed by her long battle royal to overcome her passion...", "...One would suppose that two people who are to pass their whole lives together, and must necessarily be very often alone with each other, could find little pleasure in mutual contradiction; and yet what is more common than a contradictory couple?

After Cyanaea capillata has been allowed to soak for ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or so in a weak sea-water solution of strychnia, unmistakable signs of irregularity in the pulsations supervene. This irregularity then increases more and more, till at length it grows into well-marked convulsions.

Afterwards he told me that a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before the storm broke he saw a particularly dense black cloud coming up upon us out of the southeast, where it had apparently been lying in ambush for us behind the northernmost headland of the Gulf of Guinea, an ambush so successful that even the barometer failed to detect it, for when Mate Isitt ran to the chart-room he found that the instrument showed no fall.

At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment.

Upon this, first a general distrust of the telegrams from the mine itself was manifested, and then literally in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a panic set in, as unaccountable as the previous rise; business came to a standstill, for in half an hour everyone was wanting to sell Carmel, and buyers could not be found.

Perhaps Athos was dreaming. The day passed away. Blaisois' son returned: the courier had brought no news. The comte reckoned the minutes with despair; he shuddered when those <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had formed an hour. The idea that he was forgotten seized him once, and brought on a fearful pang of the heart. Everybody in the house had given up all hopes of the courier--his hour had long passed. Four times the express sent to Blois had reiterated his journey, and there was nothing to the address of the comte. Athos knew that the courier only arrived once a week.

Once he got angry and suddenly gave it a tremendous cuff with his paw; in his bearing he had something half humorous, half devilish.

Now, this theory applies to those things, exclusive of the category of \"unique values,\" which cannot be made by labor and are commonly supposed to owe their value to their rarity.

As he stoops to drink, he sees in the water a number of glittering diamonds. To pick them out is the work of a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> only, but the diamonds are worth many thousands of dollars. The law of value above outlined applies just as much to them as to any other commodity. The value of diamonds is determined by the amount of labor expenditure necessary _on an average_ to procure them.

Since he was then on the eve of going to New York to carry letters to General Clinton, it is not likely he is among those in the beleaguered city of Yorktown.\" \"I have been so glad to think this,\" Betty answered, sighing. \"Do you know, Joscelyn, I saw him in the parlour yonder for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the day the British marched?\" \"Yes; I told mother to have you here, and then I sent him back from headquarters.\" Betty kissed her gratefully. \"I might have guessed it. It was such a happy ten minutes! But, Joscelyn, mother never mentions his name except to remind me that his father and mine were bitter enemies.\" \"Wait until Richard comes home; he doubtless will look at matters differently; and as he says, so will your mother do.\" \"Not unless you plead for me; and even...", "...artillery. Word came, \"Stanley's left is turned.\" And so instantly Howard rode to a group of mounted officers. Here were Hooker, Thomas and Sherman together. \"What is it, Howard?\" asked Thomas anxiously. \"I want a division at once for my left.\" \"General Hooker will give you one.\" \"Yes,\" said Hooker, \"Williams' Division is right there.\" Colonel Morgan, of Howard's staff, in less than five minutes was guiding Williams' brave men in quick time, to the threatened flank. In less than fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Hood's masses were running back for cover to his fortified ground. This was the crisis. Prompt action and fearless men saved the left from impending disaster.\" The Union armies pressed forward as rapidly as possible, along roads on which the dust lay a foot deep. The heat was intense and the men suffered greatly. On the afternoon of the 17th the advance guards struck the rear guard of the enemy at Adairsville, and had a sharp skirmish. Here, between 4 and 5 P. M., Howard and...", "...other territory,\" suggested Hiram. \"We want to be on the lookout for that,\" replied the young aviator. They made themselves a comfortable bed, and both were soon asleep. Hiram woke up first; and found the sun shining in his eyes, and was about to shift his position, intent on a longer nap, when he checked himself not moving a muscle. Through his half closed eyelids, still feigning sleep, Hiram kept his glance fixed on one spot. He almost held his breath. Thus for nearly five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he lay inert, but every nerve on the keenest edge. His glance widened and seemed to be following some disappearing object. Then he sat straight upright, stared fixedly down the hill, and leaning over pulled his companion by the sleeve. \"Dave! Dave!\" whispered the excited boy-\"wake up! We've been discovered!\" CHAPTER XXI A CHASE IN MID AIR Dave roused up, wide awake in an instant. He was about to spring to his feet, when Hiram pulled him back with the...", "...and in less than a year it will be fit to bottle. _Stomach Bitters, equal to Hostetter's, for one-fourth its cost._--European Gentian root, 1-1/2 ounce; orange peel, 2-1/2 ounces; cinnamon, 1/4 ounce; aniseseed, 1/2 ounce; coriander seed, 1/2 ounce; cardamon seed, 1/8 ounce; unground Peruvian bark, 1/2 ounce; gum kino, 1/4 ounce; bruise all these articles, and put them into the best alcohol, 1 pint; let it stand a week and pour off the clear tincture: then boil the dregs a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in 1 quart of water, strain, and press out all the strength; now dissolve loaf sugar, 1 pound, in the hot liquid, adding 3 quarts cold water, and mix with spirit tincture first poured off, or you can add these, and let it stand on the dregs if preferred. _Soda Syrup, with or without Fountains._--The common or more watery syrups are made by using loaf or crushed sugar, 8 pounds; pure water, 1 gallon, gum arabic, 2 ounces, mix in a brass or copper kettle; boil until the gum is...", "...streamed from a mass of clouds in the west, which resembled some old feudal castle in flames; and the fiery furzes of the sunset only made the blackness of the mass more palpable. Then this light gradually disappeared: a murky gloom settled down upon the conflagration, as of dying fires at midnight, and a cool wind from the mountains rose and died away, and rose again, and swept along in gusts, and shook the trees, making them grate and moan. Verty rose to his feet. \"In five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we shall have a storm,\" he said. \"Come, Redbud--and Miss Fanny.\" Even as he spoke, the far distance pushed a blinding mass toward them, and a dozen heavy drops began to fall. \"We cannot get back!\" cried Ralph. \"But we can reach the house at the foot of the hill!\" said Fanny. \"No time to lose!\" And so saying, Verty took Redbud's hand, and leaving Fanny to Ralph, hastened down the hill. Before they had gone twenty steps, the thunder gust burst on them furiously....", "...and I couldn't.\" \"Moral!\" Vance said sententiously. They had been moving slowly down to the young man, who now gave them a nod of welcome, and began to air his rather lame English. The nurse brought out the baby, a charming child of four, and Laverne's face lighted up with joy. \"You are fond of babies,\" said the mother, in a glad tone. \"Oh, yes, and there are so few of them, except the dirty street children.\" \"Where is Lena?\" asked Olive. \"One can never tell for five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> where she is,\" said the mother. \"I'm going to hunt her up; she's such fun.\" But Olive went no further than the group shaded by the passion vine, and the four were in the midst of something amusing, to judge by their merry laughs. \"Why, I didn't know Alvarado could be so gay,\" declared Victor. \"He doesn't talk very well, and last night I hardly knew how to entertain him. His father is to send him North to one of the cities in the autumn. We need some of this work here,...", "...whole town should join with you in laughing.\" This would have been real courage. Henry would have seen, at once, that it would do no good to laugh at a boy who had so bold a heart. You must have this fearless spirit, or you will get into trouble, and will be, and ought to be, disliked by all. LESSON LIII. THE OLD CLOCK. 1. In the old, old hall the old clock stands, And round and round move the steady hands; With its tick, tick, tick, both night and day, While seconds and <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> pass away. 138 ECLECTIC SERIES, 2. At the old, old clock oft wonders Nell, For she can't make out what it has to tell; She has ne'er yet read, in prose or rhyme, That it marks the silent course of time. 3. When I was a child, as Nell is now, And long ere Time had wrinkled my brow, The old, old clock both by night and day Said,--\"Tick, tick, tick!\" Time passes away. THIRD READER. 139 LESSON LIV. THE WAVES. 1. \"Where are we to go?\" said the little...", "...stepped foot upon the bridge and commenced the perilous journey. I followed close at his heels, and when we reached the spot which was the scene of his experience in the bog, the slime and water had filled up the hole which his body made, and all looked hard and treacherous as ever. Mr. Brown pointed to the spot with his hand as he passed, but he neither turned nor made remark, although I thought I saw his form tremble at the recollection of his danger. We were not more than two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in reaching the end of the bridge, and then we again paused to reconnoitre. Nothing to alarm us was to be seen, and we again ventured forward, this time with more confidence than we had felt since we had started. \"Your ghost has fled,\" I said, in a half whisper. At that instant, as though to disprove my words, we heard a sharp, quick blow, that sounded like an iron shovel struck upon stones. We uttered no word, or made the least noise, but we turned our looks upon the...", "...William to another long survey. \"When next you come a-hentering of this 'ouse, my boy,\" he said, \"kindly remember that the front door is reserved for gentry an' the back for brats.\" William merely looked at him coldly over a hunk of bread and butter. Mentally he knocked him off the list of nugget-receivers. The butler looked sadly round the room. \"They're all the same,\" he lamented. \"Eat, eat, eat. Nothin' but eat. Eat all day an' eat all night. 'E's not bin in the 'ouse two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> an' 'e's at it. Eat! eat! eat! 'E'll 'ave all the buttons bust off his uniform in a week like wot the larst one 'ad. Like eatin' better than workin', don't you?\" he said sarcastically to William. \"Yes, I do, too,\" said William with firm conviction. The kitchen-maid giggled again, and the housemaid gave a sigh expressive of scorn and weariness as she drew a thin pencil over her eyebrows. \"Well, if you've quite finished, my lord,\" said the butler in ponderous irony, \"I'll...", "...the Checkers of the Hope. A solitary light burned in one of the lower windows of the old inn, but no sound of revelry issued from its doors. Leaving it behind him, Bax soon found himself standing within a few yards of the tombstone of the ill-fated Mary whose name he bore. \"Poor thing, 'twas a sad fate!\" he murmured, as he contemplated the grave of the murdered girl, who had been a cousin of his own grandfather. \"Poor Mary, you're at rest now, which is more than I am.\" For some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Bax stood gazing dreamily at the grave which was barely visible in the faint light afforded by a few stars that shone through the cloudy sky. Suddenly he started, and every fibre of his strong frame was shaken with horror as he beheld the surface of the grave move, and saw, or fancied he saw, a dim figure raise itself partially from the earth. Bax was no coward in any sense of that word. Many brave men there are who, although quite fearless in regard to danger and death,...", "...as the four runners were about to pass our hiding place--\"Now!\" What I did had to be done on the spur of the moment. At the climaxing instant, I flung my arms around him and dragged him down and held him helpless; at which it was only natural that he should fall to cursing me like a fishwife. \"You fool!\" I panted, when I had the breath to spare. \"Let them go! They'll come back. Don't you hear that wind coming? The yacht will be lost if she hangs on outside of that reef five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> longer!\" As I let him get up, a hurtling volley of great raindrops tore through the foliage over our heads, and a blast, carrying with it the dank, unwholesome breath of an upheaved watery underworld, swept across the surface of the lagoon. Like mad-men the racing four hurled themselves into the waiting yawl, the boat shoved off, and with the men at the oars pulling with much more energy than skill, a frantic dash was made for the passage through the reef. It bade fair to...", "...forget your part, the Marseilles _Gazette_. It's a good republican paper. The editor's a great friend of mine.\" \"I'm afraid I sha'n't be a credit to the profession. I've never seen any one interviewed in my life.\" \"Then it'll be an education to you.\" Durand laughed. \"Look out. Here he comes!\" The fat little manager approached them with a smiling face; he evidently had in mind two free advertisements for the theatre. \"Mademoiselle Blanche,\" he said impressively, \"arrived five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago, and she hasn't begun to dress yet. If you'll have the kindness to follow me, messieurs\"--he concluded with a bow and a wave of the hand. Jules' body was tingling, and his heart beat violently. Durand, on the contrary, seemed more debonair than ever; with an air of importance, he strutted behind the manager, as if conferring an honor on the performer by his call. Reju rapped on the door, and after a moment a shrill voice piped:...", "...at all,\" I answered, turning away. \"In fact, the less I have to do with it the better.\" We entered the hotel and, crossing the hall, rang for the lift. The lift came to a standstill at the third floor and we stepped out on to the corridor. The Count's servant followed me to my room, deposited the box on a chair at the foot of the bed and wished me good-night. I then got into bed and, full of excitement though the day had been for me, slept soundly till morning. It was five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past nine when I entered the great salon of the hotel and looked round for Lord Langerdale. My search was not a long one. He was sitting alone at a table laid for three in one of the deep recesses, with a little pile of letters and a newspaper before him. Directly he saw me he pushed them away and held out his hand. \"Good-morning!\" he said pleasantly. \"I'm glad to see you're so punctual. You're not in a hurry for breakfast for a few minutes, are you?\" \"Not at all,\" I...", "...tigers really assault us?\" \"What shall we do indeed?\" was my thought. \"Takur Gulab-Lal-Sing is not here to protect us.\" Our Hindu companions sat on the carpet after their oriental fashion, quietly chewing betel. On being asked their opinion, they said they would not interfere with our decision, and were ready to do exactly as we liked. But as for the European portion of our party, there was no use concealing the fact that we were frightened, and we speedily prepared to start. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later we mounted the elephants, and, in a quarter of an hour, just when the sun disappeared behind the mountain and heavy darkness instantaneously fell, we passed the gate of Akbar and descended into the valley. We were hardly a quarter of a mile from our abandoned camping place when the cypress grove resounded with shrieking howls of jackals, followed by a well-known mighty roar. There was no longer any possibility of doubting. The tigers were disappointed at our escape....", "...think? Let's grab a cab and get going.\" Nobody had come out of the tube exit behind her. Kilby nodded understandingly; she had remembered not to look back. She was talking volubly about some imaginary adventure as they started down the terrace stairs towards a line of aircabs, playing her part, high-piled golden hairdo bobbing about. A greater contrast to the slender, quiet, gray-eyed girl, brown hair falling softly to her shoulders, with whom Halder had talked not more than twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago would have been difficult to devise. The disguises might have been good enough, he thought, to permit them to remain undetected in Draise itself. But the plan didn't call for that. There were too many things at stake. Kilby slipped into the cab ahead of him without a break in her chatter. Her voice stopped abruptly as Halder closed the cab door behind him, activating the vehicle's one-way vision shield. Kilby was leaning across the front seat beside the driver,...", "...rested on the mug from which the child had taken his supper of bread and milk. \"Poor little fellow!\" came from his lips, in a tone of pity. Then he sat down by the table and leaned his head on his hand. His face was toward the corner of the room where the child lay. He still fumbled the small coins in his pocket, but after a while his fingers ceased to play with them, then his hand was slowly withdrawn from the pocket, a deep sigh accompanying the act. After the lapse of several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he took up the candle, and going over to the bed, crouched down and let the light fall on Andy's face. The large forehead, soiled as it was, looked white to the man's eyes, and the brown matted hair, as he drew it through his fingers, was soft and beautiful. Memory had taken him back for years, and he was looking at the fair forehead and touching the soft brown hair of another baby. His eyes grew dim. He set the candle upon the floor, and putting his hands over his face, sobbed...", "...He refused to imagine. He beat a tattoo with the inane hook which summons Central. \"Number does n't answer, sir,\" came the reply. \"They _must_ answer! You must _make_ them answer.\" Again the interminable wait; again the dead reply. He hung up the receiver. The hallucinations which swarmed through his brain taken in connection with the meaningless talk of the hotel employees made him fear an instant for his sanity. He sat down on the edge of the bed and devoted five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to the concentration of his mind upon the fact that he must be cool, must be steady. Else he would be of no use to any one. He must be deliberate. Then he dressed himself with complete self-possession. When he came down into the lobby he noticed with some astonishment the business-like appearance of the place for Sunday morning. The clerk glanced at him curiously as he approached. Donaldson spoke with exaggerated slowness and precision. \"I wish,\" he said, \"that you...", "...| 1 51.4| 1 54.8 60|1 58.3|2 01.8|2 05.8|2 09.9|2 14.5| 2 19.14| 2 24.7| 2 30.5| 2 36.8| 2 43.8 70|2 51.3|2 59.8|3 09.1|3 19.6|3 31.3| 3 44.6 | 3 59.8| 4 17.1| 4 37.4| 5 01.1 80|5 29.5|6 03 |6 46.4|7 40.3|8 51.1|10 27.7 |12 47.9|16 29.6|23 14.3|39 42.2 --+------+------+------+------+------+--------+-------+-------+-------+------- _Use of the table._--Find the required parallel; the tens at the side, and the units at the top.

Presently he heard Martin leave the room and hurry downstairs. The poor boy was dazed and bewildered by the rough treatment he had received. For some time he sat where he had been placed, not daring to move for fear his tormentor would come back and finish his evil work. \"There is something behind it all,\" he thought, dismally. \"Martin is doing this for some purpose. What can that purpose be?\" Ralph did not brood over the mystery long. As the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed slowly by and Martin did not come back, the youth began to speculate on the chances of escape. \"If I could only get free of these cords I might burst open the door,\" he thought. \"Let me see what I can do.\" Ralph struggled manfully, but it availed him but little. He was no great contortionist, and his efforts resulted only in a painful laceration of his wrists and ankles. Martin had done his work well, and the bonds could not be severed without outside aid. Five...", "...admiringly. Without more ado the boys fell to work on their task. They cut the holes about ten feet apart. It was hard work, but they stuck to it perseveringly, and at last, from the two holes, two columns of black smoke spouted up. Luckily for their plans the wind had, by this time, moderated so much as to have fallen almost flat. High into the heavens soared the two black columns of smoke like two pillars of inky vapor. Every eye watched the distant yacht anxiously. For five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the anxiety was so intense that no one spoke. The pitch of expectancy was painful. Then came a great cry. \"They've seen our signal!\" shouted Rob. \"Yes; look, she's changing her course. Look at the black smoke coming from her funnel. She's making top speed to our rescue!\" cried Merritt. \"Let's hope that she won't be too late,\" murmured the ensign under his breath, and then aloud he cried: \"Three cheers for the Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol!\" CHAPTER IX....", "...and she consenting, I went by river to my lodging in Whitehall, where I collected a few necessary articles in a bag and returned quickly as possible to the Old Swan. When I reached George's room, I found Betty at her post. The physician had given Hamilton a quieting potion, and he was resting, though at intervals he broke out, shouting his intention to kill the king. During nearly two weeks Hamilton lay moaning and raving, sweet, dear Betty rarely leaving his side for more than a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at a time. I, too, clung to my post faithfully, but at least a part of my motive in doing so was selfish, being the joy I found in Betty's company. At the end of two weeks George began to recover rapidly, and I was dismissed along with the physician. When I returned to Whitehall, I found that my Lord Sandwich, under whom I held my place as Second Gentleman of the Wardrobe, had been seeking me. The king had gone to Sheerness on business of the navy two weeks before, and the...", "...\"Why?\" enquired Mr. Triggs. \"I happen to know,\" continued Mrs. Bonsor, \"that Arthur is very anxious for some work that Miss Brent is doing for him.\" \"What work?\" enquired Mr. Triggs. \"Oh--er--something about----\" Mrs. Bonsor looked appealingly at Patricia; but Patricia had no intention of helping her out. \"Well! if you can't remember what it is, it can't matter much, and I've set my mind on going to the Zoo this afternoon.\" \"Very well, father. If you will wait a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I will go with you myself.\" \"You!\" exclaimed Mr. Triggs in consternation. \"You and me at the Zoo!

Evarts repeated the answer for Thornton's benefit, looking at their own clock at the same time. It pointed to exactly forty seconds past the hour. He heard Thornton suppress something like an oath. \"There's something the matter!\" repeated Thornton dumbly. \"Aeta isn't within five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of crossing. Both clocks can't be wrong!\" He pressed a button that connected with the wireless room. \"What's the time?\" he called sharply through the nickel-plated speaking-tube. \"Forty-five seconds past the hour,\" came the answer. Then: \"But I want to see you, sir. There's something queer going on. May I come in?\" \"Come!\" almost shouted Thornton. A moment later the flushed face of Williams, the night operator, appeared in the doorway. \"Excuse me, sir,\" he...", "...mountain side. It was all so quickly done that he blinked back at the sun in a daze as though awaking from some evil dream. But his uncomfortable position soon assured him that it was a reality and he settled into a sullen rage. He had been captured as easily as a drunken sailor is shanghaied. They never paused until they lowered him like a bundle of hay within a dozen feet of where he had tethered his burros. Instantly he heard a familiar voice jabbering with his captors.

I felt that it was now or never, and the order went down for every pound of steam and full speed. Thus we rounded Cape Rawson, and Cape Sheridan was in view. At last! That sloping headland looked more beautiful than the gates of paradise to our vigil-wearied eyes. We rounded the cape at a quarter past seven, fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later than the time of our arrival in 1905. Since the 23d of August, thirteen days before, neither Bartlett nor I had had our clothes off. Should we stop here? There was still open water beyond. I gave orders to steam ahead, hoping that we might reach Porter Bay. But after two miles we came to another impassable barrier of ice, and it was decided that it was Cape Sheridan again for this year's winter quarters. Back we went, and the work of getting the _Roosevelt_ inside the...", "...will get out all right. There is nothing to get excited about.\" These words had almost a magical effect. In reality, there was quite enough in the situation to excite anyone, but Al's apparent calmness and his assertion that the danger did not amount to anything produced just the result he desired. The crowd became more rational, and to make a long story short, within three minutes the building was emptied, even of the women and children who had fainted or been injured. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the roof of the building fell in, but there was every reason to believe that not a single human life had been sacrificed. Al started for his hotel as quietly as if nothing unusual had happened. But he had gone only a few steps when he was overtaken by Mr. Wattles. To his astonishment, the manager folded him in his arms, exclaiming: \"By Jove! I wish you were my son!\" \"What's the matter now?\" asked the boy, disengaging himself. \"Matter? Why, the matter is that you...", "...the night became darker and the lightning brighter. The framework of our shelter rocked to and fro in the gale and we felt as if upon the sea; the straw and the hay jumped up as if alive, and great lumps of thatch were rent out of the roof, showing the sky and letting in the rain. I looked for the ruin of our shelter. But the hurricane passed on. The rain came in its place. The great forty-day flood re-accomplished itself in an hour. We heard the beat of the rain on the earth: in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> it was the hiss of the rain on the flooded meadows. By the sulphurous illuminations we saw almost continuously the close-packed, drenching rain.... The wet came in. We burrowed deep down into the straw and slept like some new sort of animal.

The bridge is a favourite resort of the Russian tramp and pilgrim, and I have often come...", "...the heat does not penetrate to the yolk until the last minute, and consequently the white is hard and the yolk hardly cooked enough.

Several years had elapsed since we had met, but he began to talk as if we had parted only a few hours before. At first I thought his mind was impaired by age, and that he had forgotten how long it was since we had spoken together. I imagined it possible that he mistook me for some one else; but very soon I found that his memory was not at fault, for in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he began to question me about old friends in America, and to ask for information concerning the probable sea-sick horrors of an Atlantic voyage. \"I suppose,\" said he, \"knowing your infirmity, you found it hard work to stand on your immaterial legs, as Hood used to call Lamb's quivering limbs.\" Sauntering out into the street, he went on in a quaintly humorous way to imagine what a rough voyage must be to a real sufferer, and thus walking gayly along, we came into Leadenhall...", "...he crossed the room, fumbled open the sideboard door, and took out the bottle. Reaching over the polished oak, he grasped a sherry glass; and holding the bottle with both hands, tipped the liquor into it, put it to his lips and sucked. Drop by drop it passed over his palate mild, very old, old as himself, coloured like sunlight, fragrant. To the last drop he drank it, then hugging the bottle to his shirt-front, he moved snail-like to his chair, and fell back into its depths. For some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he remained there motionless, the bottle clasped to his chest, thinking: 'This is not the attitude of a gentleman. I must put it down on the table-on the table;' but a thick cloud was between him and everything. It was with his hands he would have to put the bottle on the table! But he could not find his hands, could not feel them.

There are Indian princes who regularly consult their fortune-tellers regarding public and private affairs. A curious bathing fair was held at Ajudhia, in Oude, in February 1878. When a peculiar conjunction of the planets takes place (which occurs only once in eighty years), the natives rush in crowds to the river, as they believe that if they manage to bathe and go through certain ceremonies in four <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and a half, they will obtain the remission of their own sins and those of millions of their ancestors. On this occasion the rush to the river turned out so great that numbers were trodden under foot, and sixty-five persons lost their lives. The mysterious lights in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which are believed by mariners to be warnings of great tempests and shipwreck, were unusually brilliant in 1878. It is said to be a fact, established by the experience of a century, that...", "...move the pillow, or do anything to relieve her, she replied, 'There is nothing for it but quiet.' At six, she said, 'I must get up and have some mint tea.' I then called for Turpin, and felt my angel's pulse: it was fluttering; and by that I knew I should soon lose her. She took the tea well. Turpin began to put on her clothes, and was proceeding to dress her, when she laid her head upon the faithful creature's shoulder, became convulsed in the face, spoke not, looked not, and in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> expired.\" [173] And, in allusion to this circumstance, the house afterwards raised on a neighbouring spot, at this time suggested by Miss Smith, received the name of Tent Lodge.

The mist has now cleared away from the peak, but lies all over the lower world, and I take bearings of the three highest cones or peaks carefully. Then I go away over the rocky ground southwards, and as I stand looking round, the mist sea below is cleft in twain for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> by some fierce down-draught of wind from the peak, and I get a strange, clear, sudden view right down to Ambas Bay. It is just like looking down from one world into another. I think how Odin hung and looked down into Nifelheim, and then of how hot, how deliciously hot, it was away down there, and then the mist closes over it. I shiver and go back to camp, for night is coming on, and I know my men will require intellectual support in the matter of procuring firewood.

They was two funny-lookin' old birds, too--I'll say they was. They was about a hundred years old apiece and had long white whiskers like St. Peter, and, say, they talked a whole lot more than they dug. I guess they musta been workin' on that grave for a coupla weeks--you know, ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> _parlez-vous_ and then one shovela dirt.

I went towards them across the big room, apologizing for my unpunctuality, for I was nearly ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> late. To my surprise they remained silent; even Easterton did not rise, or greet me in any way. He looked strangely serious, and so did Jack, as a rule the cheeriest of mortals. \"I am dreadfully sorry for being so late,\" I exclaimed, thinking that my unpunctuality must have given them offence. I was about to invent some elaborate excuse to account for my \"delay,\" when the man seated with his back to me suddenly rose, and, turning abruptly, faced me. I recognized him at...", "...a large silver-gilt mace (1661), silver loving-cup (1719), silver oar and silver-gilt ornaments (typical of the Admiralty jurisdiction of the Corporation) (1748), two small maces of silver (1767), sword (1871--the Mayor being Constable of the Castle), and chain and badges of gold and enamel (1875), the last-mentioned commemorating many historical incidents connected with the city. Emerging from the railway station of the London, Chatham and Dover Company at Strood, a drive of a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> (over the bridge) brings us to the first object of our pilgrimage, the \"Bull Inn,\"--we beg pardon, the \"Royal Victoria and Bull Hotel,\"--in High Street, Rochester, which was visited by Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Tupman, Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Winkle, and their newly-made friend, Mr. Jingle, on the 13th May, 1827. Our cabman is so satisfied with his fare (\"only a bob's worth\"), that he does not, as one of his predecessors did, on a very remarkable occasion, \"fling the money on the pavement,...", "...who must have been a tanner, I should say. \"It will do,\" I declared. \"Yes, but will you bring the coffin here?\" \"Assuredly.\" \"Not for a pound a day, though, mister!\" she retorted with a cunning smile. \"Why, all my boarders would clear out!\" \"How much do you want, then?\" \"Two quid, not a penny less.\" I paid the money into her hand. Her eyes glinted with rage and self-contempt, because she had not demanded three, but I did not choose to heed. \"I shall return in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with the coffin!\" I said quickly. \"In the meanwhile that room is mine. Please see that no one goes into it, and do not on any account open the window!\" In another moment I was out of the house, and walking back briskly towards the city, followed at a distance by the greengrocer's cart. The undertaker's shop was half a mile away. I reached it in less than four minutes, and entered with the air of a busy bourgeois. \"How much that box?\" I asked of the proprietor, pointing to...", "...the waking world. Besides, lastly, the water in his bath, he could see, was frozen; and it was hopeless on a day like this to expect that Raffles would bring him sufficient hot, even to shave with. However, the tutor had had some little practice before now in doing what he did not like. With a sigh and a shiver, therefore, he flung aside his blankets and proceeded to break the ice literally, and take his bath. After that he felt decidedly better, and with the help of a steady ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> grind at the dumb-bells, he succeeded in pulling himself together. He had reached this stage in his toilet when a knock came at the door. \"Come in, Raffles,\" said Mr Armstrong, beginning to see some prospect of a shave after all. It was not Raffles, but Dr Brandram, equipped for the road. \"I'm off, Armstrong,\" said he. \"I'd ask you to come and drive me, only I think you are wanted here.

This loss he repaired by ingeniously contriving one of gold, silver, and wax, which was said to bear a good resemblance to the original. From Wittenberg Tycho proceeded to Augsburg, where he resided for two years. Here he made the acquaintance of several men distinguished for their learning and their love of astronomy. During his stay at Augsburg he constructed a quadrant of fourteen cubits radius, on which were indicated the single <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of a degree; he made many valuable observations with this instrument, which he used in combination with a large sextant. In 1571 Tycho returned to Denmark, where his fame as an astronomer had preceded him, and was the means of procuring for him a hearty welcome from his relatives and friends. In 1572, when returning one night from his laboratory--for Tycho studied alchemy as well as astronomy--he beheld what appeared to be a new and brilliant star in the constellation...", "...stood an hour before. Dick was the first to move; he touched Ned's arm. \"All is quiet here now, but they may take it into their heads to come back and search.

God has protected us thus far; let us pray that He will continue to do so.\" In another five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the little party, stealing cautiously out from their shelter, kept along close to the wall to a side door, through which they issued forth into the open. Ten steps took them to the cactus hedge, and stooping low under its shelter, they moved on till they safely reached the clump of trees. For some time the little party crouched among the thick bushes, the silence broken only by the sobs of the girls. Ned and Richard said nothing, but the tears fell fast down their cheeks. The...", "...He had been terribly cut up over Cabot's disappearance on the night of the blizzard, and, with the faithful Yim, had spent days in searching for him. They had gone back to the timber, only to find the Indian camp deserted, and that its recent occupants had made a hasty departure. Finally they had given over the hopeless search and had sadly continued their southward journey. Now to again behold Cabot alive and well filled poor White with such joyful amazement that for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he could not frame an intelligent sentence. He flew down to where the new arrival still struggled with his hauling gear, and flung himself so impulsively upon him that both rolled over in the snow. There, with gasping exclamations of delight, they wrestled themselves into a mood of comparative calmness that enabled them to regain their feet and begin to ask questions.

But the hours flew by, and still no orders came, until the Line became restless, and the fear grew that the fight would begin before we could reach the field of battle. The sun began to sink over the Heights of Harlem when an aide rode into our lines. It was Tench Tilghman, who swung his hat and shouted as he went by: \"You will have warm work in a day or two, boys!\" We gave him a yell in reply, and started with renewed interest the preparations for the coming fight. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later came the orders that we were to march at dawn. The men received the news joyfully, and it was wonderful to see the change in their bearing; for while the doubt hung over them, they were restless and murmuring was heard all through the camp; but now all was laughter and gaiety. They prepared for the fight as one would prepare for the next county ball or a fox-hunt on the morrow. The stirring notes of the bugle ringing over the camp brought me to my feet with a bound,...", "...fort on the Tennessee, I took a much larger one on the Cumberland, first defeating the enemy's army in a big battle, and now I am preparing to march on Nashville.

In two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he was asleep, but Dick, despite his weariness, had disturbed nerves which refused to let him sleep for a long time. He closed his eyes repeatedly, and then opened them again, merely to see the tethered horses, and beyond them the circle of sentinels, a clear moonlight falling on their rifle barrels. But it was very warm and cosy in the blankets, and he would soon fall asleep again. He was awakened about an hour after midnight to take his turn at the watch, and he noticed...", "...CHAPTER II SALLY TAKES CHARGE The night was clear and bitterly cold when Hawtrey and Sally Creighton drove away from Stukely's barn. Winter had lingered unusually long that year, and the prairie gleamed dimly white, with the sledge trail cutting athwart it, a smear of blue-gray in the foreground. It was--for Lander's lay behind them with the snow among the stubble belts that engirdled it--an empty wilderness that the mettlesome team swung across, and during the first few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the cold struck through the horses with a sting like the thrust of steel. A half moon, coppery red with frost, hung low above the snow-covered earth, and there was no sound but the crunch beneath the runners, and the beat of hoofs that rang dully through the silence like a roll of muffled drums. Sleighs like the one that Hawtrey drove are not common on the prairie, where the farmer generally uses the humble bob-sled when the snow lies unusually long. It had been made for use...", "...the first whisper of his name had upon the thieves who set out upon their travels for the evening? They're regular highwaymen, for a hundred,--up to everything, from stripping a priest of his vestment, to stealing a pinafore from a child. By the Lord!

But here's the old fellow of the inn,--I hope to tell us something about supper.\" The host announced the welcome tidings that in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> our repast should be paraded: and further added, that he was commissioned to inquire whether we would permit the two gentlemen who had remained in the kitchen, to join our company--and the host was ready, even upon oath, to guarantee their respectability. The lineage of the hidalgo was so ancient, that all traces of it were lost; and of the doctor, Fame spake loudly, as a personage who could do anything but raise the dead. To this double application I returned a gracious reply;...", "...to spread each sausage with it from end to end, patting them in a friendly way as she finished the operation. Next she sprinkled them with pepper, and after that she constructed a little pile of salt on the side of the plate, using her fingers to convey it from the salt-cellar. It remained to cut a thick slice of bread--she held the loaf pressed to her bosom whilst doing this--and to crush it down well into the black grease beside the sausages; then Clem was ready to begin. For five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she fed heartily, showing really remarkable skill in conveying pieces of sausage to her mouth by means of the knife alone. Finding it necessary to breathe at last, she looked round at Jane. The hand-maiden was on her knees near the fire, scrubbing very hard at the pan with successive pieces of newspaper. It was a sight to increase the gusto of Clem's meal, but of a sudden there came into the girl's mind a yet more delightful thought.

It feels sticky already.\" A brash jayee said: \"I saw it unsealed myself three minutes ago, Commander. It'll get stickier if we spend any more time talking. You have\"--he glanced at his chronometer--\"seventeen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> now. Let me snap you in.\" The Commander huddled down after a searching glance at the jayee's face which photographed it forever in his memory. The top snapped down. Some day--some happy day--that squirt would very much regret telling him off. He gave an okay sign to Van Dellen who waved back meagerly and managed a smile. Three crewmen fitted the capsule into its lock. Foomf! It was through the hatch and bobbing on the surface. Its color matched the water's...", "...and the way he talked out straight, and told the truth to shame the devil--it's what does a man good!

She was conscious in a nice, sympathetic way that her hand had been taken, but it was lost in the abstraction of her emotion. \"Oh, here, let it go...", "...and we could discern a symmetrical arrangement. The sun was surrounded by a ring, the lower portion of which was broken by an inverted arc; two other arcs were visible on either side. A large ring appeared encircling the zenith, intersecting the first and passing through the sun. Two pairs of arcs were also seen, one pair in each ring. Excepting the arcs and ring about the zenith, which was grayish-white against the blue sky, the arcs showed prismatic colouring. The display lasted ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and ended with the disappearance of the ice-crystals. [ILLUSTRATION IN TEXT] The diagram shows the arrangement of the arcs: S = Sun.

Tom did not know where they were taking him; it might be to court martial and death. He knew nothing about court martial, whether it was a matter of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or hours or days, only he knew that everything in military administration was quick, severe and thorough. He wanted to speak to his brother, but he did not dare, and after the grim little procession was gone he listened to the steady, ominous footfalls, as they receded along the deck. Soon they would come for _him_, and he made up his mind that he would be master of himself and at the last minute he would hold his head up and look straight at them, just like the statue of...", "...the west, taking the road over the bridge and following it to the connecting branch and thence to the lane. A half hour later he was standing in old Cragg's stone lot and another hour was consumed among the huge stones by the hillside--the place where Josie had discovered the entrance to the underground cave. Mr. Sinclair did not discover the entrance, however, so finally he returned to town and mounted the stairs beside Sol Jerrem's store building to the upper hallway. In five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he was inside of Cragg's outer office; in another five minutes he had entered the inner office. There he remained until the unmistakable herald of dawn warned him to be going. However, when he left the building there was no visible evidence of his visit. He was in his own room and in bed long before Mrs. Hopper gave a final snore and wakened to light the kitchen fire and prepare for the duties of the day.

The four of them, timid riders on the gigantic saddle, clung for their lives against her titan ribs, while currents of some majestic life swept up at them from every side.

Avoiding the pallid, insignificant faces of his companions, he pretended interest in the porter's operations; he stared fixedly on the ground. It seemed twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before the flame was extinguished, and the lantern fastened to the pack behind. This Dawn was unlike any he had seen before. For, in reality, all the while, Limasson was trying to bring order out of the extraordinary thoughts and feelings that had possessed him during the slow forest ascent, and the task was not crowned with much success. The Plan, made by others, had taken charge of him, he felt; and he had thrown the reins of personal will and interest loosely upon its...", "...the king's palace, where she intended to go, but she was so afraid her flight would be noticed that she whipped up her horses till they ran away.

The horses, thus left without any control, dashed blindly against a tree, and the queen was flung out on the ground, where she lay for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> unconscious. A rustling sound near her at length caused her to open her eyes; before her stood a huge woman, almost a giantess, without any clothes save a lion's skin, which was thrown over her shoulders, while a dried snake's skin was plaited into her hair. In one hand she held a club on which she leaned, and in the other a quiver full of arrows. At the sight of this strange figure the queen thought she must be dead, and gazing on an inhabitant of another world. So she...", "...of hands among the audience in lively and continuous motion. \"Hereupon, Concert-Master _Fischer_ surprised the Orchestra as well as the audience not a little, by falling in with the full Organ, in order to introduce the now ensuing chorus of the Finale, in C-Major.

And there it hung. After three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more of hard work on the auctioneer's part the pony went to Ripley at forty-one dollars. \"I don't know what my father will say to me for this,\" groaned the lawyer's son. \"But, anyway, Prescott and his crew didn't get the chestnut pony, and this is the last piece of live stock, so there's none left for them.\" He cast a triumphant look in the direction of those whom he termed \"the mucker boys.\" \"Rip was bidding to keep us from getting a look-in!\" whispered Tom Reade...", "...he came to the little valley between the two ridges, and under the stars, more brilliant now in the chill clearness of the early autumn nights, he followed the creek down into their old swamp home.

Broken Tooth and the other beavers had wrought a big change in what had once been his home and Gray Wolf's, and for many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Kazan stood silent and motionless at the edge of the pond, sniffing the air heavy with the unpleasant odor of the usurpers. Until now his spirit had remained unbroken. Footsore, with thinned sides and gaunt head, he circled slowly through the swamp. All that day he searched. And his crest lay flat now, and there was a hunted look in the droop of his shoulders and in the shifting look of his eyes. Gray Wolf was gone. Slowly nature was impinging that fact upon him. She had...", "...was a very narrow one. What kind of attention would such persons have paid to some middle-class woman with whom they were not acquainted, who possessed great experience of Army nursing and had decided views upon hospital reform? They would have politely ignored her; but it was impossible to ignore Flo Nightingale. When she spoke, they were obliged to listen; and, when they had once begun to do that--what might not follow? She knew her power, and she used it. She supported her weightiest <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with familiar witty little notes. The Bison began to look grave. It might be difficult--it might be damned difficult--to put down one's head against the white hand of a lady ... Of Miss Nightingale's friends, the most important was Sidney Herbert.

And then he began running with the lightness of a llama in the traces of the caravan. On reaching the spot where the road formed a bend, he thrust out his head, and then hurriedly withdrawing it, climbed up the side of a wood-clad height and disappeared. This man was Tcharanguii, the feared and formidable chief of the Jaos, one of the most powerful tribes of the twelve Molucho nations. For some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the rustling of parted branches might be heard, then all became silent again, the sole interruption being the imposing sounds of the desert. CHAPTER XIV. THE RUPTURE. They travelled the whole day without any incidents: the heat which had so incommoded them all during the first few days, had been succeeded by a temperature which hourly became colder. The foliage of the trees assumed a deeper tinge of green; the singing birds of the llanos, whose sweet notes...", "...said. Poor Janeira, she always forgot she was a nigger herself, seeing so many white faces all around her. But when she looked into the little mirror that hung in her pantry, she used to go into fits of laughter at her face therein displayed. She was a funny girl. Ransey used to take Nelda up on these nights, and hoist her on to the grating abaft the quarterdeck, and she would cling to his arm, while he held on to the bulwark. Thus they would stand, silent and awed, for long <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at a time. Was there nothing to break the dread stillness? There was occasionally the flap of a sail, or a footstep forward; but no song from the men, no loud talking--they hardly cared to speak above a whisper. But more than once a plash was heard, and a great dark head would appear from the side of a billow, seen distinctly enough in the gleam of the starlight, then sink and disappear. \"Oh, the awful beast, 'Ansey! Can it climb up and swallow us?\" \"No, dear silly,...", "...their heads to and fro, to excite compassion, and yet be graceful, and how to use their handkerchiefs to shew people the tears in them and the fineness of the lace.

I put on my mask, told Zenobia to go to bed, as we would not be back till daybreak, and set out on my way. I entered the ball-room, and as there were a score of Pierrots nobody noticed me. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after there was a rush to see some maskers who were coming in, and I stood so as to have a good view. The marquis came in first between the two cousins. Their slow, pitiful step matched the part wonderfully. Mdlle. Q---- with her flame-coloured dress, her splendid hair, and her fine shape, drew all eyes towards her.

Seconds dragged into minutes, long <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> into an eternity, and yet the beast did not spring.

The route was now over scrubby sandstone hills for three hours, and then descended into an open flat, with box, bloodwood, and Moreton-Bay ash, triodia, and grass growing on a sandy loam.

He hung his saddle and bridle, his English boots, and his saddle-bags on the highest bough that he could reach, and made them fairly fast with strips of flax leaf, for there was some stunted flax growing on the ground where he had camped.

Asparagus, Beets, Carrots, Parsnips, Peas, Sweet Potatoes, and Turnips require six minutes blanching, ninety minutes sterilizing. Asparagus requires one hundred and twenty minutes. Corn requires five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> blanching on the cob; three minutes sterilizing after being cut from the cob, or on the cob. Lima or String Beans or Peas require five minutes blanching; two hours sterilizing. Pumpkin and Squash require five minutes blanching; one and one-half hours sterilizing.

In a flash all her resentment had gone, wiped away and annihilated like a mist before the sun. She loved him, and she knew now that she had always loved him. It took her two seconds to realize that the 'One in Authority' was a miserable incompetent, incapable of recognizing merit when it was displayed before him. It took her five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to dress. It took her a minute to run downstairs and out to the news-stand on the corner of the street. Here, with a lavishness which charmed and exhilarated the proprietor, she bought all the other papers which he could supply. Moments of tragedy are best described briefly. Each of the papers noticed the play, and each of them damned it with uncompromising heartiness. The criticisms varied only in tone. One cursed with relish and gusto; another with a certain pity; a third...", "...House, sending the cyclists out along the valley to Dikehead. All was quiet in our immediate vicinity for some time, until suddenly we discerned the cyclists coming back. They reported that they had seen cavalry. This, then, must be a detachment of the enemy, who in all probability were retreating. I at once sent the cyclists back to inform Planck, and to tell him we should not take a hand in the game until we had allowed them to pass and they had discovered his barricade. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we could distinctly hear them approaching. We were all well under cover, but I was surprised to find that it was only an escort. \"They were galloping, and had evidently come a long distance by some circuitous route, and had not taken part in the fighting.

They appeared to expect no interruption, and it occurred...", "...how fast it would work. The next afternoon and evening there was little to provide an indication, other than an occasional look that came over Curt for moments at a time. A date was made for Saturday. It was to be a picnic in the country. That meant skipping Friday. Fred violently objected, but Curt and his mother overrode his objections. So in the end it had to be Saturday, unless Curt disappeared before then. He didn't. * * * * * But ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before school was out Friday a note was brought into the classroom from the principal's office. Curt had called to ask Fred to come to his office directly from school. Torn between excited anticipation that the psychiatrist had made an important discovery, and fear that the man would have vanished before he could get to him, Fred ran from the school building and caught the bus. At Curt's office the receptionist smiled and told him to go right in. His sigh of relief was...", "...smile of satisfaction crosses Stemaw's dark visage, for one of his traps is set in that place, and he knows that something is caught. Quickly descending the slope, he enters the bushes whence the sound proceeds, and pauses when within a yard or two of his trap, to peer through the gloom. A cloud passes off the moon, and a faint ray reveals, it may be, a beautiful black fox caught in the snare. A slight blow on the snout from Stemaw's axe-handle kills the unfortunate animal; in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more it is tied to his sledge, the trap is reset and again covered over with snow, so that it is almost impossible to tell that anything is there; and the Indian pursues his way. The steel-trap used by the Indians is almost similar to the ordinary rat-trap of England, with this difference, that it is a little larger, is destitute of teeth, and has two springs in place of one. A chain is attached to one spring for the purpose of fixing a weight to the trap, so that the...", "...and then suddenly this opportunity came. But you can't understand. Good-afternoon!\" For the second time that day the duke was mildly surprised, but he understood. \"My dear sir,\" he said in a very different tone, \"how was I to guess? I am very sorry, but I really am so--so ignorant of all these things. Come and sit down and interview me to your heart's content. What does it matter, after all? Will you have a whisky and soda, or, perhaps, some tea? I'll call my scout.\" In five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Burnside was making notes and asking questions with a swift and practical ability that compelled his host's interest and admiration. The duke had never met any one of his own age so business-like and alert. His own friends and contemporaries were so utterly different. He became quite confidential, and found that he was really enjoying the conversation. After the interview was over the two young men remained talking frankly to each other for a few minutes, and, wide as the...", "...green night-gown, and will buy a new trimming for the pink.'--'I shall be sure to obey your orders, Madam,' replied the other: 'but I must intreat you will do me the honour to come in and drink a dish of tea; the kettle boils, and I have just now had a present of a cannister of some of the finest Hyson in the world.'--'I must leave you then as soon as I have tasted it,' said Miss Betsy, coming out of the chair; 'for I have twenty visits to make this evening.' She had not been three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the parlour, when the person for whom all this ceremony was affected, entered the room in somewhat of an abrupt manner. 'I come, Mrs. Modely, to complain,' said he--'my servants tell me--' With these words he stopt short, and fixed his eyes full on Miss Betsy, with a kind of astonishment.--Mrs. Modely, pretending to be in a great fright, cried, 'For Heaven's sake, Sir Frederick! what is the matter? I hope nothing in my house has given your honour any cause of...", "...announced that he had been a blacksmith in Mexico. \"Well, he can't do no worse than the rest of us,\" Bronco decided, but one day's trial proved Loco was first-class in that work, and so he was transferred from range work to the blacksmith shop with increased pay and additional respect. He was pounding a red-hot iron on the anvil one day, when Traynor sauntering to the entrance of the shop, stood watching him. \"How soon will you be ready to start, Loco?\" he asked. \"In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I will finish, Senor.\" \"What is it?\" Traynor asked idly. Without looking up the Mexican replied; \"It is a branding iron, Senor.\" He skillfully bent the end of the iron, thrust it into a tub of water for a couple of seconds, then withdrew and examined it critically, after which he heated it again. It was a peculiarly shaped iron, and Traynor dropped on a box and looked with interest, as Loco pressed it on a board, leaving a mark covering a space four inches each...", "...or she could stand pat! If she said nothing, not a soul could befoul her by linking her name to that of a stage-robber, She _must_ stand pat! There was but one channel through which the news that Bob McGraw had been harbored at the Hat Ranch could possibly filter. People might _think_ what they pleased, but they could never _prove,_ provided Doc Taylor remained discreet. Therefore it behooved Mr. Hennage to see Doc Taylor immediately. That possible leak must be plugged at once. Three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the gambler strolled into the drugstore. \"How\" he saluted. \"Hello, Hennage.\" \"What's new?\" \"Nothing much.

And as near as I can make out, Hennage, it's the same fellow I attended that time down at the Hat Ranch.\" \"It is\" Mr. Hennage agreed quietly. \"At least, I believe it is.

It is, therefore, desirable that the attendant should run the engine at least once in every three days to keep it in working order. If it can be conveniently arranged, it is a good plan for the attendant to run the engine for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to entirely empty the pump well about six o'clock each evening. The bulk of the day's sewage will then have been delivered, and can be disposed of when it is fresh, while at the same time the whole storage capacity is available for the night flow, and any rainfall which may occur, thus reducing the chances of the man being called up during the night. About 22 per cent, of the total daily dry weather flow of sewage is delivered between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. The first cost of...", "...disappointed. He had set his heart on rushing headlong into his consultation with Midwinter, and here was the consultation indefinitely delayed. \"What an odd fellow he is!\" thought Allan. \"What on earth can he be doing, locked in there by himself?\" He was doing nothing. He was sitting by the window, with the letter which had reached him that morning open in his hand. The handwriting was Mr. Brock's, and the words written were these: \"MY DEAR MIDWINTER--I have literally only two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before post time to tell you that I have just met (in Kensington Gardens) with the woman whom we both only know, thus far, as the woman with the red Paisley shawl. I have traced her and her companion (a respectable-looking elderly lady) to their residence--after having distinctly heard Allan's name mentioned between them. Depend on my not losing sight of the woman until I am satisfied that she means no mischief at Thorpe Ambrose; and expect to hear from me again as soon as I...", "...exertions more confused and feeble. In this last calculation he may have been partially correct, for the threat was fearful, and the danger imminent; the harsh, deep tones of his voice, with the ferocious determination of his manner, sent a thrill of horror to every heart. More than this, he could not effect; there was not a craven spirit among our number. \"Steadily!\" said Arthur, in a low, collected tone; \"less than five minutes will bring us within hail of the ship.\" But the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> seemed hours, amid such tremendous exertions, and such intense anxiety. The sweat streamed from the faces of the rowers; they gasped and panted for breath; the swollen veins stood out on their foreheads. \"Perhaps,\" cried Luerson, after a pause, \"perhaps there is some one in that boat who desires to save his life; whoever drops his oar shall not be harmed; the rest die.\" A scornful laugh from Morton was the only answer to this tempting offer. Luerson now stooped for a...", "...old Ford and peered inside, Florence close behind. Both girls opened their eyes wide on seeing the quantities of pottery and baskets piled in the back of the car. Just as Jo Ann was about to whisper to Florence that she believed the car belonged to smugglers, she suddenly noticed that there was steam jetting out from the radiator. She pointed meaningly to the steam. Florence caught the point immediately. Since the engine was still hot the car must have been hidden there only a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before. Without saying a word she indicated to Jo Ann that they must hurry away. Jo Ann lingered for one long keen-eyed look at the battered old car and especially at the license tag. She was determined to be able to identify the car if she should see it again. She felt that there was something mysterious about its being hidden there. A moment later she followed Florence back down the slope. Silently they continued on down the gully. On noticing a path leading upward a few...", "...the ignominious flight of the head of our column, though, for some reason, the enemy's advance upon us was slow.

The ambulances with our groaning wounded men came pouring into the village, and to our surprise, those women, who had so recently given only evidence of a horrified hatred, pressed round to offer every aid that lay in their power, and to comfort our suffering men as only kind-hearted women can. With the increasing daylight the pursuit was...", "...for you to be found hanging about here after that.\" It appeared after a short parley that General Feraud was willing to accept these conditions. While the seconds were loading the pistols he could be heard whistling, and was seen to rub his hands with an air of perfect contentment. He flung off his coat briskly, and General D'Hubert took off his own and folded it carefully on a stone. \"Suppose you take your principal to the other side of the wood and let him enter exactly in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> from now,\" suggested General D'Hubert calmly, but feeling as if he were giving directions for his own execution. This, however, was his last moment of weakness. \"Wait! Let us compare watches first.\" He pulled out his own. The officer with the chipped nose went over to borrow the watch of General Feraud. They bent their heads over them for a time. \"That's it. At four minutes to five by yours. Seven to, by mine.\" It was the cuirassier who remained by the side of General...", "...issued to all the Saints to assemble on the 27th of March, 1836, to witness the dedication of the first temple that had been built to the name of the Lord in these days. On the appointed day a large congregation was gathered inside and outside the building. At nine o'clock, services were commenced by Sidney Rigdon reading the ninty-sixth and twenty-fourth Psalms. Singing and prayer were then offered, after which a discourse was delivered by Elder Rigdon. An intermission of twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> was made between the morning and afternoon services; the people, however did not leave their seats. In the afternoon, after the usual preliminary exercises, Joseph made a short address, and called upon the various quorums to sustain the presidency of the Church and all those who were called to preside. After singing, Joseph offered the dedicatory prayer, which will be found in the Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 109 of the new edition. At the close of this sublime prayer the...", "...pieces, place all in a stew-pan and cover with a couple quarts of hot water.

His friend now joined him, and the mare, finding that they were keeping close behind her, trotted on till the gate of the paddock was reached, where she waited for them. On its being opened, she led them across the field to a deep ditch on the farther side, when, what was their surprise to find that her colt had fallen into it, and was struggling on its back with its legs in the air, utterly unable to extricate itself. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more probably it would have been dead. The mare, it was evident, finding that the servant did not comprehend her wishes, had again and again sought her master, in whom she had learned from past experience to confide.

The men were moving towards her, still talking and laughing. She turned to the shelves, and affected to search for a book. The voices drew near, and one of them was well known to her; now she could hear every word; now the speakers were gone by. Was it possible that Mr Milvain had not recognised her? She followed him with her eyes, and saw him take a seat not far off he must have passed without even being aware of her. She went back to her place and for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> sat trifling with a pen. When she made a show of resuming work, it was evident that she could no longer apply herself as before. Every now and then she glanced at people who were passing; there were intervals when she wholly lost herself in reverie. She was tired, and had even a slight headache.

In this manner I have sometimes collected the gas produced from the deflagration of an ounce and half, or two ounces, of nitre. In this manner of operating it is impossible to determine the quantity of carbonic acid gas disengaged, because a part of it is absorbed by the water while passing through it; but, when the carbonic acid is absorbed, the azotic gas remains; and, if it be agitated for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in caustic alkaline solution, we obtain it pure, and can easily determine its volume and weight. We may even, in this way, acquire a tollerably exact knowledge of the quantity of carbonic acid by repeating the experiment a great many times, and varying the proportions of charcoal, till we find the exact quantity requisite to deflagrate the whole nitre employed. Hence, by means of the weight of charcoal employed, we determine the weight of oxygen necessary for saturation, and...", "...after a year's separation and to ask her in marriage, suddenly, without warning, was an unusual proceeding.

He cared not how soon they might be interrupted; he knew what he had to say, and he was prepared to say it briefly. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> would be time enough--five minutes, if he could but have them clear. When a man has been wanting for years to be able to put a simple question, it ought not to take him long to say the needful words; and he knew that Winifred would not keep him waiting for his answer.

What is your opinion?\" Old Tabaret remained some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> without answering; he was estimating the probabilities resulting from M. de Commarin's letters. \"For my own part,\" said he at length, \"I believe on my conscience that you are not Madame Gerdy's son.\" \"And you are right!\" answered the advocate forcibly. \"You will easily believe, will you not, that I went and saw Claudine. She loved me, this poor woman who had given me her milk, she suffered from the knowledge of the injustice that had been done me. Must I say it, her...", "...nothing towards fulfilling her promise of giving her necessary clothing, although Nelly's tattered frock was worn beyond all possibility of repairing. Nelly was conscious of the doubtful look with which she was regarded when she asked for Lucy, and she shrank from again encountering it, and perhaps bringing discredit on Miss Lucy in the eyes of her city friends by her own disreputable appearance. One afternoon in June--Mrs. Williams and her daughter being out--Nelly, having a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to spare, was standing at the open door, listening to the plaintive strains of an organ-grinder who was playing close by. His dark Italian face looked sad and careworn, and the little girl beside him, evidently his daughter from the resemblance between them, looked so pale and feeble, that it seemed as if her little thin hands could scarcely support the tambourine she was ringing in accompaniment to a little plaintive song. Nelly enjoyed the performance exceedingly, but her...", "...and perhaps if she were to make herself more abject, he would grasp the olive branch. As Bridget suggested, what did it matter so that they came together at last? Granting his love, as there could be no doubt about her own, it would be sheer foolishness to allow the present unfortunate estrangement to continue. So she took a pen presently, and after profound consideration succeeded in writing the few necessary words-- \"MY DEAR MARK, \"Will you be magnanimous and spare me a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after dinner this evening? \"Yours very sincerely, \"CARRISSIMA.\" The mountain in labour having brought forth a mouse, Carrissima put on her hat and set out, intending personally to post the letter. There would be ample time. He would receive it before seven o'clock, and, it was to be hoped, reach Grandison Square soon after nine. She determined to be on the watch for his arrival, in order to take him to some unoccupied room. Well, what then? she wondered, as she...", "...that she would be angry with anyone who was doing her duty properly. CHAPTER NINE--THE EMPEROR KWANG HSU THE next day I arose earlier than usual and dressed in a great hurry, as I feared I might be late. When I got to Her Majesty's Palace there were a few Court ladies there sitting on the veranda. They smiled and asked me to sit down with them as it was still too early, being only five o'clock. I had been told to wake Her Majesty at five thirty. The Young Empress came up a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later and we all courtesied and wished her \"good morning.\" After talking with us a few minutes, she asked if Her Majesty was awake and which one of us was on duty that day. When I informed her that it was my turn, she immediately ordered me to go to Her Majesty's room at once. I went very quietly and found some servant girls standing about and one Court lady, who was sitting on the floor. She had been on duty all night. When she saw me she got up and whispered to me, that now...", "...felt that it was of ill-omen that his duties as judge, of which he knew the sacred solemnity, should be thus--thus begun. It was in a softened mood, sunk in thought as to how he could best save Hiram and leave Paula's name altogether out of the matter, that he went to the hall of justice; and there he found the nurse Perpetua in eager discussion with Nilus. The old woman was quite beside herself. In the clatter of her loom she had heard nothing of what had been going on till a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago; now she was ready to swear to the luckless Hiram's innocence. The stone he had sold had belonged to his young mistress, and thank God there was no lack of evidence of the fact; the setting of the emerald was lying safe and sound in Paula's trunk. Happily she had had an opportunity of speaking to her; and that she, the daughter of Thomas, should be brought before the tribunal, like a citizen's daughter or slave-girl, was unheard of, shameful! At this Orion roughly...", "...quickly. \"It was nothing. The rope is good and strong, and all we had to do was to draw him out. It would have been dangerous for one man--he would have died--but we are three, and we help each other; so it is nothing.\" The two travellers exchanged glances, wondering at the man's coolness; but they were given no time to think, for Melchior quickly examined the knots of the rope which secured it about Saxe's chest, and strode on again, so that they were obliged to follow. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later they had reached the rocky side of the glacier valley, and a stiff ascent was before them. Here they found more than ever the value of their guide, for his climbing powers seemed almost marvellous, while almost by instinct he selected the easiest route. But the easiest was very hard, and every now and then he threw himself back against the rock in difficult places, planted his feet firmly wide apart, and steadily hauled upon the rope, making the ascent of the others...", "...Mrs. Boyce also seemed to enjoy herself. As to the Mrs. Boyces on such occasions, I profess that I feel no pity. They are generally happy in their children's happiness, or if not, they ought to be. At any rate, they are simply performing a manifest duty, which duty, in their time, was performed on their behalf. But on what account do the Mrs. Hearns betake themselves to such gatherings? Why did that ancient lady sit there hour after hour yawning, longing for her bed, looking every ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at her watch, while her old bones were stiff and sore, and her old ears pained with the noise? It could hardly have been simply for the sake of the supper. After the supper, however, her maid took her across to her cottage, and Mrs. Boyce also then stole away home, and the squire went off with some little parade, suggesting to the young men that they should make no noise in the house as they returned. But the poor curate remained, talking a dull word every now and then to Mrs....", "...have bored you with this talk, but I'm weak, and my nerve's gone.\" \"How much money have you got?\" I asked. He pulled a poor piece of silver from his pocket. \"Enough to do me till I join the pick-and-shovel gang.\" \"What are those tickets in your hand?\" He laughed carelessly. \"Chances in the ice pools. Funny thing, I don't remember buying them. Must have been drunk.\" \"Yes, and you seem to have had a 'hunch.' You've got the same time on all three: seven seconds, seven <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past one, on the ninth--that's to-day. It's noon now. That old ice will have to hurry up if you're going to win. Fancy, if you did! You'd clean up over three thousand dollars. There would be your new start.\" \"Yes, fancy,\" he echoed mockingly. \"Over five thousand betting, and the guesses as close as peas in a pod.\" \"Well, the ice may go out any moment. It's awful rotten.\" With a curious fascination, we gazed down at the mighty river. Around us was a glow of spring...", "...I don't want you to be tired to-night.\" After his wife went upstairs Alexander worked energetically at the greens for a few moments. Then, as he was cutting off a length of string, he sighed suddenly and sat down, staring out of the window at the snow. The animation died out of his face, but in his eyes there was a restless light, a look of apprehension and suspense. He kept clasping and unclasping his big hands as if he were trying to realize something. The clock ticked through the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of a half-hour and the afternoon outside began to thicken and darken turbidly. Alexander, since he first sat down, had not changed his position. He leaned forward, his hands between his knees, scarcely breathing, as if he were holding himself away from his surroundings, from the room, and from the very chair in which he sat, from everything except the wild eddies of snow above the river on which his eyes were fixed with feverish intentness, as if he were trying to project...", "...obliged to withdraw from the tutor's. Louis was obliged to relinquish that hand folded, clasped, hidden in his own. \"I thought I should have had to support her,\" he said, as he walked towards Briarmains, \"and it is she who has made me strong. That look of pity, that gentle touch! No down was ever softer, no elixir more potent! It lay like a snowflake; it thrilled like lightning. A thousand times I have longed to possess that hand--to have it in mine. I _have_ possessed it; for five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I held it. Her fingers and mine can never be strangers more. Having met once they must meet again.\" CHAPTER XXXII. THE SCHOOLBOY AND THE WOOD-NYMPH. Briarmains being nearer than the Hollow, Mr. Yorke had conveyed his young comrade there. He had seen him laid in the best bed of the house, as carefully as if he had been one of his own sons. The sight of his blood, welling from the treacherously inflicted wound, made him indeed the son of the Yorkshire gentleman's...", "...TRIES PHOTOGRAPHY 287 XXIV ALTON CELEBRATES 302 ILLUSTRATIONS \"Go out and play full-back as it should be played\" _Frontispiece_ \"You don't come that, Harmon!

Although decidedly dissimilar in looks and slightly dissimilar in build, they showed, nevertheless, a certain uniformity of carriage and action and, to a lesser degree, of attire. There was nothing strange in that, however, since, for the last two...", "...cool upon a sieve or wire cake-rack.

In another second she is high in the air, and already Halifax has nearly receded from the engineer's sight. The rate of a mile in three seconds is kept up till Sydney rapidly appears in view. In the next few seconds the engineer exerts his skill and the car lands gracefully on the slide, still in brisk motion. After a little scraping and crunching on the runners, she pulls up at the station platform at the bottom of the decline, ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> only after leaving Halifax. The next spring is made to St. John's, Newfoundland, which is reached in fourteen minutes. Here a few minutes are taken up in pointing the car accurately for Galway. Great caution is necessary, and very delicate and beautiful instruments are employed. When all are on board again and ready for the supermarine voyage, the engineer loads up with a much more powerful charge than before. He prepares at the start for a speed of a mile in three seconds,...", "...at finding it entirely deserted, save for some twenty men, lying dead or dying in front of the gate of the convent, pierced with long arrows. They speedily found that Sir Rudolph and his troop had departed; and further inquiry revealed the fact that the burgher guard at one of the gates had been overpowered and were prisoners in the watchroom. These could only say that they were suddenly seized, all being asleep save the one absolutely on guard. They knew nothing more than that a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later there was a great clatter of horsemen and men on foot leaving the city. Unable to find any solution to this singular circumstance, but satisfied that Sir Rudolph had departed, and that no more disturbance was likely to arise that night, the burgesses again betook themselves to their beds, having closed the gates and placed a strong guard over them, determining next morning to sift the affair to the bottom. In the morning the leading burgesses met in council, and finding...", "...things so much. I scarcely thought of going to town, but here I am; and now for more details, and much more promising ones. Captain Fitz-Roy is [in] town, and I have seen him; it is no use attempting to praise him as much as I feel inclined to do, for you would not believe me. One thing I am certain, nothing could be more open and kind than he was to me. It seems he had promised to take a friend with him, who is in office and cannot go, and he only received the letter five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before I came in; and this makes things much better for me, as want of room was one of Fitz-Roy's greatest objections. He offers me to go share in everything in his cabin if I like to come, and every sort of accommodation that I can have, but they will not be numerous. He says nothing would be so miserable for him as having me with him if I was uncomfortable, as in a small vessel we must be thrown together, and thought it his duty to state everything in the worst point of view....", "...where, as Under Secretary of State, he then made his official home. Mark Twain's tears over the grave of Adam, a relative buried in a strange land, all will recall. On a basis as good perhaps, I walked through Downing Street with a certain sense of proprietorship, for did it not bear the name and had it not been the home of my brother in the pleasant Harvard bond, Sir George Downing, of the class of 1642? In the ante-room with its upholstery of dark-green leather I mused for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> alone, over diplomatic conferences of which it had probably been the scene, but Mr. Bryce quickly entered, slight and sinewy, in his best years, kindly, courteous to the man sent by a friend whom he held among the closest. Bryce at that time was on the threshold of his fame. He had written _The Holy Roman Empire_ which I knew well. He had been Regius Professor at Oxford, whose shades he had not long before forsaken for politics. That he had a special interest in and knowledge...", "...this she came upstairs again. When she came to the drawing-room door, Charles was standing at it. \"Lady Hainault,\" he said, \"would you come here, please? Poor Mary has fainted.\" \"Poor thing,\" said Lady Hainault. \"I will come to her. One word, Mr. Ravenshoe. Oh, do think one instant of this fatal, miserable resolution of yours.

At all events, stay ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more, and see one of them. I must go to poor Mary.\" \"Dear Lady Hainault, you will not change my resolution to stand alone. There is a source of disgrace you probably know nothing of. Besides, nothing short of an Order in Council could stop me now. We sail for the East in twenty-four hours.\" They had just time for this, very hurriedly spoken, for poor little Mary had done what she never had done before in her life, fainted away. Lady Hainault and Charles went into the...", "...with a purpose. Only by that means--only by making the doctor think that I was practically unconscious of what he was doing, was I able to observe him clearly. They tried to poison you last night.\" I suppose she saw the truth in my face; she came suddenly to me, and laid her hands on my arm, and looked at me with startled eyes. \"To poison me?\" she echoed breathlessly. \"Yes, the doctor and Martha Leach. That was why I upset the table and flung the wine away. If you had seen me five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after you left the room, you would have known what my real condition was. The doctor knew it, I can assure you!\" I laughed at the recollection. Debora looked quickly all round about her, with the frightened air of one who would escape, but sees no way; there was a hunted look in her eyes that appalled me. \"What shall I do?\" she whispered. \"I am more frightened than I care to say, because I know Dr. Just, and I know how relentless he can be. Don't you understand, John,\" she...", "...said Count Victor. \"My father would have been somewhat more summary in circumstances like these,\", said the Duke, \"and, by Heaven! the old style had its merits too; but these are different days, though, if I were you, I fancy I'd prefer the short shrift of Long David the dempster to the felon's cell. Be good enough to leave your sword.\" Count Victor said never a word, but placed the weapon in a corner of the room, made a deep _conge_, and went forth a prisoner. In the last few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of the interview he had forgotten the cold, but now when he was led into the open air he felt it in his coatless condition more poignant than his apprehension at his position otherwise. He shivered as he walked along the fosse, through which blew a shrewd north wind, driving the first flakes of an approaching snowstorm. The fosse was wide and deep, girding the four-square castle, mantled on its outer walls by dense ivy, where a few birds twittered. The wall was broken at...", "...girl was induced to come and occupy the middle place on the river side of the bench, between Vida and the tramp. While the lady held the penny in her hand, and cross-examined the still weeping child, Borrodaile sat quietly listening behind his paper.

The only person 'out of it' was the petrified gentleman on the other side.

'That'll be the little 'un,' said the tramp to nobody. 'You don't ketch 'er bein' late!' 'Blunt! No--cheeky little devil,' remarked one of the young men, offering a new light upon the royal virtue of punctuality; but from the enthusiasm with which they availed themselves of the rest of Lord...", "...blacked eyes and a broken nose, he came to the very just conclusion that it were well to save the blood of the Donahues. And to this end did he grant Mrs. Donahue board and lodging for one month in the old prison. Mrs. Donahue is led away, heaping curses on the head of Donahue, and compliments on that of his Honor. A pale, sickly looking boy, some eleven years old, is next placed upon the stand.

I had nourished Tank on thought-food for a good long session, and I knew he'd feel mighty much like a lost calf if I left him to rustle up his own idees; so I just gave my hands a little toss and kept on with my whistlin'. \"Aw, don't be so blame touchy,\" sez Spider Kelley. I had pulled Spider through a number o' tight places, also, and I knew he'd soon begin to feel trapped up and smothery, if I left him to sweat out his own idees for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> longer; so I gave him the same gesture I had bestowed on Tank. \"What do you think we'd better do, Olaf?\" sez Horace. Olaf looked all around but did not see anything. \"They have come up the ravine, took the path up the other side, through the clump o' trees, made a wide circle and got to our camp,\" sez Olaf. \"If we try to get away, they cut us off.

Madeleine; and he took his departure. The Fleming remained \"utterly stupid,\" as he himself said some time afterwards. The mayor had been gone two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> when the door opened again; it was the mayor once more. He still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air. \"Monsieur Scaufflaire,\" said he, \"at what sum do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me,--the one bearing the other?\" \"The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire,\" said the Fleming, with a broad smile. \"So be it.

We were compelled to stay within doors for some twenty minutes or so. This I decided to be the opportune occasion to unload my stock. I enjoined every vendor, when I handed him his stock overnight, to be on the alert in the morning, and as the clock struck nine to pass swiftly from man to man with his flags. The favour was a distinct novelty and I was positive they would sell like hot cakes. The scheme proved a howling success. Within five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the appointed hour every man had been cleared out. The flags were triumphantly pinned to the lapels of the coats. When the prisoners re-emerged from the barracks the guards were astounded by the brilliant display of Union Jacks. The array was so imposing that the authorities even realised the futility of stopping each prisoner in turn to rob him of his prize. In this manner I got rid of several hundreds of the little trophies in one swoop. As may be imagined there was...", "...before the old dread was awakened in Graeme. For only in one way was Marian different from her old self. She did not come to exert herself. She was, perhaps, a little quieter, too, but she was quite cheerful, taking as much interest as ever in home affairs and in the affairs of the village. Almost every day, after the sleighing became good, she enjoyed a drive with Graeme or her father, or with Mr Snow in his big sleigh after the \"bonny greys.\" They paid visits, too, stopping a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> at Judge Merle's or Mr Greenleaf's, or at some other friendly home in the village; and if their friends' eyes grew grave and very tender at the sight of them, it did not for a long time come into Graeme's mind that it was because they saw something that was invisible as yet to hers. So the time wore on, and not one in the minister's happy household knew that each day that passed so peacefully over them was leaving one less between them and a great sorrow. The first fear was...", "...was happy again, for she still had forty minutes of liberty, ample time in which mentally to run through a possible conversation with an inquisitive elderly gentleman and arrange all her material in paragraphs with a suitable introduction and conclusion.

My hands are too numb.\" For several endless minutes he clung there, listening. But this was a desolate part of the lake, far from any road; and the season was too early for other hunters to be abroad. The bitter cold, in any case, tended to make sane folk hug the fireside rather than to venture so far into the open. Nor was the single report of a gun uncommon enough to call for investigation in such weather. All this the Boy told himself, as the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> dragged by. Then he looked again at Wolf. The dog, head on one side, still stood protectingly above him. The dog was cold and in pain. But, being only a dog, it did not occur to him to trot off home to the comfort of the library fire and leave his master to fend for himself. Presently, with a little sigh, Wolf lay down on the ice, his nose across the Boy's arm. Even if he lacked strength to save his beloved master, he could stay and share the Boy's sufferings. But the Boy...", "...fields, where the quails were calling from the edge of the forest of Bonne Fontaine. \"Is Catherine asleep? and Aunt Gredel and Father Goulden and all the town?

In an instant after, the horseman came from Roly into our road at full gallop. I advanced to the edge of the hedge and presented my musket, and cried, \"Who goes there?\" \"France!\" \"What regiment?\" \"Twelfth chasseurs! Staff.\" \"Pass on!\" He went on his way faster than before. I heard him stop in the midst of our encampment, and call \"Commandant.\" I advanced to the top of the hill to see what was...", "...and his queer robe-like garment, his bald dome and his singular dark eyes only accentuated this. And the furtive-mannered Jason Collyer came in for his fair share of the boy's attention. There was a peculiar something in the sharp face and the light eyes that caused Ezra to class him as dangerous. \"Even, perhaps, more dangerous than Abdallah himself,\" thought the boy. \"He is of the kind that never trusts any one and would halt at nothing to gain its ends.\" It did not take many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> for these strangely-contrasted coworkers to master the contents of the documents.

The two special units it had been developing to deal with Ed were not quite done yet, but they were done enough to work for the few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the Harn needed them. Ed heard a coughing grunt behind him and spun around to see something new crawling out of the flame and smoke at the den entrance. This one was a roughly carrier shaped creature, but half again as large, built for killing. It had powerful fanged jaws and its eight feet were armed with knifelike, disemboweling claws.

He perceived that the phaen had aer head in a cavity and was scrutinising something, and waited for aer to reappear. Ae emerged, looked up to Maskull, and called out in aer hornlike voice, \"The entrance is here!\" \"I'm coming down!\" roared Maskull. \"Wait for me!\" He descended swiftly--without taking too much care, for he thought he recognised his \"luck\" in this discovery--and within twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> was standing beside the phaen. \"What happened?\" \"The rock you dislodged struck this other rock just above the spring. It tore it out of its bed. See--now there's room for us to get in!\" \"Don't get excited!\" said Maskull. \"It's a remarkable accident, but we have plenty of time. Let me look.\" He peered into the hole, which was large enough to admit a big man without stooping. Contrasted with the daylight outside it was dark, yet a peculiar glow pervaded the place, and...", "...of the gig; and young Courtenay, my especial chum, was fortunate enough to be chosen by Mr Douglas to command the second cutter. By Courtenay's advice, I procured from the armourer a ship's cutlass, to replace my almost useless dirk; and having carefully loaded and primed a very excellent pair of pistols with which my father had presented me, I thrust those useful articles into my belt and hastened on deck, just as the frigate was rounding to preparatory to anchoring. A couple of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the anchor was let go abreast of and scarcely half a mile distant from a small battery, the guns of which commanded the vessels we were about to attack, and the canvas was very smartly clewed up and furled. The men were still aloft when the battery, which had hoisted Spanish colours, opened fire upon us, the first shot severing our larboard main- topgallant back-stay. This damage, slight as it was, sufficed to effectually rouse Captain Pigot's hasty, irritable temper;...", "...She was angry, defiant and humiliated at once. What would the Evershams say--and Robert Falconer---- * * * * * She had never waited for anything as she waited for the answers to the passionately urgent notes she sent out. She had written the doctor, the ambassador, the consul, the Evershams. And then she walked up and down, up and down that long, dim room which grew darker and darker with the fading light and counted off the seconds and the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and the hours with her pulsing heart beats. She had never known there was such suspense in the world. It was comparable to nothing in her girl's life--the only faint analogy was in the old school-time when she thought she had failed in the history examination and her roommate had gone to the office to find out for her. She remembered walking the floor then, in a silly panic of fear. But she had not failed--she had just squeaked through and it would be like that now. Someone...", "...the flag any more. Ah! there is not one to compare with General Castro!\" The character of the Californian sala had changed for ever; the blue and gold of the United States had invaded it. The officers, young and old, looked with much interest at the faces, soft, piquant, tropical, which made the effect of pansies looking inquisitively over a snowdrift. The girls returned their glances with approval, for they were as fine and manly a set of men as ever had faced death or woman. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later California and the United States were flirting outrageously. Mr. Larkin presented a tall officer to Benicia. That the young man was very well-looking even Benicia admitted. True, his hair was golden, but it was cut short, and bore no resemblance to the coat of a bear; his mustache and brows were brown; his gray eyes were as laughing as her own. \"I suppose you do not speak any English, senorita,\" he said helplessly. \"No? I spik Eenglish like the Spanish. The Spanish...", "...line, he discovered us and wheeled to the right, and was dashing away at right angles with our line, when six of us brought our pieces to bear on him and fired. He fell from his horse, with one foot fastened in the stirrup. At that instant, the horse gave a leap over a log, and the dangling body struck the log and bounded into the air higher than the horse's back, and then struck the ground with a \"thug\" sufficient, to all appearances, to have crushed every bone in his body. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, I saw a rebel Major leading his regiment forward to charge upon one of our batteries. When I saw him he was not more than fifty yards distant. In an instant I brought my \"repeater\" to my face, and while I was looking at the prominent point of his right-cheek bone, a ball took him in the exact spot that I was looking at, and he tumbled from his horse. I now discovered that, instead of a regiment, a whole brigade was coming, and that our skirmishers had fallen back, and...", "...over the heads of the French soldiers, and a young soldier instinctively dodged. Napoleon looked at him and smilingly said: \"My friend, if that ball were destined for you, though you were to burrow a hundred feet under ground it would be sure to find you there.\" When the mine in front of Petersburg was finished, the fuse was lighted, and the Union troops were drawn up ready to charge the enemy's works as soon as the explosion should make a breach. But seconds, minutes, and tens of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed, without a sound from the mine, and the suspense became painful. Lieutenant Doughty and Sergeant Kees volunteered to examine the fuse. Through the long subterranean galleries they hurried in silence, not knowing but they were advancing to a horrible death. They found the defect, fired the train anew, and soon a terrible upheaval of earth gave the signal to march to victory.

She had evidently been told what had occurred, for she asked no questions, only leaned in still horror against the door-post, with her eyes fixed on the room within. Sinclair, advancing, held out his arm. She gave no sign of seeing it. Then he spoke. This seemed to rouse her, for she gave him a grateful look, though she did not take his arm. \"There will be no wedding to-morrow,\" fell from her lips in self-communing murmur. Only a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> had passed since they had started to find Dorothy, but it seemed an age to me. My body remained in the room, but my mind was searching the house for the girl I loved. Where was she hidden? Would she be found huddled but alive in some far-off chamber? Or was another and more dreadful tragedy awaiting us? I wondered that I could not join the search. I wondered that even Gilbertine's presence could keep Sinclair from doing so. Didn't he know what, in all probability, this missing...", "...alongside, and while MacGregor adjured us to show no fear, he beckoned the chief to come aboard. An instant, and a score of savages, armed with spears and nulla-nullas were on deck. MacGregor made signs that we were hungry, Blithelygo that we were thirsty, and the American, smoking all the while, offered the chief a cigar. The cigar was refused, but the headman ordered a couple of natives ashore, and in five minutes we had wild bananas and fish to eat, and water to drink. But that five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of waiting were filled with awkward incidents. Blithelygo, meaning to be hospitable, had brought up a tumbler of claret for the headman. With violent language, MacGregor stopped its presentation; upon which the poison of suspicion evidently entered the mind of the savage, and he grasped his spear threateningly. Van Blaricom, who wore a long gold watch-chain, now took it off and offered it to the chief, motioning him to put it round his neck. The hand was loosened on the spear,...", "...And so, flaunting her prowess in the rapidly-growing daylight, Z64 approached the town of Auckland. The Zeppelin was within ten miles of the place when one of the crew shouted the disconcerting information that there was an airship on the starboard bow, travelling east by north. Rapping out a furious oath, von Sinzig snatched up a pair of binoculars. He had never before set eyes on the \"Golden Hind,\" although the British airship had passed almost immediately above him within a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of Z64 leaving her Spanish base, but instinctively he realised that this was his greatest rival, Sir Reginald Fosterdyke's creation. \"Gott in Himmel!\" shouted von Sinzig. \"Leutter, you numbskull, you made a hideous mess of things last night! Look--the 'Golden Hind'!\" CHAPTER XVII--A SURPRISE FOR CAPTAIN PROUT Captain Abraham Prout, master and part owner of the topsail schooner _Myrtle_, of 120 tons burthen, came on deck on hearing the mate give the order \"All...", "...stoning a dying lady when they were so near death themselves.\" You could see the superstitious crowd shrink and catch their breath, under the sudden shock. The blacksmith, with a show of bravado, said: \"Pooh! What do you know about it?\" \"I? Everything. By profession I am a fortune-teller, and I read the hands of you three--and some others--when you lifted them to stone the woman. One of you will die to-morrow week; another of you will die to-night; the third has but five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to live--and yonder is the clock!\" It made a sensation. The faces of the crowd blanched, and turned mechanically toward the clock. The butcher and the weaver seemed smitten with an illness, but the blacksmith braced up and said, with spirit: \"It is not long to wait for prediction number one. If it fails, young master, you will not live a whole minute after, I promise you that.\" No one said anything; all watched the clock in a deep stillness which was impressive. When...", "...went on; \"and it's up to me to find you one. But I think you'll have to have a bath first, and your paw bandaged.\" Jumping up, Patricia darted back to the house, and around to the side door, leading to her father's office. Presently, she reappeared with a cake of antiseptic soap, a box of salve, a roll of bandage, a pair of scissors, and a bath-towel; with these gathered up in the skirt of her frock she led the way down to the brook, followed by a most unsuspecting small dog. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later that same small dog--decidedly sadder and wetter, if not wiser--lay shivering on the sunny bank, while Patricia rubbed him vigorously with one of her aunt's largest bath-towels. Then the cut paw was salved and bandaged, and the most hopelessly tangled knots of curls cut away. After which, Patricia, sitting back on heels, studied her charge approvingly. \"If Aunt Julia could see you _now_! Why didn't I do all this first? But--well, Aunt Julia's made up her mind; and she...", "...justify itself. However, we must do what we can. I am sure that you will agree with me that it would be folly to consume our air too rapidly by lighting an oil-stove. I have some small provision of cold meats, bread, and pickles which, with a couple of bottles of claret, may serve our turn. Thank you, my dear--now as ever you are the queen of managers.\" It was indeed wonderful how, with the self-respect and sense of propriety of the British housekeeper, the lady had within a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> adorned the central table with a snow-white cloth, laid the napkins upon it, and set forth the simple meal with all the elegance of civilization, including an electric torch lamp in the centre. Wonderful also was it to find that our appetites were ravenous. \"It is the measure of our emotion,\" said Challenger with that air of condescension with which he brought his scientific mind to the explanation of humble facts. \"We have gone through a great crisis. That means...", "...wondered. One night the black-haired woman again came home far gone in drink, and again Sam led her up the stairs to see her fall muttering and babbling upon the bed. Her companion, a little flashily dressed man with a beard, had run off at the sight of Sam standing in the living-room under the lamp. The two boys, to whom he had been reading, said nothing, looking self-consciously at the book upon the table and occasionally out of the corner of their eyes at their new friend. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they too went up the stairs, and as on that first night, they put out their hands awkwardly. Through the night Sam again sat in the darkness outside or lay awake on the couch. \"I will make a new try, adopt a new purpose in life now,\" he said to himself. When the children had gone to school the next morning, Sam took a car and went into the city, going first to a bank to have a large draft cashed. Then he spent many busy hours going from store to store and buying clothes,...", "...across. Jumping off, I pulled the horse into a ruined building, and there in the twilight I had a splendid opportunity to view the efficiency of the German observation work. They were making the most determined effort to prevent any communication being sent to the wagon lines for ammunition, and one continual stream of shells was following me down the road; they were dropping as thickly as hailstones for the entire distance up and down the road as far as I could see. I waited there ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and then led the horse out, walking a hundred yards towards the bridge. Then came another burst of shells; again I stopped for a few minutes, made another hundred yards, and another bursting storm of shells. I was walking the horse all this time, but I made up my mind the time had come to make a dash for it. I jumped on his back, lay flat as a pancake, and with a good stout stick I lammed that poor brute as few horses ever were lammed, made a dash for the bridge and got safely...", "...mobile, brown rather than red, and generally parted like those of a wild animal.

Then Sora Nanna put out her right hand as a signal to Annetta that she meant to stop, and she stood still on the steep descent and turned deliberately till she could see the girl. \"What are you saying?\" she began, as though there had been no pause in the conversation. \"That Sister Maria Addolorata sins in her throat! But how can she sin in her throat, since...", "...it is not, and here is that five hundred dollar bill you so foolishly surrendered to my friend the picture expert. Now, as all your fellow officers seem to have departed you can begin your duties by going upstairs and telling the ladies that the blockade has been raised.\" By the time Michael Phelan got the crisp saffron bill tucked away in his jeans he was in full and glorious grin and made for the stairway with an agility that was a distinct revelation of hidden resources.

As her now calmer eye took in the room and the empty picture frames, Mrs. Burton exclaimed: \"Whatever have you been doing here?\" \"Some of my canvases need cleaning,\" was the ready response, with a wink at Whitney Barnes, who was hovering about Sadie, \"so I took the most valuable ones out of the frames to send them to the cleaners.\" Mrs. Burton swallowed the fib and began a tour of inspection of the...", "...on the move, and turning the corner of the cliff began the descent towards the lake. As they did so both glanced at the direction of the sled they were pursuing. It was moving straight ahead, fairly close in shore, having evidently sought the level surface of the lake for easier travelling. More than that they had not leisure to notice, for the descent to the lake was steep, and it required the weight and skill of both to keep the sled from overrunning the dogs, but in the space of four <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> it was accomplished, and with a final rush they took the level trail of the lake's frozen and snow-covered surface. As they did so a gust of wind brought a scurry of snow in their faces, and Benard looked anxiously up into the sky. \"By-an'-by it snow like anythin', m'sieu.

It was now about nine o'clock in the morning, and we could not expect our game to come out before half past three at earliest.

We spent several week-ends in the country as a family, and no incident occurred to disturb either Helen or me. In fact, the prosperity and good nature were so general that once or twice Helen and I slipped away to look at little houses in the suburban country. We found the very thing we wanted at a small village in Hertfordshire, not far from St. Albans. It was a modern house, but it had a red-tiled roof and a pleasant garden of its own. \"Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> from the station,\" the agent said. He was a brisk walker. Helen went into raptures over the interior. She counted up seven bedrooms, four on the second, three above. \"Just the right number,\" she announced. It was a surprise to me that seven bedrooms were our lucky quota. I was rather vague about bedrooms, never having thought out how many we should need. Downstairs there was a sitting-room, a dining-room, another room, the kitchen, and what the agent, once more, referred to as...", "...out-of-the-way shop?\" \"Oh, I guess he goes nosing around after old books, sort of ferrets them out, like as not. Well, so long!

It took me about twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to reach the landing-place before the town, whence the boat had been observed approaching, and the very people I was in search of were ready to receive me. The principal magistrate was a very dignified old gentleman, with silver buckles on his shoes, velvet small-clothes, a three-cornered hat on his head, and a silver-mounted sword by his side. I did not expect to encounter such a personage in so out-of-the-way and rough-and-ready sort of a place. \"May I ask, sir, to what...", "...by your ready response.

When it was finished, Miss Bent...", "...It seemed just the same as usual, the cuckoo's doors closely shut, no sign of any disturbance. Could it have been her fancy only that he had sprung back more hastily than he would have done but for her throwing the book at him? She began to hope so, and tried to go on with her lessons. But it was no use. Though she really gave her best attention to the long addition sums, and found that by so doing she managed them much better than before, she could not feel happy or at ease. Every few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she glanced up at the clock, as if expecting the cuckoo to come out, though she knew quite well there was no chance of his doing so till twelve o'clock, as it was only the hours, not the half hours and quarters, that he told. \"I wish it was twelve o'clock,\" she said to herself anxiously more than once.

Hereabouts we saw nothing save 'hungry quartz.' Then we struck across three several ridges, whose slopes were notably easier on the eastern, and more abrupt on the western side. The people had sunk several pits in places likely to yield 'kindly quartz,' and they had made no mistakes as to the overlay of the lode, its foot-wall or its hanging-wall. Cameron presently made an offset to the north, and, cutting his road, walked ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> up the tail of Tuako Hill, at whose southern base lies the Nanwa bed. Here, guided by Mr. Grant, who knew the place well, he found a native shaft thirty feet deep and a lode of disintegrated quartz in red or yellow ferruginous clay, the surface looking as rich as the stone it overlies.

They will close them--but this part is cut off.

And he grinned happily through the glass of his helmet as he saw the others safely encased, while their suits slowly bulged as the pressure of the air about them went down and their own tanks of oxygen took up the task of maintaining one atmosphere of pressure.

At length they came so near that they heard shrieks and howls, and other sounds of battle. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the terrible scene was visible. Some of the palace guard were killed and mangled, others were yet defending themselves. Gigantic dogs, monsters of every sort, and hordes of savage warriors formed the enemy's ranks.

Someone began a song, others followed suit, and before long the austere sanctity of the room was violated...", "...discovery, for, just as she was crossing what may he termed the guarded line, one of the sentinels took it into his head to move in her direction. Of course she stopped and lay perfectly flat and still, but so near did the warrior come in passing that his foot absolutely grazed her head. But for the intense darkness of the night she would have inevitably been caught. Creeping swiftly out of the sentinel's way before he returned, she gained the centre of the camp, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> was close to her father's wigwam. Finding a little hole in the buffalo-skins of which it was chiefly composed, she peeped in. To her great disappointment, Little Tim was not there, but Brighteyes was, and a youth whom she knew well as one who was about to join the ranks of the men, and go out on his first war-path on the first occasion that offered. Although trained to observe the gravity and reticence of the Indian, this youth was gifted by nature with powers of...", "...out into the orange garden, looking at his watch as he left the door of the hotel. It was very hot, but further away from the house the sea breeze was blowing through the trees. He was still smoking the cigarette he had lighted upstairs, and he sat down on a bench in the shade, took out a pocket book and began to make notes. From time to time he looked along the path in the direction of the hotel, which was hidden from view by the shrubbery. Then the clock struck twelve and a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the church bells began to ring, as they do half a dozen times a day in Italy on small provocation. Still San Miniato went on with his calculations. Before many minutes more had passed, a trim young figure appeared in the path--a young girl, with pink cheeks and bright dark eyes, no other than Teresina, the Marchesa's maid. She carried some sewing in her hand and looked nervously behind her and to the right and left as she walked. But there was no one in the garden at...", "...browned quickly in hot fat and served at once.

They must not, however, remain here after daybreak, and therefore sought and found a place of concealment, again in the hateful swamp, but not far from the river's bank. They were soon enjoying the rest and sleep of the weary. Lemon was startled from his slumber by a sound resembling that of oars. He awoke Glazier, and both listened intently, at a loss to understand the meaning of such a sound in such a place. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the noise ceased, and looking cautiously from their hiding-place, they observed two men pass near them, having the appearance of messengers or couriers, with despatches, which they could plainly see in their hands. It at once occurred to our hero and his companion that the boat in which these men had rowed themselves up the river, could be made available for crossing to its opposite bank. They found it moored to a tree, and at once embarked and crossed the stream. To prevent...", "..._Times_ for October 29, 1914, \"in the fine old city of Wilna, a city of courtly Poles, the home of many of the old noble families of Poland. It is now thronged with Russian officers and soldiers. Along the main street is an incessant procession of troops, and as you look down you see vistas of bayonet-spikes waving like reeds in a wind. As you lie in bed at night you listen to the tramp, tramp, tramp of soldiers. Or you look out of the window and see wagons and guns passing for twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> on end, or you see prancing over the cobbles and the mud the Cossacks of the Don, of the Volga, of Seven Rivers. In the days of the revolutionary outburst the Poles bit their lips in hate at the sight of the Russian soldiers, they cursed under their breath, darted out with revolvers, shot, and aimed bombs. To-day they smile, tears run down their cheeks; they even cheer. Whoever would have thought to see the day when the Poles would cheer the Russian troops marching through the...", "...the regular's rifle rang out Fetter fell headlong across the camp-fire. \"Do you surrender?\" asked old Benson. \"Yes,\" came from Potts, sulkily, and his companion said the same. In the meantime Fetter had rolled from the camp-fire and was breathing his last at Potts' feet. The sight was a thrilling one, and caused Joe and Darry to shudder. \"Can't I do something for that poor wretch?\" asked Joe, of Benson, but before the old scout could answer Fetter breathed his last. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more Potts was made a close prisoner. While he was being tied up, the third man made a quick leap into the woods. \"After him!\" cried Benson, and Cass and Bernstein did as commanded. Soon the desperado and the two regulars were out of sight and hearing. CHAPTER XXXI. BURNING OF THE STOCKADE. \"What will you do with him?\" asked Joe of Benson, as he pointed to Nat Potts. \"Don't be hard on me,\" pleaded Potts. \"I meant you no harm.\" \"You ought to be hung,\"...", "...will be soundly beaten.

What do you mean? What is all the noise outside?\" \"The town has gone mad with fright--that is all. Monsieur must be quick in dressing.\" In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I was dressed and out of the house. Pillot was right--the town certainly had gone mad. The street was packed with people surging this way and that, pushing, struggling, and asking questions. There were hundreds of rumours in the air: Conde had crept into Gien, and had hanged Mazarin in his own room. The Queen-Mother was a prisoner with her two sons, and all her Guards had died fighting. I had hardly witnessed such a tumult even in Paris. Couriers and lackeys, coachmen and...", "...away up the glen, over the stones, down the hollows, shoutin' like mad, an' clearin' the brooks and precipices with a band o' yellin' Redskins at my tail!

The same servant appeared. 'Isn't the bath ready?' Hubert asked. His former mode of speaking had been brief and decided; he was now almost imperious. 'I believe it will be in a moment, sir,' was the reply, marked, perhaps, by just a little failure in the complete subservience expected. Hubert looked at the man for an instant with contracted brows, but merely said--'Tell them to be quick.' The man returned in less than three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with a satisfactory announcement, and Eldon went upstairs to refresh himself. Two hours later he had dined, with obvious lack of appetite, and was deriving but slight satisfaction from a cigar, when the servant entered with a message from Mrs. Eldon: she desired to see her son. Hubert threw his cigar aside, and made a gesture expressing his wish to be led to his mother's room. The man conducted him to the landing at the head of the first flight of stairs; there a female...", "...then made good. Accordingly, on October 2 a trial was held, at which the speed was checked with the aid of the second metre that had been forwarded, and several watches with seconds-hands. These showed the 13-1/3 miles run in 31 minutes. Of nineteen races run over this course, the average time was 33 minutes 40 seconds. In 1861 a race was run over another circular course, measuring about 3-1/2 miles, five times round. The mare that won performed the distance--about 17 miles--in 48 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> 45 seconds. In the Kalmak _uluses_ (groups of nomad tents) of the Astrachan Government, races of 10 miles have been held. The greatest speed recorded was in 1864, viz., 23 minutes 56 seconds; the longest time was in the same year, viz., 27 minutes. The average time between 1862 and 1865, and 1867 and 1869, was 25 minutes 15 seconds. The riders in these races are lads of not more than ten or twelve years of age. They are in no way specially trained, as from early age they are...", "...not to fight chunks of canned meat.

Nor will he act on the theory that he is \"so tired he can sleep anywhere.\" For a few hours the man who does that may sleep the sleep of exhaustion. But before day breaks he will feel under him the roots and stones, and when he awakes he is stiff, sore and unrefreshed. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> spent in digging holes for hips and shoulder-blades, in collecting grass and branches to spread beneath his blanket, and leaves to stuff in his boots for a pillow, will give him a whole night of comfort and start him well and fit on the next day's tramp.

And thus it has been, according to my expectation; for, before I was called on for money, I received one hundred pounds, which was left to me to apply to any part of the Lord's service where there seemed the most need. Feb. 2, 1848. This morning, on my walk before breakfast, I felt myself led out of my usual track into a direction in which I had not gone for some months. In stepping over a stile I said to myself: \"Perhaps God has a reason even in this.\" About five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards I met a Christian gentleman who gave me two sovereigns for the orphans, and then I knew the reason why I had been led this way.

The reflection of this same fiery glow lay upon the gray, weather-beaten stones of the old castle, upon the dark ivy which had woven around it its thick green meshes, while the wild, luxuriant vines hanging over the abyss, fluttered to and fro in the evening wind; and it lay also upon the faces of the two up yonder.

She had certainly always retained a mastery over...", "...of the dog. They then all took a most polite leave, and even begged the Heimlicher not to come into the street with them, as it mightn't be so easy to keep Mordax from a bite or so there.

He immediately became faint and insensible to surrounding objects; his complexion was livid, his breathing slow, and the perspiration saturated his clothes. At the end of an hour and a half he was bled, and recovered. On the 21st July, 1820, he was stung in the temple by a bumble bee. His wife was present and gave him some water, but in ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he was dead.--(_American Journal of Medical Sciences_, Vol. 19, p. 265. Philadelphia, 1836.) Two other rapidly fatal cases are noticed in the same journal, as well as two examples of death from the sting of a wasp and one from the bite of a spider. Mr. C.

In fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I await your highness here.\" She made another deep courtesy. The archduke, taking up the jest, approached her, and, kissing her hand, replied: \"I obey your imperial highness, as your loyal husband and loving subject.

The vessel's head was turned from the land. In ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> there was a joyous shout on board the Bonito, for the Genoese fleet was seen lying in the bay. The distant fleet must then form that of Pisani. \"See!\" Francis exclaimed. \"The Genoese have just caught sight of them, and are hoisting sail. They are either going to meet them or to run away.

Then he saw the source of the sound which had awakened him. Coming along the grass path, and not fifty paces from him, was a small pony and trap, driven by a woman. Antony looked towards it, and, as he looked, he felt his heart jump, leap, and set off pounding at a terrible rate.

CHAPTER XXXIV SINKING OF THE \"LUSITANIA\" On the 7th of May, 1915, came the most sensational act committed by German submarines since the war had started--the sinking of the Cunard liner _Lusitania_.

Originally, then, the Tennessee Synod was determined to be and to remain a purely German-speaking body. 88.

Moreover, in the minutes of the second convention, 1821, we read: \"At the request of some of our brethren of North Carolina it was resolved that there be annually a synod held in North Carolina, or in an adjoining State in the English language. The members of the German Tennessee Synod may also help to compose this Synod. It shall be governed agreeably to the same constitution as that of the German Tennessee Synod (the language...", "...they barely escaped running into a second Englishman, who was no other than Mr. Andrews.

There was a round clock upon the mantelpiece which ticked incessantly. It was a quick and hurried tick that came from the clock, and sometimes it seemed to be...", "...he worked ahead without question or comment. No orders were required; they laboured instinctively.

There came an ominous cracking sound; Agony uttered another shriek and turned away; the next instant the shrill cries of the bird ceased; the man in the chair gave vent to a long drawn \"Ah-h!\" Agony looked up to see the exhausted bird fluttering to the ground beside her, a length of string still hanging to its foot, while Mary slowly and carefully worked her way back to the trunk of the tree. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she slid to the ground and sat there, breathless and trembling, but triumphant. \"I got it!\" she panted. Then, turning to the man in the chair, she exclaimed, \"There now, who said it was impossible?\" The man applauded vigorously. \"That was the bravest act I have ever seen performed,\" he said admiringly. \"You're the right stuff, whoever you are, and I take my hat off to you.\" \"Anybody would have done it,\" murmured Mary modestly, as she rose and prepared to depart. \"How...", "...yet a coyote, complaining in the distance, seemed to set the world to a false note. Her mind seemed tangled in light as her eye, following the stars, was led along the devious invisible lines from one to another. She had a feeling as if she would like to look up the definition of \"you\" in the dictionary. When she came back to earth again, Jonas was sitting there awaiting her return. One would almost think he was waiting for an answer. Janet looked at her watch. It was twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after ten--but she did not know whether it was right or not. \"I hope I have n't been keeping you up, Miss Janet,\" said Jonas. \"Whenever your time comes to turn in, go right along.

By nine o'clock this was done, and the rest of the company was scattered in billets all over the village, being so tired that they flopped in the first place where there was floor space...", "...one cannot easily run away, and Red Pepper Burns was one of them. With all his powers of discernment, he had no possible notion that the two who followed him were not eager to accept this arrangement. They looked well together, too, he had observed as he neared them--exceedingly well. He was sure he was doing them a favour in keeping them together as long as possible. In point of actual distance he certainly succeeded literally in keeping them extremely near together, during the few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> it took to get out of a winding wood-road to the main highway, and to drive at a stimulating pace a mile down that road. When Leaver took his place upon the running-board he was unavoidably close to Charlotte's knee, and his head was within reach of her hand. His hand, grasping the only available hold with which to keep himself in place, as Burns let the car go at high speed, was close under her eyes. Keeping his eyes upon the road, Burns, in a gay mood now, kept up a...", "...just without the folding-doors, declaring there could be no breathing in the smaller apartment, and sent about the gentlemen for various refreshments; all which she rejected when they arrived, with extreme contempt, and a thousand fantastic grimaces.

Camilla and Eugenia were soon wholly engrossed by this new personage; and Lionel, seeing her surrounded by the most fashionable men of the assembly, forgot Mr. Dubster and his gloves, in an...", "...and a man nearly drowned. Meanwhile the tug was fast sinking. While they were throwing off their clothes, the Ninety-Nine came down, and stood off. On one hand was the enemy, on the other the water, with the shore half a mile distant. \"Do you surrender?\" called out Tarboe. \"Can't we come aboard without that?\" feebly urged Mr. Martin. \"I'll see you damned first, Mr. Martin. Come quick, or I'll give you what for.\" \"We surrender,\" answered the officer gently. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later he and his men were on board, with their rifles stacked in a corner at Bissonnette's hand. Then Tarboe brought the Ninety-Nine close to the wreck, and with his little cannon put a ball into her. This was the finish. She shook her nose, shivered, shot down like a duck, and was gone. Mr. Martin was sad even to tears. \"Now, my beauties,\" said Tarboe, \"now that I've got you safe, I'll show you the kind of cargo I've got.\" A moment afterwards he hoisted a keg on...", "...course and in that way have escaped the Indians.\" While I was talking with the women, I heard the tramp of horses' feet coming towards camp on the trail.

When they came up to us, he jumped off his horse and, clasping his wife in his arms he said, \"Oh Mary, I never expected to see you again.\" In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> everybody in camp was standing around those four men, and they surely had a dreadful story to tell. They said, they did not know how far they had ridden that morning when they sighted a band of Buffalo in a little valley.

He had, in fact, reached that state of blind unreasonableness said to be peculiar to hungry males from time immemorial. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of seven a key clicked in the lock of the outer door, and William and Billy entered the hall. It was almost dark. Bertram could not see their faces.

The Yugoslavs may have known what happened to Lieutenant (now Captain) Binnos de Pombara of the French navy. This officer, in command of the _Fourche_, had been escorting the _Citta di Messina_ and, observing that she was torpedoed, had sent to her, perhaps a little imprudently, all his life-boats and belts. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, when he was himself torpedoed, the Italians did not see him; anyhow they made for the shore. De Pombara encouraged his men by causing them to sing the Marseillaise and so forth; they were in the water, clinging to the wreckage, for several hours, until another boat came past. The next day at Brindisi, when he met the captain of the _Citta di Messina_, this gentleman once more did not see him; but the French Government, although de Pombara was a very young man, created...", "...form an important part of the ceremonial. I was assured that the jewels worn by the image of Nuestra Senora de la Imaculada Concepcion on the day of her festival exceeded 25,000 dollars in value. Numerous bands of music accompany the show.

One of the processions witnessed was forty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in passing, and of immense length, the whole way being lined with bearers of wax lights on both sides. There seems a rivalry among the religious orders as to whose displays shall be the most effective and imposing.

They are borne on the shoulders of their votaries, occupying a platform, whence they are visible to the crowd. [14] These religious ceremonials, so dear to, and so...", "...Highness is very pale.'

Nothing at Basingstead Minor seemed to have changed in five years, from the dun pony to the phloxes in the garden, from the fantail pigeons to the gardener who fed the pigs. Michael spent all the first few hours in rapid renewals of friendship with scenery and animals, dragging Alan at his heels and even suggesting about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before the gong would sound for dinner that they should bunk round and borrow the key of the tower on the hill. He and Alan slept up in the roof in a delightful impromptu of a room with uneven bare floor and sloping ceiling and above their beds a trap-door into an apple loft.

August was a blaze of blue and green and...", "...saw it, Sir,\" I persisted. \"Don't you talk back to me!\" he snapped, with a quick burst of temper. \"I won't have it!\" Then, just as suddenly, he was silent. He came a step towards me, and stared into my face. I believe the old ass thought I was a bit mad; anyway, without another word, he went to the break of the poop. \"Mr. Tulipson,\" he sung out. \"Yes, Sir,\" I heard the Second Mate reply. \"Send another man to the wheel.\" \"Very good, Sir,\" the Second answered.

I gave him the course, and he repeated it. \"What's up, mate?\" he asked me, as I stepped off the grating. \"Nothing much,\" I said, and went forrard to where the Skipper was standing on the break of the poop. I gave him the course; but the crabby old devil took no notice of me, whatever. When I got down on to the maindeck, I went up to the Second, and gave it to him. He answered me civilly enough, and then asked me what I had been...", "...whether the man had been caught. The officers of justice shook their heads. \"Double the reward at once,\" said Nicholson. This was done, but without any result. The same afternoon he inquired again it the fellow had been caught, and received the same answer, \"Not yet, my lord.\" The timorous officials added the suggestion that a very strong force of police would be necessary, as the man was surrounded by his kinsmen. \"Very well, then,\" said Nicholson, \"saddle my horse.\" A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later he rode off alone to the village in which the outlaw was sheltering, though, as a matter of fact, the latter walked about openly in little fear of capture. Almost the first person Nicholson met was the very man he had come to find. At his order to surrender the desperado rushed upon him with drawn sword. Nicholson calmly awaited the attack, and with a sweeping stroke of his own sword cut the man down.

'Oh, is _he_ Mr. Capadose?' said the young man, who appeared very vague. He admitted his vagueness and explained it by saying that there were so many people and he had come only the day before. What was definite to Lyon was that Mrs. Capadose was in love with her husband; so that he wished more than ever that he had married her.

Philadelphia, June 6, 1803. The plot thickens, and I do not find it possible to communicate faithfully the details, without hazarding too much in case of loss of the letter. Something, however, may be said. I called at the house this morning; before I had asked for any one in particular, the servant bid me in, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Inamorat sole appeared. This looked like secret understanding or sympathy; perhaps, however, it was only as head and representative of the family. She looked well; but, unfortunately, a trifling carelessness in dress had nearly concluded the farce. Recollecting, however, that they were packing up for a temporary removal, to take place this very day, an apology was obvious. Having made to myself the apology, I went further, and found that there was politeness, _at least_, in...", "...to put on their steel caps. There was noise and bustle in the enemy's camp, for the whole force were now under arms, and in their anger at the sudden blow which had been struck them, some bodies of men even moved forward toward the walls as if they intended to renew the assault of the previous day; but the showers of arrows with which they were greeted cooled their ardor, and they presently retired out of reach of bow-shot. There was a respite now for the besiegers. No longer every few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> did a heavy stone strike the walls. The morning's light enabled the defenders of the castle to see the extent of the damage which the battering machine had effected. None too soon had they put a stop to its work, for had it continued its operations another hour or two would have effected a breach. Already large portions of the wall facing it had fallen, and other portions were so seriously damaged that a few more blows would have leveled them. \"At any rate,\" Walter said...", "...which now devolved on Lieutenant Cracroft, who, however, continued to fight the ship as his captain had done. After being for some three hours entangled, the two ships separated, the _Vengeur_ tearing away the _Brunswick's_ anchor. As they drifted apart, some well-aimed shots from the _Brunswick_ smashed her enemy's rudder-post and knocked a large hole in the counter. At this moment the _Ramillies_, sailing up, opened fire at forty yards' distance at this particular hole. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she reduced the _Vengeur_ to a sinking condition, and then proceeded to chase the _Achille_. The _Vengeur_ now surrendered. The _Brunswick_, however, could render no assistance, all her boats being damaged, but, hoisting what sail she could, headed northward with the intention of making for port. During the fight the _Brunswick_ lost her mizzen, and had her other masts badly damaged, her rigging and sails cut to pieces, and twenty-three guns dismounted. She lost three officers...", "...cockneys. Almost at the same moment a countryman, stationed at the outside of the gorse, shouted \"Tally-ho!\" and the fox broke cover in gallant style, going away at a rattling pace, with four or five couple of hounds on his traces. In an instant all was confusion, cigars were thrown away, hats pressed firmly down upon the brow, and, with a rush like the outburst of some mighty torrent, the whole field to a man swept rapidly onward. In the meanwhile Fanny's mare, which had for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> shown symptoms of excitement, pawing the ground with her fore-foot, pricking up her ears, and tossing her head impatiently, began, as Lawless rode off, to plunge in a manner which threatened at every moment to unseat her rider, and as several horsemen dashed by her, becoming utterly unmanageable, she set off at a wild gallop, drowning in the clatter of her hoofs Fanny's agonised cry for help.

Last night about eleven o'clock Benton Sharp, with two other men, entered the Gold Front Restaurant and seated themselves at a table. Sharp had been drinking, and was loud and boisterous, as he always was when under the influence of liquor. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the party was seated a tall, well-dressed, elderly gentleman entered the restaurant. Few present recognized the Honourable Luke Standifer, the recently appointed Commissioner of Insurance, Statistics, and History. Going over to the same side where Sharp was, Mr. Standifer prepared to take a seat at the next table. In hanging his hat upon one of the hooks along the wall he let it fall upon Sharp's head. Sharp turned, being in an especially...", "...than the Mexicans themselves. On entering the parlour, they nodded a \"good-morning\" to me, rather coldly to be sure, for they had seen me talking with Bob, which probably did not much recommend me. Presently, four more horsemen rode up, and then a third party, so that there were now fourteen of them assembled, all decided-looking men, in the prime of life and strength. The judge, who slept in an adjoining room, had been awakened by the noise. I heard him jump out of bed, and not three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> elapsed before he entered the parlour. After he had shaken hands with all his visitors, he presented me to them, and I found that I was in the presence of no less important persons than the Ayuntamiento of San Felipe de Austin; and that two of my worthy countrymen were corregidors, one a procurador, and the others _buenos hombres_, or freeholders. They did not seem, however, to prize their titles much, for they addressed one another by their surnames only. The negro...", "...all was pretty quiet; the Duchess was blooded, and every body went to visit them. I hesitated, being afraid of an air of triumph: -however, lest it should be construed the other way, I went last night at eight o'clock; in the square I found a great multitude, not of weavers, but seemingly of Sunday-passengers. At the gate, guarded by grenadiers, I found so large a throng, that I had not only difficulty to make my way, though in my chariot, but was hissed and pelted; and in two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after, the glass of Lady Grosvenor's coach was broken, as those of Lady Cork's chair were entirely demolished afterwards. I found Bedford-house a perfect garrison, sustaining a siege, the court full of horse-guards, constables, and gentlemen. I told the Duke that however I might happen to differ with him in politics, this was a common cause, and that every body must feel equal indignation at it. In the mean time the mob grew so riotous, that they were forced to make both...", "...we sent no messenger to defeat the letter I bad so kindly written for them. But on this matter I gave myself no concern, as Elsie was as well acquainted with my wardrobe as I was, and would know at once that it contained no such articles as I mentioned; also, that the house had no south bedroom, and no bureau in the west room, neither was there a double team nor a farm wagon on the place. Consequently I had no fears that the letter was not faithfully fulfilling its mission. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before we left the hotel for the 8 o'clock train to return home a colored man came to James, evidently quite excited, and said: \"We have just heard there is a colored man here having trouble with slave-holders; if this is true, there are enough of us here to do whatever is necessary.\" James did not reply, but looked inquiringly at me. I replied, \"There is trouble,\" and taking him into a back room, gave him a brief sketch of James's experience. I told him I did not think it...", "...whither he would not. Moreover, there was the look of the burden-bearer in his eyes, though their fire was undimmed; and an air of belated sprightliness in his manner which went near to Myra's heart, because she knew it came of conscious effort.

Within two days the little squadron attacked the British frigate \"Belvidera,\" which had made herself obnoxious by her blockade of American ports, but lost her. On August 19 the frigate \"Constitution\", Captain Hull, met the British frigate \"Guerriere\", renowned for its unauthorized search of American vessels: in thirty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the \"Guerriere\" was taken; and the \"Constitution\" returned in triumph to Boston. The effects of this brilliant victory were immediately felt: New England shared in it; British naval prestige had received a damaging blow; and the Navy Department could no longer hope to keep the navy at home for police duty. Meantime the sloop-of-war \"Wasp\" had captured the British brig \"Frolic\" of equal force; and Decatur, in the frigate \"United States\", on October 25 took the British frigate...", "...here, it's impossible.

It's about two kilos from here. I shouldn't go if I were you unless you get further information; I am expecting another patrol in from there. If you care to wait a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> you may learn something.\" I agreed to wait, the \"still\" man came in just then, and he agreed to come with me. \"We may as well risk it,\" I said. \"I will take my old bus into the place. If Bosche sees it he may mistake it again for an armoured car.\" So, packing the cameras aboard, I waited for the expected patrol to turn up. Half an hour passed; no sign. Daylight was waning. \"I am going on,\" I said to the \"still\" man, \"we cannot wait for the patrol, there's not time....", "...She heard him sit down to the table, as if to begin supper though, Heaven knows, his appetite was slight enough after a reception which had confirmed his worst surmises. When Barbara had ascended the stairs and arrived in her chamber she sank down, and buried her face in the coverlet of the bed. Thus she remained for some time. The bed-chamber was over the dining- room, and presently as she knelt Barbara heard Willowes thrust back his chair, and rise to go into the hall. In five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> that figure would probably come up the stairs and confront her again; it,--this new and terrible form, that was not her husband's. In the loneliness of this night, with neither maid nor friend beside her, she lost all self-control, and at the first sound of his footstep on the stairs, without so much as flinging a cloak round her, she flew from the room, ran along the gallery to the back staircase, which she descended, and, unlocking the back door, let herself out.

Christine had taken up the paper. She did not know how to pass the evening; the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> seemed to be dragging past with deliberate slowness. She looked at the clock--only eight! She waited some time, then looked again. Five past. Why, surely the clock must have stopped; surely it must be half an hour since she had last glanced at its expressionless face. She sighed wearily.

At this moment the trot of a horse coming from the direction of Soulanges was heard, and five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the sheriff's officer fastened his horse to a post placed for the purpose near the wicket gate through which the cows were driven. Then he showed his head at the door of the Grand-I-Vert. \"Come, my boys, let's lose no time,\" he said, pretending to be in a hurry. \"Hey!\" said Vermichel. \"Here's a refractory, Monsieur Brunet; Pere Fourchon wants to drop off.\" \"He has had too many drops already,\" said the sheriff; \"but the law in this case does not require that he...", "...and I became engrossed in watching Captain Studleigh. Surely no one could be more popular; no one passed him without a word or a jest. I watched him as he bent over the white hands of fair ladies, and I was mad enough to feel something like jealousy when he seemed to like one. Then, by some accident, I can never remember how it happened, our eyes met. I saw him start, and I hoped he admired me. \"Ah, dear Heaven! what a foolish child I was! Then he went away hurriedly, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterward he was bowing before me, while some one introduced him to me. The extreme bitterness of the pain has long since left me, and I can remember that when he asked me to dance with him, and my hand touched his arm, it was as though the happiness of my life had suddenly grown complete. Thinking of myself as I was then, tears of pity fill my eyes. \"It was a long dance, and when it ended Captain Studleigh did not seem more anxious to part from me than I was to part from...", "...remounted, and set their horses at the ford, but all to no purpose. They tried again and again, and went plunging hither and thither, the horses foaming and rearing. 'Let us,' said the old trooper, 'ride back a little into the wood, and strike the river higher up.' They rode in under the boughs, the ground-ivy crackling under the hoofs, and the branches striking against their steel caps. After about twenty minutes' riding they came out again upon the river, and after another ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> found a place where it was possible to cross without sinking below the stirrups. The wood upon the other side was very thin, and broke the moonlight into long streams. The wind had arisen, and had begun to drive the clouds rapidly across the face of the moon, so that thin streams of light seemed to be dancing a grotesque dance among the scattered bushes and small fir-trees. The tops of the trees began also to moan, and the sound of it was like the voice of the dead in the wind;...", "...a day or two ago, which appears to have cleared the way to Kandahar.

It was a relief to him to hear it in the first instance not from Raby's lips, for he never knew what to do or say on such occasions. \"Miss Atherton must be very proud,\" said he, returning to his work. He was not, however, destined to remain long undisturbed. Raby, radiant and excited, entered the library a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later. \"Mr Jeffreys,\" said she, \"such splendid news. Has uncle told you?

Of course one can never tell in advance how people are going to take things, but he had chuckled and resolved to try it anyhow. So full was he of his scheme, even in sleep, that he awoke in an hour, and bathed, dressed and breakfasted at his usual time. On the slip of paper that Corinna had given Evan was written: Thomas Dordess, -- Broadway, Give Weir the bonds. C. PLAYFAIR. Evan presented himself at this address at a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past nine, when offices were just opening. Dordess, it appeared, was not a journalist, as Evan had once guessed, but an architect; that is to say, an elderly architectural draughtsman, one of the race of slaves who help build other men's reputations. Early as it was, Dordess had already been apprised of Evan's coming. Evan had only to look at him to know that.

Now reeling, now falling, he still dragged on his limbs as the instinct attracted him to that sign of refuge. He...", "...garments told a tale his lips would not. He understood without a word.

For some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an _escritoire_, took thence a letter...", "...next time be?\" whispered Betty with a chuckle. \"Now!\" whispered Valerie, and stepping out into the hall, they carefully closed the door, then ran softly along to Vera's door, and tapped upon the panel with a hat-pin for a knocker.

The street lamp threw a band of light across the room. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, the blankets were taken from the bed and hung over the door, that no ray of light from the room might be visible in the hall, through either crack or keyhole. A second blanket was pinned to the curtains, that neither coachman nor maid returning from the town might catch a glimpse of light. Then the fun began. They had become bolder, and forgetting to whisper, talked in undertones.

The...", "...the other, pulled the boat's head round, and made for the vessel. \"It's no use, Mr. Frere,\" said the man nearest him; \"we can do no good now, and they won't hurt us, I dare say.\" \"You dogs, you are in league with them,\" bursts out Frere, purple with indignation. \"Do you mutiny?\" \"Come, come, sir,\" returned the soldier, sulkily, \"this ain't the time to bully; and, as for mutiny, why, one man's about as good as another just now.\" This speech from the lips of a man who, but a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before, would have risked his life to obey orders of his officer, did more than an hour's reasoning to convince Maurice Frere of the hopelessness of resistance. His authority--born of circumstance, and supported by adventitious aid--had left him. The musket shot had reduced him to the ranks. He was now no more than anyone else; indeed, he was less than many, for those who held the firearms were the ruling powers. With a groan he resigned himself to his fate, and looking at the...", "...you know, the one we've talked about.\" \"Oh, yes, of course; do you mean to ask if he is in our family? Strange I never heard of it.\" \"There, listen, Lucian; this is what I mean. Mrs. Blair is mother's cousin, and her name, you know, is Audrey Balfour Blair.\" \"Has she a first name, and one so frivolous as 'Audrey'? How did that happen?\" \"That's just what I wish to know. I thought that perhaps you would remember whether her name was Balfour before her marriage.\" For a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Lucian seemed lost in reflection, then looking up he exclaimed,-- \"Yes, Martine, I am sure; Mrs. Blair's name was _not_ 'Balfour,' it was 'Tuck.' I once met a brother of hers. He was visiting Chicago. But, I'll tell you what--I am pretty sure that her grandmother was a Balfour. That's where the relationship to mamma comes in. You know that _her_ grandmother was a Balfour, and that's what makes them cousins; their grandmothers were sisters.\" \"Why, Lucian,\" cried Martine,...", "...no one without a previous appointment.\" I knew this quite well, for the \"Strangler of Finland,\" fearful of assassination, was as unapproachable as the Czar himself. Following the directions of the concierge, however, I crossed a great bare courtyard, and, ascending a wide stone staircase, was confronted by a servant, who, on hearing my inquiry took me into a waiting-room, and left with my card to Colonel Luganski, whom he informed me was the Baron's private secretary. After ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or so the man returned, saying: \"The Colonel will see you if you will please step this way,\" and following him he conducted me into the richly furnished private apartments of the Palace, across a great hall filled with fine paintings, and then up a long thickly-carpeted passage to a small, elegant room, where a tall bald-headed man in military uniform stood awaiting me. \"Your name is M'sieur Gregg,\" he exclaimed in very good French, \"and I understand you desire audience of...", "..._is_ a font in the chapel.\" \"Yes. I have often wondered why.\" Brother Copas appeared to meditate this as he slowly drew back his rod and made a fresh cast. Again the fly dropped short of the alder stump by a few inches, and fell delicately on the dark water below it. There was a splash--a soft gurgling sound dear to the angler's heart. Brother Copas's rod bent and relaxed to the brisk whirr of its reel as a trout took fly and hook and sucked them under. Then followed fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of glorious life. Even Brother Bonaday's slow blood caught the pulse of it. He watched, not daring to utter a sound, his limbs twitching nervously. But when the fish--in weight well over a pound--had been landed and lay, twitching too, in the grasses by the Mere bank, Brother Copas, after eyeing it a moment with legitimate pride, slowly wound up his reel. \"And I am to be a Protestant! . . . Saint Peter--King Fisherman-- forgive me!\" CHAPTER IV. CORONA...", "...forming a complete canopy, about an inch and a half above it. The repeated spiteful dartings of the bird past my ears, as I stood under the tree, caused me to suspect that I was intruding upon some one's privacy; and following it with my eye, I soon saw the nest, which was in process of construction. Adopting my usual tactics of secreting myself near by, I had the satisfaction of seeing the tiny artist at work. It was the female, unassisted by her mate. At intervals of two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she would appear with a small tuft of some cottony substance in her beak, dart a few times through and around the tree, and alighting quickly in the nest arrange the material she had brought, using her breast as a model. The other nest I discovered in a dense forest on the side of a mountain. The sitting bird was disturbed as I passed beneath her. The whirring of her wings arrested my attention, when, after a short pause, I had the good luck to see, through an opening in the...", "...get along without it, and yet not draw on the sacred fund at the bank. \"I suppose it is a good rule,\" Mary Burton said, \"though I never thought of doing such a thing. Well,\" after another thoughtful pause, \"I may as well begin, I suppose. I have a dollar a month to do what I like with. I'll give two dollars to the fund.\" \"Good!\" said Miss Benedict. \"Why, girls, we have a splendid beginning.\" But Mary Burton was an exception; not another girl in the group had an allowance. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of total silence followed; then a new type of character came to the front. \"Father gave me a dollar this morning to get me a new pair of gloves; but I suppose I can make the old ones do. I'll give that.\" \"O, Kate! your gloves look just horrid.\" This from a younger sister. \"I know they do, but I don't care,\" with a little laugh that belied the words; \"so does the church.\" \"That's true,\" said Anna Graves. \"It gives one the horrors just to think of it. I gave up all hope...", "...offer you Grand Opera. But if your taste inclines to the Movies--' \"'Get along, you silly,' she rebuked me.

Besides, it was nothing to boast of. I was a member of the Oxford Alpine Club, you know: and the water-pipe offered no difficulties. The stucco was in poor condition--I should say that it hardens more easily in Byzantium--but for difficulty there was nothing comparable with New College Chapel, or...", "...and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly. At last I says: \"This ain't no thirty-seven-year job; this is a thirty-eight-year job, Tom Sawyer.\" He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says: \"It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. If we was prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But _we_ can't fool along; we got to rush; we ain't got no time to spare. If we was to put in another night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well--couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner.\" \"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?\" \"I'll tell...", "...Billie was not slow to take the hint, and started for the hotel. He had not gone twenty paces when the two troopers who had ridden in with him overtook him. \"Just tell Captain Peak,\" said one of them, \"that there'll be ten of us waiting for you down below the custom house. We'll be in our shirt-sleeves, as it wouldn't do to be found dead in our uniforms if anything should happen.\" Billie's heart gave a great bound. \"I see,\" he said. \"You won't have to wait long.\" Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later he was in Captain Peak's room telling his story. In another ten minutes the two of them emerged from the hotel and walked swiftly down the street. In still another ten minutes, men who looked like cowboys, but each carrying a Winchester, might have been seen going toward the river below the custom house. Half an hour later the streets again took on a deserted appearance, save for the two or three policemen who suddenly emerged from unknown quarters and resumed their...", "...cartridges and flung them one by one at the tiger's head, striking it on the jaw and in the eye. The animal did not move. \"Seems dead enough,\" said the girl, lowering her rifle. \"Here come the beaters.\" The other elephants had now burst out in line through the scrub. Their _mahouts_ shouted enquiries to Gul Dad and when they heard of the tiger's death cheered gleefully, for it meant _backsheesh_ to them. Badshah was seen to be searching for a way down into the nullah and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> brought his passengers up alongside Miss Benson and the subaltern. Her father and Dermot congratulated the girl warmly; and the latter, having made Badshah kick the tiger to make certain that it was dead, dismounted and examined it. \"Here's your shot, Wargrave,\" he said, pointing to a hole in the belly. \"A bit too low, but it made a nasty wound that would have killed the beast eventually.\" \"I'm so ashamed of missing it with my second barrel, sir,\" said the subaltern. \"But...", "...of clerks, evidently discussing the case. It was no wonder, I felt, for the head of the firm was almost frantic, and beside the loss of his only daughter the loss of his business would count as nothing, at least until the keen edge of his grief was worn off. \"Mr. Gilbert is out,\" replied his secretary, in answer to our inquiry. \"Haven't you heard? They have just discovered the body of his daughter in a lonely spot in the Croton Aqueduct. The report came in from the police just a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago. It is thought that she was murdered in the city and carried there in an automobile.\" The news came with a stinging shock. I felt that, after all, we were too late. In another hour the extras would be out, and the news would be spread broadcast. The affair would be in the hands of the amateur detectives, and there was no telling how many promising clues might be lost. \"Dead!\" exclaimed Kennedy, as he jammed his hat on his head and bolted for the door. \"Hurry, Walter....", "...placed, so as to close the gullet. He then rubbed his eyelids with ghee (clarified butter) for some time, till he succeeded in opening them, when the eye appeared quite motionless and glazed. After the cake had been applied for the third time, to the top of the head, the body was convulsively heaved, the nostrils became violently inflated, respiration ensued, and the limbs began to assume a natural fulness. The servant then put some ghee on his tongue, and made him swallow it. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards, the eyeballs became slowly dilated, recovered their natural color, and the Fakeer, recognizing Runjeet Singh, sitting close by him, articulated, in a low sepulchral tone, scarcely audible--'_Do you believe me now?_'\" \"Runjeet Singh replied in the affirmative; and then began investing the Fakeer with a pearl necklace, a superb pair of gold bracelets, shawls, and pieces of silk and muslin, forming what is called a _khilet_, such as is usually conferred, by the...", "...own and Brand's scanty meal on a tray to the service-room. The unwearied lighthouse-keeper was on the balcony, answering a kindly signal from the Land's End, where the coast-guards were not yet in possession of the news from Penzance.

Brand was hoisting the last line of flags, when the American heard faltering footsteps on the stairs. \"Don't follow so close, Mamie,\" said a child's voice. \"My arm hurts just 'nuff for anything when I move.\" A towzled head of golden hair emerged into the light. It was one of the two little girls, whom Pyne had not seen since they were swung aloft from the sloping deck of the _Chinook_. Their astonishment was mutual. The child, aged about eight, recognized in him...", "...of three men, with a horse suited to his dignity, should meet him at the distance of a li from the fortress, and, as Bob had seen, he had ridden in to receive the submission of the garrison. The chief's story was hardly finished when one of the garrison came running in with a message. Sing-Cheng instantly went out into the courtyard. \"He say Manchu hab catchee one piecee Japanee,\" explained Ah-Sam. \"Follow the chief, and bring me word what is happening,\" said Bob. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed. Kobo was restless, his eyes wide open with a look of strained eagerness, his breath coming and going in quick feeble pants. Bob sat by his side, moistening his lips at intervals. Presently the door opened, and Ah-Sam first appeared, restraining a small gray-headed man, who seemed to be in haste to enter. \"One piecee boy Kobo San,\" said Ah-Sam to his master. The man came forward eagerly, and Bob saw that it was Taru, his friend's servant. The little Japanese flung...", "...to try to fix ourselves out for it.

Hugh pointed the larger ends of the poles and then told the boys to thrust them into the fire so that they might become charred and hardened. In that way they would last and be effective much longer. Then Hugh took a couple of sling-ropes off the pack saddles, and coiling them up, put one over his right shoulder and under his left arm, and gave the other to...", "...under water?

I thought it was rather neat for a clean-up.\" I thought so, too, and the King of the Street smiled at my exclamations over his cleverness. But my congratulations were cut short as a small dark man pressed his way to the corner where we stood, and whispered in Doddridge Knapp's ear. \"Was he sure?\" asked the King of the Street. \"Those were his exact words.\" \"When was this?\" \"Not five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago.\" \"Run to Caswell's. Tell him to wait for me.\" The messenger darted off and we followed briskly. Caswell, I found, was an attorney, and we were led at once to the inner office. \"Come in with me,\" said my employer. \"I expect I shall need you, and it will save explanations.\" The lawyer was a tall, thin man, with chalky, expressionless features, but his eyes gave life to his face with their keen, almost brilliant, vision. \"Decker's playing the joker,\" said the King...", "...telephone to his master. Indeed, the fair-haired girl had discussed with Valerie the advisability of so doing. \"Mr. Lyveden's a busy man, I fancy, and we hate worrying people. But he's simply devoted to the dog, and he's pretty bad.\" \"I think,\" said Valerie slowly, \"I think he ought to be told.\" \"Perhaps you're right, Miss French,\" said the girl. \"I'll go and ring up.\" She slipped out of the hospital, through the garden, and presently into her office. It was perhaps ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before she could speak with London. Then-- \"Is that Lord Banff's house?\" she inquired. \"Yes. Who are you?\" said an unpleasant voice. \"Oh, can I speak to Mr. Lyveden?\" \"_Who?_\" \"Mr. Lyveden.\" An exclamation of surprise came to her ears.... Then an oath.... Then a smothered laugh.... The girl frowned with impatience. At length-- \"Hullo,\" said the voice. \"Can I speak to Mr. Lyveden?\" she repeated. \"No, you can't. He's--he's out.\" \"Oh! Well, it's...", "...south. As I guessed then and was to learn later, forests are the surest sanctuary from these hideous creatures, which, with their enormous spread of wing and their great weight, are as much out of place among trees as is a seaplane. For a minute or so I clung there to my battered flyer, now useless beyond redemption, my brain numbed by the frightful catastrophe that had befallen me. All my plans for the succor of Bowen and Miss La Rue had depended upon this craft, and in a few brief <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> my own selfish love of adventure had wrecked their hopes and mine. And what effect it might have upon the future of the balance of the rescuing expedition I could not even guess. Their lives, too, might be sacrificed to my suicidal foolishness. That I was doomed seemed inevitable; but I can honestly say that the fate of my friends concerned me more greatly than did my own.

I shall use it again if I ever need to.\" Before a blazing fire kindled by Jean in the big fireplace, the whole party dried themselves. The old hunter listened to the story of their mad scramble through the woods with many expressions of sympathy.

Fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later they were telling Mr. and Mrs. Harlowe just how it all happened.

The time had come for herself and for her three chums to bind themselves together as a sorority. As charter members, they would initiate four other girls, as soon as proper rites could be thought of. It should be a...", "...of the currants breaking, and the seeds coming through into the jelly.

We sat down on the bank and held a long consultation. \"Well,\" said Billy at last, \"I'm willing to ask Scarlet Feather. She's ripping. Her _nose_ takes the cake; but, mind you, Gray Muff has the prettier _boots_. And I know Scarlet Feather has a watch--I saw the chain when we passed her just now.

He was white as the tablecloth and trembling all over. \"Come on!\" he gasped. \"I've found the very one! Quick, quick, or she'll be gone!\" \"Is it...", "...appears to have a deep interest in the queer things to be seen in the Arab village, for more than once he lingers behind to ask questions as he explains, in the hope of purchasing some article that has particularly caught his fancy.

She had removed the pressure and with it any true pathological cause of the theft impulse. She drew a bandage about the sleeping eyes. She made Patten bring his own saddle-blanket; it was fixed across the entrance of the anteroom of the King's Palace, darkening it.

Zeke handed him half-a-dozen matches. \"I dunno how many 'twill take,\" said John. \"S'pose we go round together and light up.

The smoke of five-and-twenty bonfires crawled up the hillside and completely hid John Penaluna's garden--hid the two figures standing there, hid the little summer-house at the top of the slope. It was enough to make a man swear, and Captain Tangye swore. John Penaluna drew a long breath. \"Well, good-bye and bless 'ee, Zeke. Hester's up in the summer-house. I won't go up with 'ee; my back's...", "...dragged from its hiding place, and Heinrich paddled it to the spot where the Goat-mother was resting on a snow-bank.

He had muttered something about \"making them sing a different tune in the morning,\" and then had gone clumping down the stairs. Five long hours, and now Dave couldn't stand the waiting any more. Every fiber of his entire being screamed for action. He had waited long enough to make their captors believe they were done in for the night. The guard had taken another look at them only a couple of <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago. It would be awhile before he looked in again. It was now, or never. It had to be!

He held one hand ready to clap it over the English boy's mouth in case he woke up with a startled yell, and put his lips close to Freddy's ear. \"Freddy, wake up!\" he breathed, and shook the youth gently with his other hand. \"I'm awake, Dave,\" came the whispered reply. \"Shall we try it now?\" \"Yes,\" Dave said. \"The guard...", "...concerning what is called the agricultural and manufacturing interests.

As the carriage drove away he went up to the room his mother was to occupy when she arrived next day, and looked to see if all was ready.

Let one of my little readers remark the length of five minutes when she or he, as the case may be, is busy and interested, and five minutes when they are standing idle, wondering what they shall do next, or perhaps grumbling because they are prevented doing something on which they had set their heart. Once a very small child, who was told to wait ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> for some reason, was seen to give the clock a great push and call it \"a stupid, tiresome thing\"--she was quite sure it had stopped just to tease her. She was too small to be able to tell the time herself, but nurse had shown her where the big hand would point when the ten minutes were up, and, oh dear! they were so long to that impatient little mortal who stood gazing up at it with such interest and anxiety. The last day came, and they all--that is, Mama, Auntie, Lena, Lucy,...", "...at a word. Flaming a dazzling white from the friction of the atmosphere through which she had torn her way, the _Boise_ slowed abruptly as she neared the ground, plunging toward the surface of the small but deep artificial lake below the Hill's steel apron. Into the cold waters the space-ship dove, and even before they could close over her, furious geysers of steam and boiling water erupted as the stubborn alloy gave up its heat to the cooling liquid. Endlessly the three necessary <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> dragged their slow way into time, but finally the water ceased boiling and Rodebush tore the ship from the lake and hurled her into the gaping doorway of her dock. The massive doors of the air-locks opened, and while the full crew of picked men hurried aboard with their personal equipment, Samms talked earnestly to the two scientists in the control room. \" ... and about half the fleet is still in the air.

This unexpected encounter surprized the ladies much more than I believe it will the sagacious reader, who must have imagined that the strange lady could be no other than Mrs Fitzpatrick, the cousin of Miss Western, whom we before mentioned to have sallied from the inn a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after her. So great was the surprize and joy which these two cousins conceived at this meeting (for they had formerly been most intimate acquaintance and friends, and had long lived together with their aunt Western), that it is impossible to recount half the congratulations which passed between them, before either asked a very natural question of the other, namely, whither she was going? This at last, however, came first from Mrs Fitzpatrick; but, easy and natural as the...", "...knocked one to the ground and began to pat it and pounce upon it. Then the bee, using Nature's weapon to preserve precious life, stung the kitten; and the kitten hopped into the air much amazed. It shook its paw, licked it, shook it again.

They connected the laugh with their dinner, but Joan's thoughts were all upon her own. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later Thomasin Tregenza called her, and, as they sat down, Tom arrived from school. He was a brown-faced, dark-eyed, black-haired youngster, good-looking enough, but not at that moment. \"Aw!

As notice was not given either in the church or Sabbath-school, the attendance was smaller than it otherwise would have been. Still, about sixty interesting children attended. After a few remarks concerning the object of the meeting by the superintendent of the Sabbath-school they sung with melting eyes the hymn that describes the wretched heathen mother casting her lovely babe into the jaws of the monster of the Granges. Prayer then was made, of about two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in length. Then I gave some of the most affecting accounts of the cruelties and ignorance of the heathen, as related by the devoted Williams, that martyr missionary. Their silent attention and subdued countenances told that their hearts were with the wretched idolaters.

He might be hungry, but his breath indicated that he had been drinking. Mrs. Gregory would gladly have dismissed him, but she was afraid to do so. If only her husband had been at home! \"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I will find you something.\" She went to the pantry and returned with some bread and cold meat, which she set before her uncouth visitor. \"If you will wait five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I will make you some tea,\" she said. \"I don't want any slops,\" said her visitor, scornfully. \"Give me brandy.\" \"I have none.\" \"Then whisky, gin--anything!\" \"We don't keep liquors in the house.

While he worked away, evidently filling his pockets, the interest of the onlookers became more and more...", "...and broil on the other side. Place on a hot platter, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dot with bits of butter and garnish with a little parsley or watercress. A rump or sirloin steak may be broiled in a hot frying pan in a similar way. Wipe and trim the steak, place in a smoking hot frying pan and sear both sides. Reduce the heat and turn the steak occasionally (about every 2 minutes) until it is cooked, allowing 8 minutes for a rare steak, 10 minutes for medium cooked steak, and 12 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> for well done steak, for a steak 1 inch thick. Avoid puncturing the meat with a fork while cooking. Many people prefer to broil a steak on a broiler.

He went to the farthest limit of the walk without meeting a single friend. There he sat down on a bench to rest.

The enemy showed several novel variations of old plays and twice made first down before she was finally forced to kick on Alton's forty-two yards. She was master of the shift and sent her plays at the long or short side of the line with beautiful and confusing impartiality. Also, her backfield was composed of slim, fast and elusive youths who had a remarkable faculty of slipping out of the opponents' clutches. In brief, it became apparent during the first few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of play that the home team was destined to have her hands full that afternoon and would be supremely fortunate if she kept her goal-line inviolate. The first quarter, however, passed without either team reaching scoring distance. There was much punting, at which Alton was slightly superior, and many attempts at end running by Lorimer, some of which succeeded. Only one forward-pass was tried, and that, by the enemy, went wrong and landed the ball in Alton's hands. The latter...", "...back, severely wounded.

Priscilla slept very poorly that night. Her dreams were troubled. And each time she woke, which was on the average of once an hour, she had a dreadful sense of impending disaster. On each occasion it took her several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to convince herself that nothing was wrong, that instead she was a very fortunate and happy girl, singled out of the world of girls by a most unusual young man. And thus reassured, she would drop off to sleep, to start again with troubled dreams, and to go again through the whole program. Owing to her restless night, Priscilla overslept and had to dress in a hurry to avoid being late to breakfast. By expedition she reached the dining room just after her mother had seated...", "...Mr. Ledward the surgeon, and Lawrence Lebogue, an old hardy seaman, appeared to be giving way very fast.

I issued about two ounces to each person, including the offals, and saved the remainder for dinner the next day.

Well--so far as I am concerned I will have nothing to do with the trick.\" During this harangue Marcus had alternately gazed at the floor and fixed his large eyes in anguish on his brother's face. For some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he found nothing to reply, and he was evidently going through a bitter mental struggle. Demetrius spoke no more, but arranged the sheets of papyrus that strewed the table. At length Marcus, after a deep sigh, broke out in a tone of fervent conviction and with a blissful smile that lighted up his whole face: \"Poor mother! And others misunderstand her just as you do; I myself was in danger of doubting her. But I think that now I understand her perfectly. She loved my father so...", "...I was not in a state of health fit for such a journey as that then was. So it was decided that your father should go first, and get a home ready for me.

Every time he opened the door they grinned at him, hoping he would come in and would do something delightful and amusing. But Kolya was bothered and did not go in. At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind, once for all, that if that \"damned\" Agafya did not come back within ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he should go out without waiting for her, making \"the kids\" promise, of course, to be brave when he was away, not to be naughty, not to cry from fright.

Hitching it suddenly on its back again, she repeated the operation until it had had enough. In regard to quantity, she regulated herself by feeling its stomach. In the matter of drink she was more pronounced than a teetotaler, for she gave it none at all.

Good-bye and good fortune!\" He took the hand she gave him and held it a moment. \"I wonder whether your last wish will ever be realized, If so, I shall come to thank you, even in England.\" Then he turned and went out with hurried steps, wondering what had led him to break through the reserve he had prudently determined to maintain. What he had said might mean nothing, but it might mean much. He had seen Millicent Graham for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in her father's house, and afterwards met her every day during the week spent in Montreal, but brief as their friendship had been, he had yielded to her charm. Had he been free to seek her love he would eagerly have done so, but he was not free. He was an outcast, engaged in a desperate attempt to repair his fortune. Miss Graham knew this, and had probably taken his remarks for what they were worth as a piece of sentimental gallantry, but something in her manner suggested a...", "...a luxury.

The water taken internally and externally soothed Harry's nerves. His excitement was gone. A great army with which they were sure to fight on the morrow was not far away, but for the time he was indifferent. The morrow could take care of itself. It was night, and he had permission to go to sleep. Hence he slumbered fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later. He slept almost through the night, and, when he was awakened shortly before dawn, he found that his strength and elasticity had returned. He and Dalton went down to the spring again, drank many times, and then ate breakfast with the older members of the staff, a breakfast that differed very little from that of the common soldiers. Then a day or two of waiting, and watching, and of confused but terrible fighting ensued. The forests were again set on fire by the...", "...Sometimes I used to be unkind, and I wished for worldly pleasures, for dancing and the theater.

These, imitating his example, wheeled also; but before they had fairly turned themselves in the ravine, the \"cached\" horsemen sprang out in a body from the rocks and came galloping down. The Indians, now seeing that they were completely in the trap, with overpowering numbers on both sides of them, threw down their spears and begged for mercy. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they were all captured. The whole affair did not occupy half an hour; and, with our prisoners securely tied, we returned to the spring. The leading men now gathered around Seguin to settle on some plan for attacking the town. Should we move on to it that night?

Then came the call to march, and with a last prayer the boys filed silently out into the night and fell into line. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later the steady tramp of their feet could be heard as they went down the street that led to the front. Later in the night, quite near to morning, there came a terrific shock of artillery fire that heralded a German raid.

In fact, she was less than five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> out of her house; but when she returned to it, she found it empty. First she noted with a moderate thrill of surprise that her visitor had gone away leaving his potatoes untouched, and next, with a rough shock of dismay, that her cloak no longer lay on the window seat where she had left it. From that moment she never felt any real doubts about what had befallen her, though for some time she kept on trying to conjure them up, and searched wildly round and round and round her...", "...but to direct another there--no, that is out of the question.

It was not long before Elaine was ready, and from the stable a groom led three of the best trained cross-country horses in the neighborhood, for old Taylor Dodge, Elaine's father, had been passionately fond of hunting, as had been both Elaine and Aunt Josephine. We met on the porch and a few minutes later mounted and cantered away. On the road Del Mar joined us and we galloped...", "...shudder and rub the back of his head. 'Feel the wind?' he said.

All he does, is to make me more charitable to those who give way to him. I believe in a devil.' 'Horns and tail?' 'Bait and hook.' 'I haven't wealth, and I wish only for dinner,' Fenellan said. 'You know that Armandine is never two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> late. By the way, you haven't wealth--you have me.'

She and Win were going West--there was a ranch for sale--and ... she suddenly realized that she was uncomfortable. Her shoulders and hips ached. Where was she? She felt cold. She tried to move and the effort caused her pain. She heard a sound nearby and opened her eyes. She closed them and opened them again. She was lying upon the ground among trees and two horses stood a short distance away. The horses...", "...While the ship slid on past Castle William and poked her nose toward the forts at the Narrows, I watched the distant pier which we had left.

We turned off to a caravanserai, mostly a heap of ruins, the roofs having given way under the weight of the snow, and there I sought some relief from pain by lying down for the short thirty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> which could be spared in the _seraidar's_ damp room. It was then growing late in the afternoon, all landmarks had disappeared in a brooding mist, there were no habitations, and no human beings of whom to ask the way.

At least nothing that should trouble me!\" \"But what is it?\" \"Well then, papa, dear, here has been a foolish girl--_very_ foolish, I think she must be, going about, intruding even into the Castle, and telling all that will listen to her, that _she_ is betrothed to the Marquis of Arondelle.\" \"Oh!...", "...and Albert. At last, toward eleven o'clock, the people who were looking through the telescopes cried out \"There they are!\"--and sure enough, far up, on the loftiest terraces of the Grand Plateau, the three pygmies appeared, climbing with remarkable vigor and spirit. They disappeared in the \"Corridor,\" and were lost to sight during an hour. Then they reappeared, and were presently seen standing together upon the extreme summit of Mont Blanc. So, all was well. They remained a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> on that highest point of land in Europe, a target for all the telescopes, and were then seen to begin descent. Suddenly all three vanished. An instant after, they appeared again, TWO THOUSAND FEET BELOW! Evidently, they had tripped and been shot down an almost perpendicular slope of ice to a point where it joined the border of the upper glacier. Naturally, the distant witness supposed they were now looking upon three corpses; so they could hardly believe their eyes when...", "...through the wide hall and out of the solemn old house, wondering if ever again Anna Percival would cross its entrance-porch.

Kino saw me safely outside of the gate by way of gratitude. I walked on toward the parsonage. Redleaf seemed very silent, almost deserted. I met none of the villagers in my homeward walk. \"It will be ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> yet ere Sophie and Aaron will, waiting, say, 'I wonder why Anna does not come,'\" I thought, as I drew near, and my fingers held the tower-key.

I had until this day known only sister Sophie, and in my heart I thanked Miss Axtell for her story. I went in to look at Mary's grave. A sweet perfume...", "...which exasperated me, later, almost to self-contempt. A crimson cord hung at one side of my bed, continued from a bell-wire at some distance, the tassel of which I touched lightly, and, at the very first signal, Mrs. Clayton appeared through the hitherto only unopened door, to know and do my bidding. The clock on the mantel-shelf struck nine as she stood beside me, and made respectful inquiries concerning my wants and condition; understanding which, she disappeared, to return a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, followed by an ancient negress, bearing a silver waiter. I recognized in this sable assistant (or thought I recognized at a glance) my companion in shipwreck; but, upon making known my convictions, was met with a prompt denial by the sable dame herself, who, shaking her head, gave me to understand, in a few broken words, that she \"no understood English--only Spanish tongue!\" Her dress--handsome and Frenchified--her creole coiffure, and the long gray locks that...", "...not master anything in the world, when he could take off for fifteen minutes and gain fifteen hours.

The young lawyer paused for a moment in amazement on seeing in the dim light the strange client who awaited him.

Then he passed to the subject of his stewardship. Why had he put that trust money into a concern without sufficient investigation?

Steve had expected to have to wait a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the gymnasium, then there would be a step outside and the old man would enter. The beauty of this, to Steve's mind, was that he himself would be \"discovered,\" as the stage term is; the onus of entering and opening the conversation would be on Mr. Bannister.

You dive down the first little hollow until you strike a rill of water, for water is a prime necessity. As you draw your hatchet you take in the whole situation at a glance. The little stream is gurgling downward in a half choked frozen way. There is a huge sodden hemlock lying across it. One clip of the hatchet shows it will peel. There is plenty of smaller timber standing around; long, slim poles, with a tuft of foliage on top. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> suffice to drop one of these, cut a twelve-foot pole from it, sharpen the pole at each end, jam one end into the ground and the other into the rough back of a scraggy hemlock and there is your ridge pole. Now go--with your hatchet--for the bushiest and most promising young hemlocks within reach. Drop them and draw them to camp rapidly. Next, you need a fire. There are fifty hard, resinous limbs sticking up from the prone hemlock; lop off a few of these and split the largest...", "...that had been hired for the evening, had just arrived, and falling to work immediately he had poured all the blanc-mange down the sink, mistaking it for bonnyclabber.[1] This intelligence was almost too much to bear, and Mrs. Marsden could scarcely speak for vexation.

Away, and show your face no more, let what will happen.\" Drusa departed, but in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she again put in her head at the parlour door and said, \"Ma'am, may I jist speak one time more?\" \"What now?\" exclaimed Mrs. Marsden. \"Oh! there's nothing else spiled or flung down the sink, jist now,\" said Drusa, \"but something's at hand a heap worse than all. Missus's old Aunt Quimby has jist landed from the boat, and is coming up the road with baggage enough to last all summer.\" \"Aunt Quimby!\" exclaimed Albina; \"this indeed caps the climax!\" \"Was there ever anything...", "...Fortunately I want nothing for myself, and it is no use being a victorious general if one cannot utilize it in some way; so I am quite glad to have something to ask the king.\" The next day Ronald presented himself at the hotel of Marshal Saxe and rode by the side of his carriage out to Versailles. The king, surrounded by a brilliant train of courtiers, received the marshal with the greatest warmth, and after talking to him for some time retired with him into his private closet. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later one of the royal pages came out into the audience chamber and said in a loud voice that the king desired the presence of Monsieur Ronald Leslie. Greatly embarrassed at finding himself the centre of observation not unmingled with envy at the summons, Ronald followed the page into the presence of the king, who was alone with Marshal Saxe. Louis, who was in high good humour, gave Ronald his hand to kiss, saying: \"I told the marshal to recall your name to me, and he has...", "...my principles. I explain the cause and effect, and I point out the remedies. Is this not the proper way for an author to proceed? The practice of this and some other principles that I explain in this work, will place in the rank of choice horses, animals whose inferiority caused them to be considered jades, and that the old method would never have raised from their degradation. It will suffice to accustom the horse to trot well, to exercise him at this pace only five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in each lesson. When he acquires the necessary ease and lightness, he can be made to execute ordinary _pirouettes_, as well as the exercise on two lines, at a walk and a trot. I have said that five minutes of trotting were enough at first, because it is less the continuance of an exercise than its being properly done that perfects the execution of it. Besides, as this pace requires a considerable displacement of forces, and as the animal will have been already subjected to a...", "...away. \"The best I can--for the house--and for myself. . . . I talk to you because I know you're a lady and because I don't want to see you thrown down. A woman that's living quietly at home--like a lady--she can be squeamish. But out in the world a woman can't afford to be--no, nor a man, neither.

But her attitude at this moment, her wild, haggard face, and imploring eyes, were full of revelation to me. Another possible explanation of her lonely, joyless life and deep religious devotion flashed in upon me. Might it not be the dreary expiation, the hard penance of her church meted out for sin? Half fearing to disturb her, I remained for a brief while silent, but, as the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> went on, the sight of her agony was too much for me and I cried out to her: \"Mother, I am here. I did not know that you were up! I came in through the window!\" At the first sound of my appealing tones her face changed, as though frozen suddenly from passionate expressiveness to cold marble. Slowly she rose to her feet and confronted me. \"Mother, are you in trouble?\" I said softly, moving nearer to her; \"cannot I share your sorrow? Cannot I comfort you? Why am I shut out...", "...sentinel paced his beat about fifty yards from the clump of bushes in which our tunnel was to come up, and as he slowly walked up and down, probably thinking of home and friends and wishing for his relief, he was suddenly startled by the sight of several dark forms springing apparently from the bowels of the earth. The tunnel had been miscalculated, and the men emerged several feet from the bushes, in full view of the sentry. He was so astounded that he stood stock still for several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> without uttering a sound, during which time about fifty men had climbed out of the tunnel and made a streak for liberty. Suddenly the sentry came to his senses, fired his gun, called loudly for the guard, and ran to the mouth of the tunnel, with his bayonet ready for action. Those who had not entered the tunnel concluded that they did not want to escape that night, and we returned to our quarters in the stockade. Over fifty got out and away, but the guards put the dogs...", "...III: REMARKS ON THE VARIATION OF THE NEEDLE. On the 6th of November, I was in 49 degrees 4 minutes south latitude, and in the longitude of 114 degrees 56 minutes; the variation was at this time 26 degrees westward; and, as the weather was foggy, with hard gales, and a rolling sea from the south-west and from the south, I concluded from thence that it was not at all probable there should be any land between those two points. On November 15th I was in the latitude of 44 degrees 33 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> south, and in the longitude of 140 degrees 32 minutes. The variation was then 18 degrees 30 minutes west, which variation decreased every day, in such a manner, that, on the 21st of the same month, being in the longitude of 158 degrees, I observed the variation to be no more than 4 degrees. On the 22nd of that month, the needle was in continual agitation, without resting in any of the eight points; which led me to conjecture that we were near some mine of loadstone. This...", "...at Commander Winslow's arm. \"Don, do you think it could be a Scorpion scout, coming back to investigate?\" \"It could be!\" the young officer decided swiftly. \"In any case, this changes our plans. Boatswain! Shove off at once in the launch with Miss Colby. Get her safely aboard the gunboat and then come back. Lieutenant Pennington and I will evacuate the other men from the underground base. Hurry, Red!\" He turned and raced up the beach, followed by the stocky junior officer. Two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later he paused at the rim of a huge steel cylinder whose bulk appeared to be sunk deep in the earth. Thick jungle growth had sprawled across the great tank's top, hiding it completely from the beach. One hand on the hatchway leading to the cylinder's interior, Don Winslow waited for his friend to catch up. \"What in thunder's all the hurry, Don?\" the red-headed lieutenant gasped, stumbling through the underbrush. \"Even if that is a Scorpion plane up there, it wouldn't dare...", "...of the other teachers stopping there, talked a few minutes in the hall, went to the office desk for mail, and slowly ascended the stairs, thinking intently. What she thought was: \"If I am not mistaken, my hat did a small bit of execution to-night.\" She stepped to her room to lock the door and stopped a few minutes to arrange the clothing she had discarded when she dressed hurriedly before going to the concert, then, the letters in her hand, she opened Mrs. Jardine's door. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before, there had been a tap on that same door. \"Come in,\" said Mrs. Jardine, expecting Kate or Jennie Weeks. She slowly lifted her eyes and faced a tall, slender man standing there. \"John Jardine, what in the world are you doing here?\" she demanded after the manner of mothers, \"and what in this world has happened to you?\" \"Does it show on me like that?\" he stammered. \"Was your train in a wreck? Are you in trouble?\" she asked. \"Something shows plainly enough, but I...", "...and spies intermix themselves against my playfulness, and spoil the fruit, perhaps--who knows? only you and Flintwinch--when it is just ripe. Thus, madame, I am here for the last time. Listen! Definitely the last.'

I'll not leave it till then, or you'll cheat me. Pay it! Count me the money!' 'Take it from his hand and pay it, Flintwinch,' said Mrs Clennam. He spirted it into Mr Flintwinch's face when the old man advanced to take it, and held forth his hand, repeating noisily, 'Pay it! Count it out! Good money!'

I am sure Captain Parkson----\" \"Lieutenant Parkson,\" corrected the young man. \"Lieutenant Parkson will join me.\" Five minutes later Lieutenant Parkson was comfortably seated in a chair on the opposite side of the hearth. He was consuming one of Mrs. Beecher Monmouth's buff-coloured cigarettes, and was very much at home drinking some of Mrs. Beecher Monmouth's after-dinner coffee. After the first few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he gathered together his natural self-possession. He was generally at home where women were concerned, and he was intensely susceptible to feminine beauty. At that particular moment he was flattering himself that he was making a good impression upon this rich and beautiful young widow. It occurred to him that she was, in the circumstances, unduly cheerful, but he attributed this to his own good company. The fact that Mrs. Beecher Monmouth had cunningly put him in this frame...", "...knows now; but we keep to ourselves as much as possible. There've been times when we've had company--too much; but I made up my mind they should die alone. You can go up, though.\" \"Thanks. You can go to sleep, if you wish.\" Cochrane led him down the hall with its beautiful inlaid floor, scratched and dull, up the wide stair with its faded velvet carpet, and opened the door of a large front room. \"The drops on the table are to be given every hour, sir; the next at twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to two.\" He closed the door and went away. The curtains of the room were wide apart. The sun flaunted itself upon the old carpet, the handsome old-fashioned furniture. Thorpe went straight to the windows, and drew the curtains together, then walked slowly to the bed. Nina lay with her eyes open, watching him intently. Her face was pallid and sunken; but she looked less unlike her old self. She took his hand and pressed it feebly. \"I am sorry I spoke so roughly the other...", "...the foremost soldier on either side, bore with fortitude the reproaches of his countrymen, and Davis loyally supported his old friend. Johnston then marched to join Beauregard at Corinth, Miss., and with the united forces took the offensive against Grant's army at Pittsburg Landing. The battle of Shiloh (q.v.) took place on the 6th and 7th of April, 1862. The Federals were completely surprised, and Johnston was in the full tide of success when he fell mortally wounded. He died a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> afterwards. President Davis said, in his message to the Confederate Congress, \"Without doing injustice to the living, it may safely be said that our loss is irreparable,\" and the subsequent history of the war in the west went far to prove the truth of his eulogy.

Sometimes he came alone, sometimes in company; and by a carefully thought out system of tips he usually managed to have reserved for him at least until one o'clock a particular seat in a particular partition in that row of stable-like shelters that run the length of the room opposite the door on the first floor.

Breakfast had been served at both ends of the yacht to the watch below, so that they were in readiness to come on duty at the striking of the bell. Breakfast was ready for those who came off watch as soon as they were relieved. Pitts had his hands more than full in supplying the two tables, but he was assisted by the idlers about the boat.

He was like a man who had awakened from a long sleep full of dreams to find that, whilst he had slumbered, a deadly peril had come down on him, a peril which could be averted only by immediate action. Jimmy had ordered a drink, more or less mechanically, as a tribute levied by the house; but he pushed it away untasted. \"I'm going to be absolutely sober when I do this,\" he muttered, then went back into the hall, where he spent five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> poring over a timetable, following the trains down the lines of figures with a finger which trembled slightly. Every hour seemed of supreme importance now. Had he not been in dreamland for over a year? At last he found his trains. He had three hours to wait in the town, two hours in London; but he would finally arrive in the little Yorkshire town about half-past seven in the morning, before Lalage had started work in that hateful little shop. There was no need for him to...", "...play. Wentworth was hurled back, and there was a net loss of two yards to Clifford. \"Look out for a kick!\" warned Frank. It came, for Clifford was desperately afraid, and Comfort got the ball. Tucking it under his arm, with head down, he started for the goal line, well protected. The enraged Clifford players managed to get at him, however, and he was downed after he had covered fifteen yards. But it was a good run back, and Columbia had the ball, and there were still several more <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to play. \"At 'em now, fellows! Tear 'em apart!\" cried Lanky Wallace. He called for Ralph West to take the ball around Smith, as the quarter had noticed the weak defense the right end was putting up. Around circled West, and he made a good gain before he was downed. Again came smashing plays--several of them, Columbia keeping possession of the ball. In vain did Clifford brace and hold. It was useless. She was being shoved right up the field. Her men were exhausted and...", "...accept your offer, because I am innocent, and I know that though Cambyses is hasty, he is not unjust. Come friends, I think the king will give us a hearing to-day, late as it is.\" CHAPTER III. Two hours later Bartja and his friends were standing before the king. The gigantic man was seated on his golden throne; he was pale and his eyes looked sunken; two physicians stood waiting behind him with all kinds of instruments and vessels in their hands. Cambyses had, only a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before, recovered consciousness, after lying for more than an hour in one of those awful fits, so destructive both to mind and body, which we call epileptic.

See Herod, III. 33.] Since Nitetis' arrival he had been free from this illness; but it had seized him to-day with fearful violence, owing...", "...I was sure that I had killed him. The reader may judge how high these hopes rose when a moment or two later a note was handed to the chairman who then asked me to pause for a moment in my lecture and stood up and asked, \"Is there a doctor in the audience?\" A doctor rose and silently went out. The lecture continued; but there was no more laughter; my aim had now become to kill another of them and they knew it. They were aware that if they started laughing they might die. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a second note was handed to the chairman. He announced very gravely, \"A second doctor is wanted.\" The lecture went on in deeper silence than ever. All the audience were waiting for a third announcement. It came. A new message was handed to the chairman. He rose and said, \"If Mr. Murchison, the undertaker, is in the audience, will he kindly step outside.\" That man, I regret to say, got well. Disappointing though it is to read it, he recovered. I sent back next morning from...", "...she demanded, eager as a child to start on the adventure. \"A boat,\" said Antony, looking over the ship's side, \"will be with us in a couple of moments I should say, to judge by the strength of the rower's arms. He has been racing the other fellows, and will be first at his goal.\" \"Then come,\" she said. \"Let us be first too. I don't want to lose a minute.\" Antony followed in her wake. Her sentiments most assuredly were his. It was not a day of which to squander one iota. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later they were on their way to the shore. Behind them the _Fort Salisbury_ loomed up large and black from the limpid water; before them lay the land of possibilities. The other passengers in the boat kept up a running fire of comments. A stout gentleman in a sun-helmet, which he considered _de rigeur_ as long as he was anywhere at all near the regions of Africa, gazed towards the shore through a pair of field-glasses. At intervals he made known such objects of interest as he...", "...My name, if that means anything to you, is Francis Strong, and I have assumed this character of a mountebank solely for the purpose of going about the country without being molested. What I hope to do, is of no interest to any one but myself.\" It was a straightforward statement and the boys saw no reason to doubt its truthfulness. \"All right, then,\" exclaimed Billie. \"Here goes!\" He grasped the rope and lowered himself over the side. It was as Strong had said and in a very few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he found himself at the bottom. He could see nothing except the dim light at the mouth of the shaft. Giving the rope a vigorous shake, as had been agreed upon, he saw another figure begin to descend, and in a short time Pedro stood beside him. Strong was next to descend, then came Ambrosio, and after him Adrian and Donald in the order named--Donald having determined to be the last, that he might be sure that everything was safe above ground. \"I should have given you...", "...review the place generally, I and my orderly walked off some half-mile to the north of the river. As we were going some distance, we doffed our helmets and wrapped ourselves in two beautiful orange and magenta striped blankets, borrowed from our Kaffir lady guests, in case any stray Boer should be lurking around, as he might be interested to see two \"khakis\" wandering about on the veldt. It was awkward trying to walk with our rifles hidden under our blankets, and, moreover, every two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we had to look around to see if the sentry at the camp had signalled any enemy in sight. This was to be done by raising a pole on the highest hut. The result of our work was splendid. We saw a Kaffir kraal on a hill, and to us \"it was nothing more.\" There were the heaps of _debris_ usually round a kraal, looking most natural, but no heads were visible, and no trenches. There was only one fault, and that was that a few thoughtless men began, as we looked, to spread their brown...", "...to pots being broken up and used as bullets. Almost incredible stories are told by black men and white in Cameroons concerning the efficiency of these poultices; one I heard from a very reliable white authority there of a man who had been shot with bits of iron pot in the thigh. The white doctor extracted several pieces, and declared he had got them all out; but the man went on suffering and could not walk, so finally a country doctor was called in, and he applied his poultice. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> he removed it, and on its face lay two pieces of iron pot. The white doctor said they had been in the poultice all the time, but he did not carry public opinion with him, for the patient recovered rapidly.

'I made a bet I'd drive you out of the Park, old Roy!' 'Ride behind, then,' said my father, and to my astonishment Edbury obeyed him, with laughter. Lady Edbury smiled to herself; and I experienced the esteem I perceived in her for a masterful manner. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later my father beckoned me to pay my respects to Graf Kesensky, an ambassador with strong English predilections and some influence among us. He asked me if he was right in supposing I wished to enter Parliament. I said he was, wondering at the interest a foreigner could find in it. The count stopped a quiet-pacing gentleman. Bramhaxri DeWitt joined them, and a group of friends. I was introduced to Mr. Beauchamp Hill, the Government whip, who begged me to call on him with...", "...Down Dropped the Bag.] Down Dropped the Bag. Pausing only long enough to learn that Jack's pulses were beating, and that the submarine boy was breathing, Truax stole off into the night, carrying the bag of sand under his overcoat.

Then he opened his eyes; after a while he managed to sit up. \"Ugh!\" he grunted. \"What's the odor? Liquor! How does that happen? Oh, my head!\" He got slowly to his feet, using the board fence as a means to help steady himself. Then, though he found himself weak and tormented by the pain in his head, Benson managed to feel his way along the fence until he came to the opening made by the loose board....", "...had never been under fire before. Looking up calmly, he said, \"Mr. Gilmore, I'm hit.\" In a moment another bullet struck him in the chest and came out of his arm pit. With his attention riveted on his task, he remarked, \"I'm hit again, Mr. Gilmore.\" Only a moment later another ball grazed the side of his head and cut a painful wound in his scalp. \"Mr. Gilmore, they've hit me again,\" he muttered, while he kept on working at the gun, with blood running down all over him. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a fourth ball passed through the lad's ankle, one of the most painful parts of the body in which to get shot. This time, with a slight tremble in his voice, he said, \"Mr. Gilmore, I'm hit once more; but I've fixed your gun, Sir.\" Just at this moment the Filipinos saw that the Americans' fire had practically ceased.

During the reading of the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of the preliminary meeting by the Secretary, much uneasiness was manifested concerning the low voices of women, and cries of \"Louder, louder!\" drowned every other sound, when the President, on rising, said: Friends, we present ourselves here before you, as an oppressed class, with trembling frames and faltering tongues, and we do not expect to be able to speak so as to be heard by all at first, but we trust we shall have the sympathy of the audience, and...", "...serve for the ever hungry \"Hawkeye\" next morning. I was beginning to think I would have to disguise some \"left-overs\" under a new name, as the thrifty housekeeper knows how to do, when my colleague, my faithful yoke-fellow, who has many a time found for me a spring of water in the desert place--the Brakeman, came down the aisle of the car. He glanced at the tablet and pencil as I would look at his lantern, put my right hand into a cordial compress that abode with my fingers for ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after he went away, and seating himself easily on the arm of the seat, put the semaphore all right for me by saying: \"Say, I went to church yesterday.\" \"Good boy,\" I said, \"and what church did you attend?\" \"Guess,\" was his reply. \"Some Union Mission chapel?\" I ventured. \"N-no,\" he said, \"I don't care to run on these branch roads very much. I don't get a chance to go to church every Sunday, and when I can go, I like to run on the main line, where your trip is regular,...", "...a difficult matter for the tipsy party to get at his watch; but he was in an obliging mood, and after some trouble succeeded in clutching the timepiece. \"Come here an' see for yourself,\" he said, after trying in vain to make out the position of the hands. \"I reckon I must have bought four or five watches by the looks of these, though I'm blest if I remember anything about it.\" \"You've only got one there,\" Jet said, as he gazed over the stranger's shoulder. \"It lacks only ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of being twelve o'clock; I shan't have long to wait.\" \"I'd stay with you if I didn't have to call upon a sick friend,\" the man replied after some difficulty, and then he staggered on, while Jet paced to and fro as if only by exercise could he control his impatience. In less than five minutes he was joined by two men, or at least they came on the platform; but seemingly took care to prevent him from seeing their faces. He could hear them talking in low, earnest tones; but...", "...an' valises.\" \"Mr. Crow is a famous detective,\" explained Miss Banks. Anderson attempted to assume an unconscious pose, but in leaning back he missed the end of the bench, and sat sprawling upon the lap of Mrs. Harbaugh. As Mrs. Harbaugh had little or no lap to speak of, his downward course was diverted but not stayed. He landed on the floor with a grunt that broke simultaneously with the lady's squeak; a fraction of a second later a roar of laughter swept the room. It was many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before quiet was restored and the \"match\" could be opened. Mrs. Cartwill chose Mrs. Farnsworth and her rival selected the husband of the dashing young woman. Mr. Reddon firmly and significantly announced his determination to sit near the teacher \"to preserve order,\" and not enter the contest of words. Possibly it was the presence of the strangers that rattled and unnerved the famed spellers of both sides, for it was not long until the lines had dwindled to almost nothing....", "...rang out from hilarious groups who had already passed me. I felt anxious to know what it was that thus set all Portsmouth laughing, and glanced round to see if I could discover an acquaintance of whom I might inquire; but, as usual in such cases, was unsuccessful. When I reached the Common I found, as I expected I should, a large and fashionably dressed crowd, with a good sprinkling of naval and military uniforms, listening to the strains of the band. Here, for the first five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or so, I failed to notice anything unusual in the behaviour of the people; but the humorous item of news must have reached them almost simultaneously with my own arrival upon the scene, for very soon I detected on the faces of those who passed me the same amused smile which I had before encountered in the streets. I stood well back out of the thick of the crowd; both because I could hear the music better, and also to afford any friend of mine who might chance to be present an...", "...direction, though he was evidently terrified by some threat of punishment and his eyes filled with tears. Finding him obstinate, they desisted from their purpose, and I was quite edified to see the little fellow continue to look away from the spectacle which attracted all other eyes but his. The white boy now came forward, touched the hat of the little black, and goodnaturedly saying \"_pontelo, pontelo_\"[7] made him put it on his head. The crowd now began to disperse, and in twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the place was nearly solitary, except the sentinels pacing backward and forward. Two hours afterward the sentinels were pacing there yet, and the dead man, in his white dress and iron collar, was still in his seat on the platform. It is generally the natives of Africa by whom these murders are committed; the negroes born in the country are of a more yielding temper. They have better learned the art of avoiding punishment, and submit to it more patiently when inflicted, having...", "...States\" wearing, while this conversation was in progress, precipitated Carden's action. He interpreted the manoeuvre as indicating a wish to get to windward, which the \"Macedonian's\" then course, far off the wind, would favor. He therefore hurriedly gave the order to haul up (2), cutting adrift the topmast studdingsail; a circumstance which to seamen will explain exactly the relative situations. That he had rightly interpreted Decatur's purpose seems probable, for in fifteen or twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the \"United States\" again wore (_a_), resuming her original course, by the wind on the port tack, the \"Macedonian\" continuing on the starboard; the two now running on lines nearly parallel, in opposite directions (_b b_).

The British ship did not reply, but shortly afterward wore (_c_), and, heading now in the same general...", "...think of nothing but the want of an engineer that would prevent Washburn from coming through on time. While I was thinking about it, and worrying a little, I heard some one on deck say she was coming; and I felt ashamed of myself for doubting, even for a moment, the loyalty of Ben Bowman. I left my room and went aft. I saw one of those peculiar Florida boats coming around the bend below us. I sent for my spy-glass, and soon made out the name of the Wetumpka on the pilot-house. In ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more she came alongside the Sylvania. I had not seen the craft I was to command before, and I had no little curiosity to look her over. Washburn received me when I went on board, and we shook hands, for we had been separated for nearly two days, a longer time than for months before. \"What makes you so late? I was afraid something had happened to you,\" I began. \"Are we not on time?\" asked the mate. \"We were to be here on Monday forenoon; and it is only eleven...", "...move about from room to room to their recitations has been in use for nearly a month, and there has been sufficient opportunity for testing its practicability and its advantages. There is no doubt that the new system alters the old form of recesses, shortening the two regular ones, but giving three minutes between recitations as a compensation for this loss. Although theoretically we have more recess time than formerly, in the practical working out of the system we find that the three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> between recitations is occupied in gathering up one's books, and reaching the next recitation room; besides this, that there is often some confusion in reaching the various classrooms, and that there are many little inconveniences which would not occur were we sitting at our own desks. On the other hand, as an offset to these disadvantages, there is the advantage of a change of position, and a respite from close attention, with a breathing spell in which to get the mind as well...", "...knowing where I was, or what relation the place in which I stood bore to the castle as a whole. Now and then I would ascend a flight of stone steps at the side of a courtyard and come out unexpectedly upon what seemed to be a flat roof, from which I could see the entrance to the harbor and the white walls of the Estrella battery hundreds of feet below; but as soon as I went back into the maze of passages, chambers, and bastions on that level, I lost all sense of direction, and five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later I could not tell whether I was on the northern side of the castle or the southern side, nor whether I was in the second of the three cubes of masonry or the third. The most surprising thing about the castle, to me, was its lack of offensive power. Its massive stone walls gave it, of course, a certain capacity for endurance, and even for resistance of a passive kind; but it was almost as incapable of inflicting injury on an enemy as a Dutch dike or a hillock of the...", "...ill? I had never known him have a day's illness in his life. And even so he might have telegraphed. Some awful accident must have happened to him. The thought that he had played her false never--no, not for a moment--entered my head. Yes, something terrible had happened to him, and on me lay the task of telling his bride. I almost wished the carriage would upset and break my head so that some one else might tell her, not I, who--but that's nothing to do with his story. It was five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to four as we drew up at the churchyard gate. A double row of eager on-lookers lined the path from lychgate to porch. I sprang from the carriage and passed up between them. Our gardener had a good front place near the door. I stopped. \"Are they waiting still, Byles?\" I asked, simply to gain time, for of course I knew they were by the waiting crowd's attentive attitude. \"Waiting, sir? No, no, sir; why, it must be over by now.\" \"Over!

You satisfy her as far as you can, and then, feeling how fast the precious <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> are passing, you try, oh so earnestly, to buy them up and fill them with eternity work, when suddenly the whole community concentrates itself upon your Tamil sister. Who is she? You had waived the question at the outset, knowing what would sequel it, but they renew the charge.

In any case it avenges me of you.\" \"It is to death that you are proceeding.\" \"I hope so; but you only asked of me a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> for conversation. They have nearly passed. Spare me then, Senor, speaking anymore to me, for I shall not answer you. Moreover, I perceive that your bandits are resuming their journey.\" Indeed, the caravan began to descend the slope of the mountain, the path narrowed more and more, and a long conversation became absolutely impossible. \"Oh; curses on you,\" cried the marquis with rage. The young girl only answered by a burst of mocking laughter.

He saw that her bosom heaved, but on her face there was no foreboding of tears.

He did not hesitate, but pressed on with his little band, quite unnoticed by the attacking force, coming upon their rear in the darkness just as they were receiving a check from the brave defenders of the camp, and the Captain poured in volley after volley so unexpectedly that the French broke, and began to retreat before their foes. The Major, grasping what had occurred, turned his defence into a brave attack, and the result was that in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the enemy was in full retreat, and soon after, this in their confusion became a rout.

But the Colonel, she owned, behaved...", "...presently have Jan lording it over his own father--eh, Finn, boy!\" The wolfhound had been gravely watching the weighing operation, and now nuzzled the Master's hand, his invariable method of answering unimportant inquiries of this sort. Then he walked forward and good-humoredly sniffed round the puppy's head; whereupon Jan impudently bit at his wolfhound father's gray beard, and had to be rolled over on his back under one of Finn's massive fore feet. There followed upon this a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> of romping that was most amusing to watch. Little Jan would rush forward at Finn, growling ferociously. Finn would spread out his fore legs widely, and lower his great frame till his muzzle almost reached the ground, while his tail waved high astern. Just as the bellicose pup reached his muzzle, Finn would spring forward or sideways, often clean over Jan, alighting at some little distance, and wheeling round upon the still growling pup with a grin that said, plainly: \"Missed...", "...the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon.

Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness.

We had better,\" he added, \"let the claret alone till we return from Cockenzie.

But Samuel knew better than to quarrel with the attorney at that juncture; so he answered him in the affirmative; and, in five minutes afterwards, the heir and the lawyer were in a coach, driving off to Cockenzie.

Jasper got into his car and drove back to the street that would take him out to the suburb of Rosebank. As he left Fandall Avenue he peered at his watch.

At a quarter past seven he passed through the main street of Rosebank, and turned into a lane that was but little changed since the time when it had been a country road.

I had not long to do so, for immediately after I had reached the spot, he arrived in an open barouche and four posters, with three other young men, to whom he severally introduced me, but whose names I have totally forgotten; I only remember that two of the party were military men then quartered in town.

He had evidently made friends with them, and they rested their white breasts close on the margin, seeking to claim his notice with a low hissing salutation, which, it is to be hoped, they changed for something less sibilant in that famous song with which they depart this life. Darrell looked up. \"They come to be fed,\" said he, \"smooth emblems of the great social union....", "...found his sister sitting with Judith Macpherson and her grandson, Cluny. Cluny was not seriously hurt, but no man comes out of a life-and-death fight with the sea, and feels physically the better for it.

Why should _she_ spend her tired <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in praying, after the whole house was asleep? and why was it that Elizabeth could not set her down as a fool for her pains? And on the contrary there grew up in her mind, on the instant, a respect for the whole family that wrapped them about like a halo. One morning when Elizabeth came through the kitchen to mount her horse, Mrs. Landholm was doing some fine ironing. The blue habit stopped a moment by the ironing-table. \"How dreadfully busy you are, Mrs. Landholm.\" \"Not...", "...shout that went up when the troops moved forward died away, and the tapping of the drums broke sharply through a brief silence that was almost portentous.

Some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed. \"Yes, it's clear he won't come to-night,\" she said at last raising her head. \"It's late.\" \"He will come to-morrow,\" I said in the most firm and convincing tone. \"Yes,\" she added with no sign of her former depression. \"I see for myself now that he could not come till to-morrow. Well, good-bye, till to-morrow. If it rains perhaps I shall not come. But the day after to-morrow, I shall come. I shall come for certain, whatever happens; be sure to be here, I want to...", "...as the thought of her faithful companion came to her mind for the time. \"Agatha! Where is she?\" asked Tournay almost impatiently, chafing at a moment's delay. \"At the Citizeness Privat's in the Rue Vaugirard. They will surely find and arrest her. Robert, we must not let them.\" \"The delay may mean the difference between life and death,\" replied Tournay, turning in the direction of the Rue Vaugirard; \"but we must not let Agatha fall into Robespierre's clutches.\" In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they passed up the Rue Vaugirard. \"Which is the house?\" asked Tournay anxiously. \"There; the small one with the blinds drawn down. Agatha will be anxiously waiting for me, I know. There she is now in the doorway. She sees us! Agatha, quick! Never mind your hat or cloak. Ask no questions. Now Robert, take us where you will.\" Passing Edme's arm through his own, and with Agatha on the other side, Tournay conducted the two women rapidly down the street. At the same moment...", "...after a few brief words with the Ambassador, hurried away to his task. In twenty minutes he stood before a tall, grey-stone building, a few blocks away, was admitted by a Japanese butler, and conducted, after some hesitation, into a large room at the back of the house. An elderly man, dressed for the evening, with the lapel of his coat covered with orders, was awaiting him. \"I am a stranger to you, Baron,\" Lutchester began. \"That does not matter,\" was the grave reply. \"Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> ago I had an urgent telephone call from our mutual friend. His Excellency told me that he was sending a special messenger, and begged me to give you a few minutes. I have left a conference of some importance, and I am here.\" \"A few minutes will be enough,\" Lutchester promised. \"I am engaged by the English Government upon Secret Service work. I came to America, following a man named Fischer. You have heard of him?\" \"I have heard of him,\" the Ambassador acknowledged. \"In...", "...friends interposed, and tried to arrange the difficulty; but Dr. Jeffries swore that he would not leave the ground till some one had been killed. The principals were therefore put up again. At the second exchange of shots Dr. Smith's right arm was broken, when he gallantly declared that, as he was wounded, it would be gratifying to his feelings, to be killed. Third exchange of shots, and Dr. Smith, firing with his left arm, hits his man in the thigh, causing immense loss of blood. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> were occupied in bandaging the wound; when Dr. Jeffries, properly primed with brandy, requested that no further obstacles might be raised between him and satisfaction. For a fourth time the mad men were put up--at the distance of six feet. The result was fatal to both. Dr. Smith dropped dead with a ball in his heart. Dr. Jeffries was shot through the breast, and survived only a few hours. The conduct of Dr. Jeffries during those last few hours was admirable, and most...", "...and a sullen grunt Duggan went on. An hour later the trail narrowed into a short canon, and this canon, to Keith's surprise, opened suddenly into a beautiful valley, a narrow oasis of green hugged in between the two ranges. Scarcely had they entered it, when Duggan raised his voice in a series of wild yells and began firing his rifle into the air. \"Home-coming,\" he explained to Keith, after he was done. \"Cabin's just over that bulge. Be there in ten minutes.\" In less than ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Keith saw it, sheltered in the edge of a thick growth of cedar and spruce from which its timbers had been taken. It was a larger cabin than he had expected to see--twice, three times as large. \"How did you do it alone!\" he exclaimed in admiration. \"It's a wonder, Andy. Big enough for--for a whole family!\" \"Half a dozen Indians happened along, an' I hired 'em,\" explained Duggan. \"Thought I might as well make it big enough, Johnny, seein' I had plenty of help. Sometimes I...", "...of which there is no duplicate at court. After that I sent three telegrams. One to papa, announcing that I was going to Brighton; another to the Palace Hotel in Brighton; a third to the Minister of Railways, commanding that my saloon carriage be coupled to the Continental express night after next. I knew, of course, that the King would be informed of these messages in a twinkling. I waited an hour for the Powers to move; as a rule it takes them a week or ten days. Exactly sixty-five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after sending my letter to the King, Frederick Augustus rode into the courtyard like a madman. He had been hurriedly summoned from the drill-grounds, I heard afterwards. He dismounted at the stairs leading to the King's apartments. Half an hour later, he slunk into my room, as serious as a corpse. There wasn't a trace of brutality in his voice as he said: \"A fine row you kicked up.\" I didn't favor him by questions, but kept looking out of the window. He walked up and down...", "...us, the more quickly and vigorously we do it. The first necessity is to find ourselves out--to find out for a fact when we do hurry, and how we hurry, and how we have the sense of hurry with us all the time. Having willingly, and gladly, found ourselves out, the remedy is straight before us. Nature is on the side of leisure and will come to our aid with higher standards of quiet, the possibilities of which are always in every one's brain, if we only look to find them. To sit five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> quietly taking long breaths to get a sense of leisure every day will be of very great help--and then when we find ourselves hurrying, let us stop and recall the best quiet we know--that need only take a few seconds, and the gain is sure to follow. _Festina lente_ (hasten slowly) should be in the back of our brains all day and every day. \"'T is haste makes waste, the sage avers, And instances are far too plenty; Whene'er the hasty impulse stirs, Put on the brake, Festina...", "...Garcia did not reply, but an expression, grim and sardonic, overspread the features of the Sergeant. \"For other reasons also it is perhaps as well,\" he said; \"for had I been chosen, an accident might have happened to a grandee of Spain!\" CHAPTER XLVI THE SERGENT'S LAST SALUTE It was almost time for starting. The two sentries lay on their faces, trussed and helpless, with gags in their mouths. El Sarria and Rollo had dropped down upon them as if from the clouds a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the officer had made his two-hourly visitation. The Sergeant was ready with the horses in the hollow, keeping them quiet with cunning gipsy caresses and making soft whistling _chalan_ noises in their ears. So far all had gone well, and Rollo, standing with his knife in suggestive proximity to the tied-up sentries, silently congratulated himself. The dawn was doubtless coming up behind the hills to the east, but the darkness was still absolute as ever about the camp,...", "...I could see how he held his hand on her saddle and supported her in the rough places. Poor child, who would have thought she could bear such terrible work! But she had the blood of a soldierly old race in her veins, and would have struggled on silently till she died. I think it would be useless to describe every stone on the desolate journey, but when the morning dawned we were at the top, and we found the descent much easier. The rosy streaks came first, quite suddenly, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the sun was up, and the eventful night was past. I was never so glad to get rid of a night in my life. It is fortunate that I am so thin and light, for I could never have reached the high-road alive had I been as fat as De Pretis is; and certainly the little donkey would have died by the way. He was quite as thin when I sold him again as when I bought him, a fortnight before, in spite of the bread I had given him. Hedwig drew her veil close about her face as the daylight...", "...reaching our anchorage off the Mole of Gibraltar, after giving the necessary orders for the disposal and refitting of his squadron, he returned to his cabin with a deep sense of the responsibility he had incurred; but supported by the unqualified conviction that every exertion had been made to obtain success, and that the disappointment resulted from circumstances over which he had no control. The action terminated, as appears by the log, at thirty-five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after one; and the squadron proceeded to Gibraltar. As soon as the ship was secured, the Admiral sent me on shore to the governor, to relate to him the events of the two preceding days. I found him sitting in his balcony, which commanded a view of the Bay and Algeziras, evidently deeply affected by the unlooked-for termination of an attack upon the French squadron, and anxiously reflecting on the probable results. On my return on board, the Admiral had...", "...son,--the staff of the widow's declining years. 1 Mr. E. J. Loomis, assistant in charge of the \"Nautical Almanac\" office, Washington, D.C., under date of Aug. 1,1871, says,-- \"Referring to the 'Nautical Almanac' for 1857, I find, that, between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock on the night of the 29th of August, 1857, the moon was within one hour of setting. \"The computed time of its setting on that night is 11 h. 57 m.,--three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before midnight. \"The moon was only two days past its first quarter, and could hardly be mistaken for 'nearly full.'\" \"In the case of the People vs. Armstrong, I was assisting prosecuting counsel. The prevailing belief at that time, and I may also say at the present, in Cass County, was as follows:-- \"Mr. Lincoln, previous to the trial, handed an almanac of the year previous to the murder to an officer of the court, stating...", "...impatience to be off. Just then galloped up one of the Emperor's aids, saying, \"Colonel, the Emperor desires you to charge directly on the enemy's batteries opposite your position.\" The brave colonel, who was one of Napoleon's personal favorites, though chafing at the prolonged inaction of his command, pointed to the marsh, and requested the officer to inform the Emperor of the obstacle in his front, with the existence of which his majesty, he said, was probably unacquainted. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the officer came riding furiously back with a message to the colonel, that \"if he did not immediately charge, the Emperor would come and lead the regiment himself.\" Stung by this reproof, the colonel plunged his spurs into his horse's flanks, and giving the command \"Forward,\" led his regiment, at full gallop, directly through the marsh upon the point that had been indicated. The charge itself was, of course, a failure. The regiment finally struggled its way through the marsh...", "...expecting there would be trouble before morning in this home of his, else why had he warned us against making any outcry or movement if we heard aught that might alarm? Surely his angry visitors could hardly be friends of the Cause, for they would not dare raise their voices so high lest the attention of the patrol be attracted, and if they were not of our people, why was this man, so greatly to be trusted by us \"rebels,\" having any connection with them? Before we had been awake three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> came a clattering as if the table was overturned, and I distinguished sounds betokening the splintering of wood, telling that some article of furniture had been destroyed, while above such noises came the trampling of heavy feet, and shouts, and cries. When this disturbance was at its height Hiram ran toward the ladder as if it was his intent to ascend, despite the warning which had been given; but I clutched his arm, holding him back by main strength as I said in a hoarse...", "...last Saturday night, to note the close of his seventy-first year, and the late curious and unquestionable \"boom\" of the old man's wide-spreading popularity, and that of his \"Leaves of Grass.\" There were thirty-five in the room, mostly young, but some old, or beginning to be. The great feature was Ingersoll's utterance. It was probably, in its way, the most admirable specimen of modern oratory hitherto delivered in the English language, immense as such praise may sound. It was 40 to 50 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> long, altogether without notes, in a good voice, low enough and not too low, style easy, rather colloquial (over and over again saying \"you\" to Whitman who sat opposite,) sometimes markedly impassion'd, once or twice humorous--amid his whole speech, from interior fires and volition, pulsating and swaying like a first-class Andalusian dancer. And such a critical dissection, and flattering summary! The Whitmanites for the first time in their lives were fully satisfied; and that...", "...the whistle?\" \"I heard something a little while ago, a sort of an ear-piercing shriek that startled me, and caused me to nick my chin with the razor. I shall have to put a bit of flesh-coloured plaster over it. Was that the whistle?\" asked the Honourable John in the most tantalising, nonchalant way, as if he had all the day before him. We looked up the stairway, and there he was on the landing, in his shirt-sleeves, slowly adjusting the ends of a salmon-coloured tie. \"The two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> are up,\" said I, replacing my watch, and stooping for my portmanteau. At that moment the whistle sounded again, and I hurried away, followed by Syd, both of us muttering that the dawdler deserved to be left, but none the less hoping in our hearts that he would be in time. The hotel was near the harbour, and we were soon aboard. On the bridge, between the paddle-boxes, the captain stood with the string attached to the syren in his hand; beside him, glancing at the...", "...of their flanks, parallel to them with an intervening distance of six miles. They were evidently not aware that he was so close to them. As soon as we received the report concerning the British, we left Sanna's Post in haste. We required no urging on. For were we not encouraged by our recent success, and was there not every chance of achieving another? We left Sanna's Post a little before sunset, and that whole night we rode on without off-saddling once. We did not halt save for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to rest our horses. Early the following morning a third report, pressing us to increase our speed and leave behind those whose horses were too tired to proceed rapidly, reached us. De Wet was most anxious to occupy a ridge in front of the enemy, between the farms Mostert's Hoek and Sterkfontein. The road leading to Reddersburg from Dewetsdorp traverses this ridge. Hence it was absolutely necessary to seize it before the enemy if we were to intercept them. So on we went,...", "...tongue.

In one minute the ears were in rapid convulsive motion, and, presently after, tremors and violent convulsions extended over the body and limbs. In three and an half minutes the animal fell upon the side senseless and breathless, and the heart had ceased to beat. Slight tremors of the voluntary muscles, particularly of the limbs, continued, more or less, for nineteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the animal was dead. Those of the right side were observed to be more and longer affected than those of the left. Half an hour after death the body was opened, and the stomach and intestines were found to be contracted and _firm_, as from a violent and permanent spasm of the muscular coat. The lungs were empty and collapsed. The left side of the heart, the aorta and its great branches were loaded with black blood. The right side of the heart and the two cavae contained...", "...if I do!\" said Hildreth, fiercely. \"Oh, yes, you will; just the bare facts, you know.

I dragged the trembling women out of the carriage, and one minute later it rolled down the abyss crashing into a thousand pieces. I am a strong man, but I confess that all my strength was required to keep myself and the two women from falling over the precipice until ropes were thrown to us from above. Atossa hung round my neck, and Kassandane lay on my breast, supported by my left arm; with the right I fastened the rope round my waist, we were drawn up, and I found myself a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later on the high-road--your mother and sister were saved. \"As soon as one of the Magi had bound up the wounds cut by the rope in my side, the king sent for me, gave me the chain I am now wearing and the revenues of an entire satrapy, and then took me to his mother and sister.

Their day started finely and augured well. Preparing their tackle they lost no time in lowering an alluring bait to the finny denizens of the water. Evidently the fish were hungry for not many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> passed before Harry felt a tug at his line. He began reeling in rapidly. \"Oh, what a whopper,\" exclaimed Arnold peering over the side of the boat. \"It's as long as my arm and big as a good sized stove pipe, I believe. One or two like that will be enough.\" \"Thanks,\" panted Harry. \"Wait till I get this one.\" Skillfully the lad drew the fish to a point where he could be sure of landing it without danger. Then he waited for his chum to assist with the landing net. The fish...", "...use of his name he could at least make sure that she should know he was at her door, and he determined to make the attempt.

At last the porter returned, and, bowing to the ground, said that the Signora Duchessa would receive him.

At last he went to the phone again. He waited for some time before it was answered, and he was compelled to make the man inside repeat frequently. The new series of stratagems was without result. Before he went again to his labours, he addressed the group. \"Air getting pretty bad, I guess.\" \"Is it dark?\" one of them asked tremulously. \"No.\" Fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> more.

An hour later planes came out to meet them, circling overhead, like guardian wings to watch them safely into port. And then at last their first glimpse of a foreign shore.

Peter asked himself where his kinsman had learned to paint like that. He almost gasped at the composition of the thing and at the drawing of the difficult arms. Biddy abstained from looking round the corner of the canvas as she held it; she only watched, in Peter's eyes, for this gentleman's impression of it. That she easily caught, and he measured her impression--her impression of _his_ impression--when he went after a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to relieve her. She let him lift the thing out of her grasp; he moved it and rested it, so that they could still see it, against the high back of a chair. \"It's tremendously good,\" he then handsomely pronounced. \"Dear, dear Nick,\" Biddy murmured, looking at it now. \"Poor, poor Julia!\" Peter was prompted to exclaim in a different tone.

If so, the crowd is up the trail. If they're comin' by, it'll be 'fore dark. We'll stop in this 'ere tavern.

From the cave's entrance they looked upon the undulating green roof of...", "...Mallow noticed particularly how Jewish she was in appearance, and wondered how he could have been so blind as not to have remarked it before. The room looked cheerful and warm, and was welcome after the chilly, dreary streets. Mallow, having taken off his overcoat in the hall, came forward and bowed somewhat formally, but Maraquito was not to be put off with so frigid a greeting. Holding out both hands, she shook his warmly and pointed to a chair near her couch. It was now a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after nine. \"How good of you to come and see me,\" she said in her deep, rich voice. \"The evening was so dull.\" \"You are not having any play this evening?\" Maraquito shrugged her fine shoulders and unfurled a quite unnecessary fan, which, to keep up her fiction of being a Spanish lady, she always carried. \"Some idiot told the police what was going on and I received a notice to close.\" \"But the police knew long ago.\" \"Not officially. The police can be silent when it...", "...not a cheer being raised at the prospect of meeting the enemy. The ship was cleared for action, and as she passed out, the Shannon was waiting for her on an easy bowline. Both ships proceeded under a good breeze until about thirty miles beyond Boston Light. They then came together under short fighting canvas, and in the manoeuvring for a few moments Lawrence was in position to rake his enemy; but whether it escaped him, or he preferred to fight it out alongside, is not known. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before six, the ships being fairly alongside, and not more than fifty yards apart, the Shannon fired her first broadside, and was immediately answered by the Chesapeake. The effect of these first broadsides in smooth water and close range was terrific. Three men at the Chesapeake's wheel were shot down one after another. Within six minutes her sails were so shot to pieces that she came up into the wind and was raked repeatedly. In a short while Captain Lawrence was shot in the...", "...Andrew's wife lies on her death-bed, poor woman.' 'Yes; but, Elspeth, you sit there in the dark.' 'Eh, but it is peaceful and quiet-like, and the Lord bides with me, \"and darkness and light are both alike to him,\"' finished Elspeth reverently. And then I heard the click of the gate, and rose hastily, only the baby cried as I laid her on Elspeth's lap, and I had to stay a moment to pacify her. Mr. Hamilton came in and stood by us. 'Do not hurry yourself; I can easily wait a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> if you are not ready. Are you sure you are not too tired to come?' he continued, looking at me a little inquisitively, and I was certain that he noticed the trace of tears on my face. Why was it I never could speak of my darling quite calmly? 'I am perfectly ready, and baby has left off crying,' I returned, taking up my basket, and then we left the house together.

He would pass right by the Sleeping Water Inn. Why should he not pause there for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and make some arrangement with Rose about Narcisse, who was still in Boston? He certainly had a duty to perform towards the child. Would it not be foolish for him to pass by the mother's door without speaking to her of him?

Billy was by his bedside, as were the doctor, the housekeeper, and the niece. The old man's eyes sought the clock. \"Eleven,\" he murmured. Then he was silent, for the town clock had begun to strike. He counted the strokes--eleven. Then he smiled and tried to speak again. \"Almost--live...", "...a tremendous task to lift the heavy car. At times they almost despaired of moving it. However, it was that very desperation that gave them strength at last. Inch by inch, slowly, carefully, they finally forced the great car upward, until with a sigh of relief they realized that the task was finished. The boys dropped to the ground, exhausted by the unusual exertion. It doesn't take very long, though, for strong, healthy boys to recover from any strain, however great; so in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> they were again in the car and ready to start for camp. It was too late to go further, and after thanking the men for their help they started back--slowly this time. It was after dark when they reached the camp, and Mr. Hollis, although confident of Bert's resourcefulness, was beginning to be slightly worried when the wanderers appeared at last upon the scene. In a very few moments the half-famished boys were seated at a most appetizing meal, to which they did full...", "...relief, and every man sprang to his feet and swarmed up on to the roof, as soon as the man on watch above told us the news; directly afterwards the major shouted, 'Each man can have a ration of water.' \"In a few minutes we saw the Arabs mount and ride off, and it was not long before five hundred of our cavalry rode into the village.

We had each night buried those who fell, and in five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after the arrival of the cavalry, were ready to start on our march back. If it had not been for that village, and for the quickness with which the major saw what was the only thing to be done, not a single man would ever have got back to camp to tell what had happened. They were brave fellows, those Arabs; and, if well drilled by our officers, would have been grand troops on such an expedition as this, and would have taught the Cossacks a good many things at their own game....", "...had trumped Mrs. Sparkes at last. Not long after this the ladies went up-stairs on their way to bed. Many of them, perhaps, did not go to their pillows at once, as it was as yet not eleven o'clock, and it was past ten when they all came down to breakfast. At any rate, Alice, who had been up at seven, did not go to bed then, nor for the next two hours. \"I'll come into your room just for one minute,\" Lady Glencora said as she passed on from the door to her own room; and in about five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she was back with her cousin. \"Would you mind going into my room--it's just there, and sitting with Ellen for a minute?\" This Lady Glencora said in the sweetest possible tone to the girl who was waiting on Alice; and then, when they were alone together, she got into a little chair by the fireside and prepared herself for conversation. \"I must keep you up for a quarter of an hour while I tell you something.

Having got fairly started the minister seemed to be in no way disposed to stop. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a chair and umbrella were brought for Lady Dufferin. At ten minutes motions were made to pluck the minister's coat tails, but no one dared. The fervid appeal covering all possible contingencies, and meandering into varied \"We give Thee thanks also\" still continued so the Governor and Lady Dufferin and their Suite quietly slipped away from the group and going to the carriages, which were waiting in readiness near by, drove away. Shortly afterwards the minister ceased and,...", "...fond of him.

He was getting accustomed to staying under the water, increasing the time of submersion a few seconds each day, and he did not doubt but he could make a record of four <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in the course of a month or two. His lung power was increasing. From Professor Rosello he had received a pack of celluloid playing cards, and Joe now added to his tricks some sleight-of-hand work with the Kings, Queens and other cards. It took well with the audience, but Joe was not satisfied. He wanted something more spectacular. Meanwhile Joe was doing less trapeze work in order to give more attention to the tank.

His going and coming was without seeing any one of the house; a fact owing to Mrs. Nettley's being away to market and Mr. Inchbald out on another errand.

The traitor shall be saved.\" He hastened to the stable, mounted his horse, and galloped away to the forest of Monfaucon. There he found Iwo standing at the gallows with the cord round his neck. Reinold knocked down one of the executioners, cut the cord round Iwo's neck, exclaiming, \"Be off, you rascal, lest you be hanged after all,\" and then...", "...\"I have something I want to say to him.

She made some apology on the part of the person whom I had come to visit, for the slight delay which had already occurred, and requested me further to wait for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> longer, intimating that the lady's grief was so violent, that without great effort she could not bring herself to speak calmly at all. As if to beguile the time, the good dame went on in a highly communicative strain to tell me, amongst much that could not interest me, a little of what I had desired to hear. I discovered that the grief of her whom I had come to visit was excited by the sudden death of a little boy, her only child, who was then lying dead in his mother's...", "...that evening does not belong to our story.

Another bite and the same result. Another, and another. In a very few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the roof was covered with his panting spoil. The broker could himself distinguish that many of them were personal friends; nay, some of them were familiar frequenters of the building on which they were now miserably stranded.

For some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> there was silence, broken only by the humming of the wind through the rigging and the liquid plop of breaking seas. But all the time the smell of oil-fuel became gradually stronger; and then, quite suddenly, the flagship--two ships ahead--switched on a searchlight. She had seen something!

Hard-wooded plants with very fine roots, like the azaleas, should have the soil rammed down firmly about the old ball; for which purpose it is necessary to use a blunt, flat piece of wood, of convenient size. In repotting such plants, it is well to let the ball of roots soak several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> in a pail of water before putting into the new pot. If very densely matted, make several holes in it with a spike, working it around, and leave the soil a little lower at the center of the pot to induce the water to run down through the root ball.

My own unfortunate temper was, no doubt, largely the cause of your brevity.\" He hesitated a moment, clearing his throat and gazing blankly at the grinning Ogden. \"As Ogden here has of course told you, I'm--well, rather touchy when interrupted at my favorite pastime, and especially so when I am trying to get a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> relaxation with a pin-headed person who insists upon playing without watching the board. \"But you spoke of wanting an opportunity of--er--entering the game professionally. I'm not admitting you're a world-beater, understand--or anything like that! You've just succeeded in putting away a man who was as formidable as the best of them, five years ago. And five years isn't today, by any means. I've been looking for a real possibility to appear for so long that I've grown...", "...began to creep up to the wind; and presently the sails showed an ominous quiver. \"Keep her full, sir!\" called John of Skye, turning round. But instead of that the sails flapped more and more; there was a rattling of blocks; two men came tumbling up from the forecastle, thinking the yacht was being put about. \"Shove your hand from ye, sir!\" called out the skipper to the distressed steersman; and this somewhat infantine direction soon put the vessel on her course again. In a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> thereafter John of Skye put his pipe in his waistcoat pocket. \"We'll let her about now, sir,\" he called to the Laird. The two men who happened to be on deck went to the jib-sheets; John himself leisurely proceeding to stand by the weather fore-sheet. Then, as the Laird seemed still to await further orders, he called out-- \"Helm hard down, sir, if ye please!\" But this rope bothered the Laird. He angrily untwisted it, let it drop on the deck, and then with both hands...", "...full.\" \"I suppose the red-skins took it, Sancho?\" \"They would not bother about a basket; it is the last thing they would think of taking. My idea is that the senorita came back here. I expect she came to warn the Indians. She would, to begin with, if she rode at full speed, have distanced the 'Paches, who would not be able to get through the herd, which must have been between them and her when she first saw them. If she were half-way down the valley she might have been here some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before them. Of course the two old Indians knew that there was no escape for them, and made no effort to avoid their fate. I expect they had only taken that pudding and medicine out of the basket when she got back. Now, seeing that the basket and all that was in it are gone, it seems to me possible enough that the senorita may have caught it up and ridden off with it, knowing that she had a long ride before her, and through a country where there are no posadas.\" \"I hope,...", "...an actor whose name was John Wilkes Booth, came into the box where Mr. Lincoln sat. No one saw him enter. He pointed a pistol at the President's head, and fired. He leaped down upon the stage, shouting \"_Sic semper tyrannis_! The South is avenged!\" Then he ran behind the scenes and out by the stage door. The President fell forward. His eyes closed. He neither saw, nor heard, nor felt anything that was taking place. Kind arms carried him to a private house not far away. At twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> past seven o'clock the next morning, those who watched beside him gave out the mournful news that Abraham Lincoln was dead. He was fifty-six years old. The whole nation wept for him. In the South as well as in the North, the people bowed themselves in grief. Heartfelt tributes of sorrow came from other lands in all parts of the world. Never, before nor since, has there been such universal mourning. Such is the story of Abraham Lincoln. In the history of the world, there...", "...him. \"You love Mr. Aldrich?\" asked a strange whisper. \"I love him,\" she said. Again several moments passed before he spoke, and when he did speak his words were to himself rather than to her. \"And this is my answer?\" \"Forgive me--because it came this way,\" she begged. There was silence between them. \"He is safe,\" he said. He continued gazing at her several moments, then without speaking again he left the room. CHAPTER IX FATHER AND DAUGHTER For several <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after Allen had gone, Helen sat, her face in her hands, waiting for the refluence of her strength. Then she walked back to the library, where she found David pacing restlessly to and fro. He saw that she was very white and that she was trembling, and forbearing to question her he led her to a deep easy-chair before the open wood fire. But she saw his suspense and at once told him that Allen would be silent. Gently, reverently, David laid his hand upon her hair, and of all...", "...too dark to see her face, for the tone expressed utter disbelief. He wanted to assure her that he meant what he said, but, reflecting that he had better not seem to suggest that she doubted it, he said-- \"That's settled, then. I suppose it will be three or four months before you get home, and I shan't have another leave for I don't know how long, so we won't fix a date. Now Mr. Daventry's bungalow is in this direction; I hope I shall be able to find it.\" They walked about for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before Smith was able to satisfy himself that he had discovered the bungalow. They passed through the compound, looked with a smile at the native servant sleeping on a mat at the door, and laughed to see him jump when awakened by Smith's vigorous rapping. At a word from Smith the man went into the dwelling, but a moment afterwards a window above the entrance was thrown open, and a loud voice demanded what was the matter. \"That you, Daventry?\" Smith called. \"Yes. Who are...", "...was to be kept absolutely quiet; the men were to know nothing about it until an hour before the time, and all the junior officers were to be kept in darkness. You know how careful the General is too.\" \"But the fact is there, man!\" cried the Colonel, \"we have the evidence of this lad, who could not possibly have been mistaken. He seemed an intelligent lad too; you saw how closely I cross-questioned him. Who is he?\" \"I will send for his sergeant,\" was the Major's reply. A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later Sergeant Ashworth appeared on the scene. It was the sergeant to whom Tom had spoken when he first came to Ypres. \"Tell me what you know of Private Pollard,\" said the Colonel. Sergeant Ashworth spoke freely about Tom. \"A smart lad, sir,\" he said, \"intelligent, and well-behaved. I spoke to him about whether he would like his lance-corporal's stripe, but he didn't seem to want it. He would make a very good non-commissioned officer, sir.\" \"He seems a lad of some...", "...to render for the much received--they all have time to waste. But let them remember, time is not their own; not a moment of it; but is the grant of Heaven; and Heaven gives nothing without a purpose and an end. Every hour that is wasted, fails of that purpose; and in so far as it is wasted or ill-spent, the gift of Heaven is misused, and the misuse is to be answered for. Methinks I would be allowed to whisper nightly in the ears of my young friends as they lie down to rest, \"How many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> have you lost to-day, that might have been employed in your own improvement, in our Maker's service, or for your fellow-creature's good?\" NOVEL-READING. Novel-reading produces a morbid appetite for excitement. The object of the novelist, generally, is to produce the highest possible degree of excitement, both of the mind and the passions. The object is very similar to that of intoxicating liquors on the body: hence, the confirmed novel-reader becomes a kind of...", "...It was, indeed, the reporter. He swung open the automobile door, and as they recognized him, they dashed across the road and gratefully slid into the shelter offered. \"Don't you girls know better than to be running around at a time like this?\" Jerry demanded severely. \"Lucky I saw you streaking up the beach!\" \"What brought you here?\" Penny gasped, taking several deep breaths. \"What brought me?

I knew you came here to do a little sleuthing, Penny, and I figured someone ought to look after you.\" \"Thanks, Jerry,\" she returned gratefully. \"We were in trouble--plenty of it.\" As the reporter drove on toward the Rhett mansion, Penny quickly revealed what had happened. Jerry made little comment, but his expression was grim. \"Maybe Anton and Celeste are here,\" he said as the car reached the Rhett...", "...(though but a very bare one) of my forcing a way through the outer ranks of the Indians and getting to a neighboring wood, which I perceived at some distance. I was still encouraged to hope by the almost miraculous preservation I had already experienced. Nor were my hopes vain or the efforts I made ineffectual. Suffice to say that I reached the wood, but by the time I had penetrated a little way into it my breath was so exhausted that I threw myself into a brake, and lay for some <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> apparently at the last gasp. At length I recovered power of respiration, but my apprehensions returned with all their former force when I saw several savages pass by, probably in pursuit of me, at no very great distance. In this situation I knew not whether it was better to proceed or endeavor to conceal myself where I lay till night came on. Fearing, however, that they would return the same way, I thought it most prudent to get farther from the dreadful scene of my past...", "...about thirty-five feet high, crumbled at once beneath the fore-foot of the leading elephant, and many tons detached from the surface quickly formed a steep incline. Squatting upon its hind-quarters, and tucking its hinder knees beneath its belly, while it supported its head upon its trunk and outstretched fore legs, it slid and scrambled to the bottom, accompanied by an avalanche of earth and dust, thus forming a good track for the following herd. It is surprising to see in how few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> a large herd of elephants descending a steep place will form a road. I have frequently seen them break down an alluvial cliff in the manner described, where at first sight I should have thought it impossible for an elephant to descend. Once within the river the fun began in earnest. After a march in the hot sun, it was delightful to bathe in the deep stream of the Brahmaputra, and the mighty forms splashed and disported themselves, sometimes totally submerged, with the drivers...", "...purpose of the enterprise was completely defeated at the outset for lack of capable leadership. It must be remembered that at that period of the war Lee's army was so far battle seasoned that any form of panic was to it completely impossible. Even when it saw the most important part of its line blown up, and thousands of Federal troops rushing into the crater, the Army of Northern Virginia remained steadfast and unshaken. Hurried orders were given, and promptly obeyed. Within ten <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> after Ledlie's column came to a halt in the crater it was forever too late for them to gain the advantage intended by rushing through that slender second line which held the Jerusalem plank road, and which alone stood then between the Federal army and Petersburg. Under Lee's command, the Army of Northern Virginia had become as perfect a piece of military mechanism as ever existed, and under Lee's command, for both Lee and Beauregard were promptly present at the post of danger,...", "...great crush and a wonderful audience in Edinburgh last night. [Sidenote: Miss Hogarth.] CARRICK'S ROYAL HOTEL, GLASGOW, _Wednesday, Dec. 16th, 1868._ This is to report all well, except that I have wretched nights.

Evidently the faint hope that Miss Walters had for the moment revived had died away again. It seemed that none of the teachers had seen anything that might arouse suspicion, and even the girls were beginning to despair when they were at last given a clue to work on. It was Miss Arbuckle who gave it to them. She showed considerable surprise at first at being questioned. But after wrinkling her forehead thoughtfully for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she remembered having seen somebody loitering about the building late on the preceding afternoon. \"Could you identify the person?\" asked Miss Walters quickly, alert at once. \"No,\" said Miss Arbuckle, hesitantly, \"I couldn't be at all certain because it was dusk and I saw him only from the window.

The fish is baked on the plank and then surrounded with a border of potatoes, the fish and potatoes making an excellent food. To prepare planked fish, thoroughly clean and bone a medium-size whitefish, shad, haddock, or any desired fish. Grease a plank and place the fish on it. Lay some strips of bacon across the top of the fish, place in a hot oven, and bake for about 30 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> or a little longer if necessary. Boil potatoes and prepare them for piping by mashing them, using 4 tablespoonfuls of milk, 1 tablespoonful of butter, and one egg to each 2 cupfuls of potato. Then, with a rosette pastry tube, pipe a border of potatoes around the edge of the plank, so that it will appear as in Fig. 22. Likewise, pipe rosettes of potatoes on the strips of bacon placed on top of the fish. Then replace the plank with the fish and potatoes in the oven, and bake...", "...He quietly announced to his officers and men his decision never to surrender, in which all concurred. They knelt together upon the deck, and the admiral made a prayer, which all fervently joined. With his own hand Klaaszoon then lighted the powder magazine, and the ship was blown into the air. Two sailors, all that were left alive, were picked out of the sea by the Spaniards and brought on board one of the vessels of the fleet. Desperately mutilated, those grim Dutchmen lived a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to tell the tale, and then died defiant on the enemy's deck. Yet it was thought that a republic, which could produce men like Regnier Klaaszoon and his comrades, could be subjected again to despotism, after a war for independence of forty years, and that such sailors could be forbidden to sail the eastern and western seas. No epigrammatic phrase has been preserved of this simple Regnier, the son of Nicholas. He only did what is sometimes talked about in phraseology more or...", "...cabbages destroyed by that scamp of a cow,\" she exclaimed in a tone bordering on despair. \"I wish I'd a hit her.

He wore his usual look, little dreaming of the storm that awaited him. \"I'm glad you've come,\" said Mrs. Mudge, grimly. \"What's amiss, now?\" inquired Mudge, for he understood her look. \"What's amiss?\" blazed Mrs. Mudge. \"I'll let you know.

Why, left to himself he seemed able to force his way to freedom, and with what aid they could extend surely only a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> would be needed to accomplish it. Even as he thought thus, he felt his hand violently thrust back. At the same moment there was the sound of heavy voices in the cabin. Evidently one or both of the tramps must have entered the second room and discovered Jerry on his knees engaged in tunneling out. There was no sound of a blow struck. Had there been, Frank could never have contained himself, but regardless of consequences must have rushed around to where the door lay, and...", "...let him in.

XXXI HIRAM AND BARBARA The cordiality of his welcome was a surprise to Mason; he could hardly tell why. The days had dragged heavily since his separation from Barbara, and his mind had been filled with doubts. The delay imposed upon him by Barbara's circumstances and then by his own was unwholesome; love long restrained from utterance is apt to make the soul sick. During his last week in Moscow he had copied court <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and other documents into the folio records in an abstracted fashion, while the conscious part of his intellect was debating his chance of securing Barbara's consent. He fancied that she might hold herself more than ever aloof from him now; that her pride had been too deeply wounded to recover, and that she would never bring herself to accept him. When he had at length finished all there was for him to do in the clerk's office at Moscow, and Magill had contrived to borrow...", "...Series, vol. v. p. 366.

Vjera entered alone. \"I have brought you the money,\" she said, joyfully, as she stood beside him and laid a hand upon his arm to attract his attention, for he had not noticed her coming. \"The money?\" he said,...", "...he asked. \"You were so long in coming,\" she replied, now with petulance. \"I guess now I don't want you at all.\" \"Ahuh! That's the reward of people who worry an' work for others. Well, then, I reckon I'll go back an' not give you what I brought.\" He made a pretense of leaving, and he put a hand to his pocket as if to insure the safety of some article. Columbine blushed. She held out her hands. She was repentant of her words and curious as to his. \"Why, Ben Wade, I count the <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> before you come,\" she said. \"What'd you bring me?\" \"Who's been in here?\" he asked, going forward. \"That's a poor fire. I'll have to fix it.\" \"Mrs. Andrews just left. It was good of her to drive up. She came in the sled, she said. Oh, Ben, it's winter. There was snow on my bed when I woke up. I think I am better to-day. Jack hasn't been in here yet!\" At this Wade laughed, and Columbine followed suit. \"Well, you look a little sassy to-day, which I take is a good sign,\"...", "...street. He did not know precisely what he intended to do, but he was quite clear that he meant to see the girl he had met in the avenue. He knew he should see her. A sense of obstacles merely braced him and was pleasurable. He went up the stone steps out of the lane to the stile that overlooked the Frobishers, the stile from which he had watched the Frobisher bedroom. There he seated himself with his arms, folded, in full view of the house. That was at ten minutes to two. At twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> to three he was still sitting there, but his hands were deep in his jacket pockets, and he was scowling and kicking his foot against the step with an impatient monotony. His needless glasses had been thrust into his waistcoat pocket--where they remained throughout the afternoon--and his cap was tilted a little back from his forehead and exposed a wisp of hair. One or two people had gone down the lane, and he had pretended not to see them, and a couple of hedge-sparrows chasing...", "...they suddenly were challenged by a French sentry. An officer, who spoke the language replied, \"France.\" \"A quel regiment?\" \"De la reine,\" the officer replied, knowing that a part of that regiment was with Bougainville. The sentry, believing that they were the expected provision boats, allowed them to pass on. A few hundred yards further, another sentry challenged them. The same officer replied in French, \"Provision boats. Don't make a noise; the English will hear us.\" A few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, the boats rowed up to the strand, at the foot of the heights. Vergor had placed no sentry on the shore, and the troops landed unchallenged. Guided by James Walsham, Colonel Howe, with his twenty-four volunteers, led the way. As silently as they could, they moved up the pathway, until they gained the top, and saw before them the outline of the tents. They went at them with a rush. Vergor leaped from his bed, and tried to run off, but was shot in the heel and captured. His...", "...egg (a pigeon's egg or a little larger). When the whole is thus prepared, drop in boiling water, boil till cooked, and use to decorate meat or fish. _Financiere._--A garniture _financiere_ is the same as a garniture with combs of chicken, to which are added some mushrooms and truffles, both cut in slices. It is generally served with a roast chicken. _With Livers._--Geese livers are the best, being the fattest. Drop two geese livers in boiling water and a little salt, boil three <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and drain. Put in a saucepan one gill of broth, same of white wine, Sauterne or Catawba, a tablespoonful of gravy, six pepper-corns, two or three stalks of parsley, salt, and the livers; set on the fire and boil gently for about twenty-five minutes. Take off the livers, boil a few minutes longer to thicken the sauce, turn it over the livers through a strainer, and it is ready. The same may be done with the livers of poultry or any other kind of birds; the seasonings are the...", "...the \"Maroons\" fell on him in a mass. Then the Blues uncovered the \"Minnesota shift\"--one of \"Bull\" Hendrick's pet tricks--and they went through the bewildered \"Maroons\" for twenty yards. Another trial of the same shift was smothered and a daring end run by Hudson of the \"Maroons\" brought the ball to the middle of the field. Four unsuccessful attempts failed to advance it and it went to the Blues on downs. The ball was now on the \"Maroons'\" forty yard line and there were only two <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> left of playing time. The \"Maroon\" defence had stiffened and it was a practical certainty that line bucking could not avail in that limited time, so Bert dropped back for a kick. Tom snapped it back to Dick, who with the same motion made a beautiful pass to Bert. With all the power of his mighty leg he swung on it and lifted it far and high. Straight as an arrow it winged its way toward the \"Maroons'\" goal. A tremendous shout had gone up as the ball left his toe, but then...", "...then to venture herself into this underground region in search of the lost child. She had made a decided conquest in the person of Tiger, who followed her round and round the tents, and when the gypsies at last began to stir, and Annie crept into the hedgerow, the dog crouched by her side. Tiger was the favorite dog of the camp, and presently one of the men called to him; he rose unwillingly, looked back with longing eyes at Annie, and trotted off, to return in the space of about five <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> with a great hunch of broken bread in his mouth. This was his breakfast, and he meant to share it with his new friend. Annie was too hungry to be fastidious, and she also knew the necessity of keeping up her strength. She crept still farther under the hedge, and the dog and girl shared the broken bread between them. Presently the tents were all astir; the gypsy children began to swarm about, the women lit fires in the open air, and the smell of very appetizing breakfasts...", "...Water Snake, and 2 or 3 evenings ago one lay under the Ship's Stern some time; this was about 1 1/2 Yards in length, and was the first we had seen. At 6 A.M. weighed with a Gentle breeze Southerly, and Steer'd North-West 1/4 West, edging in for the land until we got Within 2 Miles of it, having from 7 to 11 fathoms; we then steer'd North-North-West as the land laid. At Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 24 degrees 19 minutes South; Longitude made from Sandy Cape 1 degree 14 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> West. [At Anchor. Bustard Bay, Queensland.] Wednesday, 23rd. Continued our Course alongshore at the distance of about 2 Miles off, having from 12 to 9, 8 and 7 fathoms, until 5 o'Clock, at which time we were abreast of the South point of a Large open Bay,* (* Bustard Bay.) wherein I intended to Anchor. Accordingly we hauld in Close upon a Wind, and sent a boat ahead to sound; after making some Trips we Anchored at 8 o'Clock in 5 fathoms, a Sandy bottom. The South point of...", "...to the whistles, and the longer we stood the more it got on my nerves, her not noticing me. I suppose she'd been too much on my mind lately. I began to be put out. I scraped my feet. I coughed. By and by I said out loud: \"Look here, I guess I better get out the fog-horn and give those fellows a toot.\" \"Why?\" said she, without moving her head--calm as that. \"_Why?_\" It gave me a turn, sir. For a minute I stared at her. \"Why? Because if she don't pick up this light before very many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> she'll be too close in to wear--tide'll have her on the rocks--that's why!\" I couldn't see her face, but I could see one of her silk shoulders lift a little, like a shrug. And there I kept on staring at her, a dumb one, sure enough. I know what brought me to was hearing the Boston boat's three sharp toots as she picked up the light--mad as anything--and swung her helm a-port. I turned away from her, sweat stringing down my face, and walked around to the door. It was just as...", "...many scuppernong grapes at Pass Christian, and jolting of the heavy army wagon that makes a small stone seem the size of a boulder. One morning I was unable to walk or even stand up, and Faye and Major Bryant carried me to the wagon on a buffalo robe. All of that day's march Faye walked by the side of my wagon, and that allowed him no rest whatever, for in order to make it as easy for me as possible, my wagon had been placed at the extreme end of the long line. The troops march fifty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> and halt ten, and as we went much slower than the men marched, we would about catch up with the column at each rest, just when the bugle would be blown to fall in line again, and then on the troops and wagons would go, Faye was kept on a continuous tramp. I still think that he should have asked permission to ride on the wagon, part of the day at least, but he would not do so. One evening when the camp was near a ranch, I heard Doctor Gordon tell Faye outside the tent that I...", "...tailor shops, glove shops--anywhere under the broad sweep of the heavens that there seemed a chance of our buying anything. Anyone could have guessed that the shopkeepers paid him a percentage on the sales, but in our blessed innocence we didn't until this feature of his conduct grew unbearably prominent. One day Dan happened to mention that he thought of buying three or four silk dress patterns for presents. Ferguson's hungry eye was upon him in an instant. In the course of twenty <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> the carriage stopped. \"What's this?\" \"Zis is ze finest silk magazin in Paris--ze most celebrate.\" \"What did you come here for? We told you to take us to the palace of the Louvre.\" \"I suppose ze gentleman say he wish to buy some silk.\" \"You are not required to 'suppose' things for the party, Ferguson. We do not wish to tax your energies too much. We will bear some of the burden and heat of the day ourselves. We will endeavor to do such 'supposing' as is really...", "...miles. The outer reef extended in that direction from the south-west point of West Wallaby Island, though it could only be traced by detached patches of breakers. To the south-east of its commencement lies Evening Reef. The observations were made on the north end of the north-east Pigeon Island, bearing West by South half a mile from our anchorage, in latitude 32 degrees 27 minutes 21 seconds South and longitude 2 degrees 1 minute 10 seconds West of Swan River, variation 4 degrees 10 <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> westerly. The temperature of Houtman's Abrolhos is rendered equable by the fact that they lie at the limit of the land breezes; during the month we were there the thermometer averaged 71 degrees. Our protracted stay enabled us to get a tolerable series of tidal observations, which present some singular results. The time of high-water at the full and change was six o'clock when the tide rose 30 inches. It appeared that during the night there was a short flood of six hours...", "...sound in the ears of the traveler, if perchance he be a man fond of his tobacco. A turbulent stream cuts the town in two. On the east side stands a gloomy barn of a station; on the other side one of the most picturesque walled towns in Europe, and of Roman antiquity. The train drew in. A dozen steps more, and one was virtually in France. But there is generally a slight hitch before one takes the aforesaid steps: the French customs. A _facchino_ popped his head into the window. \"Eight <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> for examination of luggage!\" he cried. He held out his arms, and Hillard piled the luggage upon him. \"Come, Dan; lively, if we want good seats when we come out. We change trains.\" The two men followed the porter to the ticket entrance, surrendered their coupons, and passed into the customs. The porter had to go round another way. After a short skirmish they located their belongings, which unfortunately were far down toward the end of the barrier. They would have to be...", "...as you like, dear.' But Mrs. Warricombe had eaten such an excellent lunch, that Sidwell could not feel uneasy. 'We'll see how you are this evening. At all events, it will be safer for you not to go downstairs. If you lie quiet for an hour or two, I can look for those pamphlets that father wants.' 'Just as you like, dear.' By three o'clock the invalid was calmly slumbering. Having entered the bedroom on tiptoe and heard regular breathing, Sidwell went down and for a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> lingered about the hall. A servant came to her for instructions on some domestic matter; when this was dismissed she mentioned that, if anyone called, she would be found in the library. The pamphlets of which her father had spoken were soon discovered. She laid them aside, and seated herself by the fire, but without leaning back. At any sound within or outside the house she moved her head to listen. Her look was anxious, but the gleam of her eyes expressed pleasurable...", "...the room to present me to his wife and daughters. The former was a small, though more wizened, edition of her husband; the latter, however, were handsome girls of the true Spanish type. Half-a-dozen other presentations followed, after which I was at liberty to make myself as agreeable as circumstances permitted and my knowledge of the Spanish language would allow. Had only the General's daughters been present, this would not have been such a very difficult matter, for the very few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> I spent in their company were sufficient to show me that they were both past mistresses of the art of flirting. We were progressing famously, when the door opened, and the ancient man-servant who had admitted me, and who was older and even more wizened than his master or mistress, said something in a low voice to the General, who immediately hurried out of the room. A whisper ran through the company, but what its purport was I could not discover. All doubt, however, was...", "...his own and her happiness to an ungrateful people. Had he listened to her, perhaps she would have remained a good and true wife to him, and peace and happiness would have blessed his married life. Now it was all over and done with, and there without the mob was howling for his destruction. He threw the button out of the window, hastening to do away with such souvenirs. Presently from the market-square burst forth that indescribable murmur which rises from a distant crowd. The <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> seemed hours as he waited. At last a trampling of hoofs was heard; it was a lieutenant with an escort of half a dozen dragoons come to conduct Raby to the court. \"The magistrate, the notary, the councillors, are all re-elected,\" was the news they came to announce. Raby was much annoyed that they should send an armed escort for him. \"I can find the way by myself, and am not afraid of anyone,\" he said, and with that he took his documents under his arm, and set off to...", "...that his saying what he did, _as_ he did, suddenly made her see things in a different light, herself. That's why she got up soon after, and said that they must be going. She wanted a chance to tell Watson she'd changed her mind, and that he was right in whatever matter it was they'd been arguing about. But before they went, George Woodson started a new song that's lately come to town. They say all the soldiers are singing it. It has a catchy sort of tune you can't resist, and in a few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> we were all chiming in with him. It sounded awfully sweet, for George sings a lovely tenor and Richard a good bass, so we had a full quartette. It was just like old times. \"There's a long, long trail a-winding Into the land of my dreams, Where the nightingales are singing And a white moon beams. There's a long, long night of waiting Until my dreams all come true, Till the day--when I'll be--going down That long, long trail with...", "...to take a walk.\" \"No matter; ask him, or I will go immediately.\" Walter made no objection to going, and the three young people left the bow-windowed room. Thea looked after them with entreaty in her eyes, as though to detain them, but they paid her no heed, and she turned again to her work with a resigned face, resolved to endure in silence the further unavoidable _tete-a-tete_ with her mother-in-law. It was not destined, however, to last long on this occasion, for in a very few <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> Herr von Rosen's light wagon drove up; he had come for his daughter Alma. Thea hastened to meet him, and brought him in triumph into the room, which was instantly illumined as by sunlight by the old man's genial smile, the brightness of which called forth a pale reflection even on the old Countess's sad face. No human being could remain unresponsive to Herr von Rosen's cordiality. It was so easy to see that his kindliness was not the result of conventional habit, but was due to...", "...Only punish me--punish me--and then--let me--go!\" Voice and strength failed together. Her limbs doubled under her, and she sank suddenly down at his feet, sobbing--terrible, painful, tearless sobs that seemed to rend her very being. Without a word he stooped and lifted her. He was white to the lips, but there was no hesitancy about him. He acted instantly and decidedly as a man quite sure of himself. He carried her to the old _charpoy_ by the window and laid her down. Many <span class=\"clocktext\">minutes</span> later, when her anguish had a little spent itself, she realised that he was kneeling beside her, holding her pressed against his heart. Through all the bitter chaos of her misery and her shame there came to her the touch of his hand upon her head. It amazed her--it thrilled her, that touch of his; in a fashion it awed her. She kept her face hidden from him; she could not look up. But he did not seek to see her face. He only kept his hand upon her throbbing temple till she..."]
