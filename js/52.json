The public was not slow in showing its appreciation of 'pabulum' put before it, and, so its directors averred, in less than two years the circulation rose from five to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> thousand copies. A great deal of this success was due to Poe's weird and wonderful stories; still more, perhaps, to his trenchant critiques and his startling theories anent cryptology. As regards the tales now issued in 'Graham's', attention may especially be drawn to the world-famed \"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" the first of a series--'\"une espece de trilogie,\"' as Baudelaire styles them--illustrative of an analytic phase of Poe's peculiar mind.

Soon after this time, we find, the organization had spread to the United States, Canada, Australia, France, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, Scandinavia, Germany and Italy. Then missionary work was taken up in India, and later on, in Africa, Java and Japan.

The library also possessed a large number of the early editions of Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, and other Italian Classics; and no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> Caxtons, three of them unique, were to be found on its shelves. A splendid descriptive catalogue of the library, entitled 'Bibliotheca Spenceriana,' was compiled by Dibdin in the years 1814-23.

After crossing, the command took the road leading down through the river bottom lands for five miles, when it reached the foot of the Sequatchie Mountain.

Indeed he eventually wrote an article for one of the magazines in which he maintained: \"There are one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> distinctly different ways of holding a baby--and all are right!

I might then have fixed the lessened price at twenty-eight shillings, and at the present time I have a greater expectation of a reduction in the price of wheat in Mark Lane to less than twenty-eight shillings a quarter, or eighty-five cents a bushel, than I had in 1880 that it would so soon reach thirty-four shillings.

When he assumed control of the Treasury he found, as nearly as could be calculated, ten millions of foreign debt with about two millions of accrued interest, and twenty-nine millions of domestic debt with eleven millions of accrued interest,--a total of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> millions. So far as there was any sale for United States securities they had fallen to about twenty-five per cent of their par value. Jan. 14, 1790, Hamilton submitted one of a series of elaborate financial reports; it called on Congress to make such provision for principal and interest as would restore confidence.

The next question to which he directed his experiments, was to ascertain the quantity of cold water necessary to be injected into the cylinder, in order to condense the steam contained in it. To ascertain this, he attached a pipe to a boiler, by which he was enabled to conduct the steam from the boiler into a glass jar containing cold water at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> degrees of temperature. The steam, as it passed from the boiler through the pipe, was condensed by the cold water, and continued to be so condensed, until, by the heat which it imparted to the water, the latter began to boil, and would then condense no more steam.

I travelled, as straight as the bush would allow, towards the junction; Graham examining the channel while we proceeded. No water was found where the rivers united. Having halted the small party with...", "...and by the stately mansions of Orange, Egmont, Aremberg, Culemburg, and other Flemish grandees, on the right.. The great forest of Soignies, dotted with monasteries and convents, swarming with every variety of game, whither the citizens made their summer pilgrimages, and where the nobles chased the wild boar and the stag, extended to within a quarter of a mile of the city walls. The population, as thrifty, as intelligent, as prosperous as that of any city in Europe, was divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> guilds of artisans, among which the most important were the armorers, whose suits of mail would turn a musket-ball; the gardeners, upon whose gentler creations incredible sums were annually lavished; and the tapestry-workers, whose gorgeous fabrics were the wonder of the world. Seven principal churches, of which the most striking was that of St. Gudule, with its twin towers, its charming facade, and its magnificently painted windows, adorned the upper part of the city. The...", "...AND LLANTHONY.

Here rises, just north of the town, the Sugar Loaf, one thousand eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> feet high, and on the left hand the mass of old red sandstone known as the Blorenge, one thousand seven hundred and twenty feet high. A few miles up the tributary vale of Ewias, which discloses glorious scenery, are the ruins of Llanthony Priory. The valley is a deep winding glen cut out by the Hodeni between the great cliffs of the Black Mountains on the one side and the ranges around the Sugar Loaf on the other. In places the cliffs are precipitous, but, generally, the...", "...cheek, your opportunity begins.\" Cowper's mother must have well used this opportunity considering the impression her brief companionship made upon the poet. She died when he was six years old, and yet in after-life he could say that not a week passed in which he did not think of her. When his cousin one day presented him with a portrait of his mother he said: \"I had rather possess that picture than the richest jewel in the British crown; for I loved her with an affection that her death, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years since, has not in the least abated.\" Surely it is better for a mother to merit such love than to leave the care of her children almost entirely to servants because all her time is occupied \"serving divers lusts and pleasures.\" \"Give your child to be educated by a slave,\" said an ancient Greek, \"and instead of one slave, you will then have two.\" On the other hand, \"happy is he whom his mother teacheth.\" One good mother is worth a hundred nurses or teachers.

Complaints and testimonies came pouring in, and in four days the officer had the names of hundreds of witnesses, establishing no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> crimes of the most serious nature. Fewzi's friends and relatives, in the mean while, were doing their utmost to stem the tide of accusations.

It is worthy of notice that the Bible, which is alleged by the priests to be God's word revealed to the people, was never revealed to the people of England in their own tongue until the fourteenth century; that it was not until <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years after printing had been introduced into England that any attempt was made to print an English edition: and that the first man who was sufficiently religiously disposed to print an edition, had his work burnt by the very men who, if their doctrines are true, should have zealously guarded each copy. Not only were the Bibles burnt, but every person in whose possession they were found was subjected to severe punishment. Despite all this, the editions issued by Tyndale were...", "...crushed and lost amid floating ice, though the crew were saved. The others were in great danger.

He had nearly reached his destination when three sail did heave in sight, which he took to be the missing vessels. He was soon undeceived. They were armed English merchantmen--the _Hampshire_, of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> guns; the _Daring_, of thirty-six; and the _Hudson's Bay_, of thirty-two. The chances looked bad for the _Pelican_, which had but forty-four; but Iberville was accustomed to taking chances, and he did not decline the unequal fight.

A history of the rooms up to the time of their use as a theatre may be briefly sketched. In 1548 the buttery and frater, with certain other buildings, were let by King Edward to Sir Thomas Cawarden, Master of the Revels; and in 1550 they were granted to him outright. In 1554 Cawarden sold the northern section of the buttery, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> feet in length, to Lord Cobham, whose mansion it adjoined. The rest of the buttery, forty-six feet in length, and the frater, he converted into lodgings. Since the frater was of exceptional breadth--fifty-two feet on the outside, forty-six feet on the inside--he ran a partition through its length, dividing it into two parts. The section of the frater on the west of this partition he let to Sir Richard Frith; the section on the east, with the remainder of the buttery not sold...", "...he was a prince--in order to assume the humble garb and subject himself to the obedience of the Society of Jesus.

To Milton's poetry he has given forty-one paragraphs, and to his character <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> paragraphs. The most common way of emphasizing important divisions of an essay is by increasing the length of treatment. Emphasis of Emotion. However, there are times when this cannot be done: a point may be so well known that it needs no amplification. In such a case there may be an emphasis of emotion; that is, the statement may be made with an intensity that counterbalances the weight of the larger treatment. It might be said that the one has great velocity and...", "...hands of Mr. Thomas Hay Marshall, also a reporter, who came to be known as the \"historian of Perth.\" Before the end of the year, however, this periodical may be said to have entered upon another stage of its existence, with an alteration of the title to \"The Perth and Dundee Saturday Journal,\" and in an eight-page issue.

After this we fell to work at business. By dint of abundant wrangling and with an immense display of suspicion, natural under the circumstances, it was arranged that the king should forward me in a couple of his own canoes to Banza Nokki, the end of river navigation, as we were told, and falsely told; in my turn I was to pay goods valued about L6, at least three times the usual tariff.

The time of this earthquake, which is simply mentioned by Zechariah (14:5) as occurring in Uzziah's reign, cannot be determined. We only know that Amos must have prophesied somewhere during the last part of the reign of Jeroboam II., when he was contemporary with Uzziah. Amos was thus contemporary with Hosea, and was a considerable number of years earlier than Isaiah, who began to prophesy near the close of Uzziah's long reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years. The very specific date \"two years before the earthquake\" indicates that his whole mission to Israel was executed within a single year, perhaps within a few months. It seems to have been after his return to Judah, when at least two years had elapsed, that he collected his prophecies and put them into their present form.

Ninety years ago the game of Commerce was recognised as being played in two distinct ways, the new and the old mode, so that it may justly be termed one of the oldest round games now practised. Although it is not so popular as some of the others treated of in this volume, it will be found to be a good game; exciting, entertaining, and well deserving of more extended popularity than it has lately enjoyed. Commerce is usually played with the full pack of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> cards, but if the number of players does not exceed seven the smaller pack of thirty-two may be used, the game being available for any number of players within the range of the pack, say seven with the thirty-two cards, and twelve with the fifty-two. The cards count in the usual way, except that in reckoning the number of pips upon them, which is sometimes necessary in the course of play, the ace counts for eleven, and the court cards for ten each.

The hopes of those who expected to return home were destined to be disappointed. We were still at sea, keeping a look-out for the fleet of the royal corsairs, when a shout from the mast-head announced the approach of several ships from the northward, and as they got nearer the white flag with the red-cross flying from their peaks told us that they were friends. The leading ship proved to be the _Fairfax_, of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> guns and two hundred and fifty men, carrying the flag of Vice-Admiral Penn. Following her came the _Centurion_, Captain Lawson, the _Adventure_, Captain Ball, and two others commanded by Captains Howett and Jordan, with the _Assurance_, Captain Benjamin Blake, the younger brother of the admiral. Directly afterwards Vice-Admiral Hall with another squadron of seven ships joined us. The admiral had now under him a fleet capable of coping with that of either France or Spain....", "...of 405.

An immense quantity of military stores was also taken; one hundred and twenty catapultae of the larger size, two hundred and eighty-one of the smaller; twenty-three ballistae of the larger size, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> of the smaller; an immense number of scorpions of the larger and smaller size, and also of arms and missile weapons; and seventy-four military standards. Of gold and silver, an immense quantity was brought to the general; there were two hundred and seventy-six golden bowls, almost all of them weighing a pound; of silver, wrought and coined, eighteen thousand three hundred pounds' weight; and of silver vessels an immense number. All these were weighed and reckoned to the...", "...visions in the dark, but all his phantasms appeared in broad daylight, or at night when candles had been brought in or a large fire was burning in the fireplace.

Captain Bell commenced the work; but abandoned it after a little while. A few weeks later a white-haired old man appeared to him at night, pulling his ear and saying: \"What! will you not take time to translate the book? I will give you soon a place for it and the necessary leisure.\" Bell was much startled; but nevertheless neglected the work. A fortnight after the vision he was arrested and lodged in the gate-house of Westminster, where he remained for ten years, of...", "...was but a few pounds--5 or 7--in excess of that of the atmosphere.

He went to England when <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years of age, to introduce his inventions. Perkins's experimental apparatus consisted of a copper boiler, of a capacity of about one cubic foot, having sides 3 inches in thickness. It was closed at the bottom and top, and had five small pipes leading from the upper head. This was placed in a furnace kept at a high temperature by a forced combustion. Safety-valves loaded respectively to 425 and 550 pounds per square inch were placed on each of two of the steam-pipes....", "...but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 6:13 For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. 6:14 Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. 6:15 So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> days. 6:16 It happened, when all our enemies heard of it, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God. 6:17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them. 6:18 For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of...", "...could scarcely hobble.

They lay dead and stark frozen in every conceivable and revolting attitude, as death had overtaken them in their agony.

When we reached Wheeler's ford, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> miles from Saltville, I had left, of my three hundred, only fifty men. Here we had our last skirmish with the enemy, and gave up the pursuit. More than one hundred prisoners were taken, many of them unable to walk.

The raid had accomplished great things, but at terrible cost. Soon after this, my brigade went into winter quarters. Forage...", "...performed evolutions within on horseback. The late Little-plume is credited with having introduced the present custom of reciting deeds, requiring horses, outside the dancing lodge. It may be of interest to note that the Arapaho also made very large sun dance shelters. In 1908 Mr. Duvall measured the dancing lodge. The sun pole stood sixteen feet from the ground to the fork. The posts were eight feet and approximately sixteen feet apart. The diameter of the whole was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> feet. The fireplace was east of the sun pole six feet and was four feet by two feet and five inches deep. The booth for medicinemen was five feet eight inches wide by seven feet six inches deep. The two holes were about a foot forward from the sod walls, eight inches across and six inches deep.

The slaves were judged by the Masters.

Of course, I am aware, that certain changes have been made by Government (since the publication of the above book) as to the amount of individual incomes, but the _aggregate_ sum is still absorbed by the Protestant Church, as by Law established.

Louis XIV was enamored of Madame de Montespan. She had once smiled upon Frontenac; and it is said that the jealous King gladly embraced the opportunity of removing from his presence and from hers a lover who had forestalled him. Frontenac's wife had no thought of following him across the sea, a more congenial life awaiting her at home.... Frontenac was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years old when he landed at Quebec. If time had done little to cure his many faults, it had done nothing to weaken the springs of his unconquerable vitality. In his ripe middle age he was as keen, fiery, and perversely headstrong as when he quarreled with Prefontaine in the hall at St. Fargeau. Had nature disposed him to melancholy, there was much in his position to awaken it. A man of courts and camps, born and bred in the focus of a most gorgeous civilization, he was...", "...As the last day of the cycle drew to a close, the priests formed a procession, and set out for a mountain about six miles from Mexico. There an altar was built. At midnight a captive, the bravest and finest of their prisoners, was laid on it. A piece of wood was laid on his breast, and on this fire was built by twirling a stick. As soon as fire was produced, the prisoner was killed as a sacrifice. The production of new fire was proof that the gods had granted them a new period of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years. To understand how the years in this cycle were arranged and numbered, we must refer once more to the Mayas, for though they did not use the cycle themselves, yet they give us a hint as to how it was obtained, and afford one more reason why we should think the Mayas were the originators of this calendar system. We give a table showing the arrangement of the days of the year among the Mayas. We will take the year Kan--that is, we remember, when Kan was the first day of...", "...these birds of paradise. \"Five voyages to different parts of the district they inhabit, each occupying in its preparation and execution the larger part of a year, produced me only five species out of the fourteen known to exist in the New-Guinea district.\" If it took Wallace, with all the assistance that he had from various officials, five years to obtain five species, represented by dead birds, how long did it take Noah's agents to obtain eighteen species represented by two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> live birds? Wallace could only obtain two alive, and for these he had to pay five hundred dollars. If the antediluvian sinners were any thing like the modern ones, Noah must have been richer than the Rothschilds, or he never could have obtained their services; which he must have done, or it could never be truthfully said, \"according to all that God commanded him, so did he.\" The collection of the land-snails alone would be no small tax.

This crowning disaster paralysed all effort. Only by degrees, and unaided, did the waters subside. The unfortunate inhabitants had lost all; many lost their lives; the port of Romney was crippled. Tradition even goes so far as to tell how <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> thousand persons were drowned in a tidal wave. Worst of all, the great monastery of Christ Church, ruled at that time by men more grasping than enterprising, expended nothing to make those misfortunes lighter. The port and harbour of New Romney, in especial, brought into flourishing existence by the statesmanlike policy of the early churchmen, was ruined by the later, who at this hour of need treated it merely as a source of revenue, and refused to undertake those works...", "...words from one of the speakers: \"I am a member of the church myself, and bear an honorable name therein; but I am unwilling to be classed with a set of bigots who would rob us of our personal liberties and, if possible, place all kinds of restrictive measures about our inalienable rights.

I felt safe myself--nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours. So this is what I did. From our various works I selected all the men--boys I mean--whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure I could swear to, and I called them together secretly and gave them their instructions. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> of them; none younger than fourteen, and none above seventeen years old.\" \"Why did you select boys?\" \"Because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition and reared in it.

The first vessel was sighted on the larboard bow, and, as the frigate overhauled her, proved to be a full-rigged ship. Soon after a second sail, also a ship, was sighted; and a few minutes more sufficed to show that both were men-of-war. The one first sighted was the frigate-built corvette \"Cyane,\" of thirty-four guns; and the second was the sloop-of-war \"Levant,\" of twenty-one guns. For either of these vessels singly, the \"Constitution,\" with her <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> guns and crew of four hundred and fifty men, was more than a match. Yet to attack the two was a bold movement, and this Stewart determined to undertake. Hardly had the character of the strangers been made out, when the corvette was seen making signals to the sloop; and the two vessels, then about ten miles apart, made all sail to get together before the enemy should overhaul them. This juncture was precisely what Stewart wished to prevent; and in a trice the shrill notes of...", "...to my house to prepare a feast. {65} I will find you in everything.

They moored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house of King Alcinous.

She was a great friend of the Princess Belgiojoso, and during the stirring times of 1848 the Princess had been a frequent visitor in her salon. Six years younger than the Princess, the Countess threw herself heart and soul into the political and literary life of Milan. \"For <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> consecutive years (1834-1886) her salon was the rendezvous not merely of her compatriots but of intellectual Europe.

The railways, it might be added, would still have a large and increasing package-freight business, besides the handling of heavy freight in parts of the country where there are no navigable rivers. For these reasons it would seem clearly the only wise policy to adopt a general plan for waterway improvement and carry it into effect at once. But there are many things to be considered. Millions of dollars (in all about five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> millions) have been spent for the improvement of waterways. Some of it has resulted in great gain, but a large part of it has been wasted through lack of an organized plan. Work has been begun and not enough money appropriated to finish it. In the course of a few years much of the value of the work is destroyed by the action of the current or by shifting sands, or if a stretch of river is finished in the most approved manner, often it is not used much, in some cases actually...", "...with much delicacy and finish.

These formulae were translated and adapted by the Rev. S.

I will consider it here somewhat more in detail. The menopause, also called the climacteric, and in common language \"change of life,\" is the period at which woman ceases to menstruate. The average age at which this occurs is about forty-eight. But while some women continue to menstruate up to the age of fifty, fifty-two, and even fifty-five, others cease to menstruate at the age of forty-five or even forty-two. Between forty-four and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> are the normal limits. Anything before or beyond that is exceptional. Just as the beginning of menstruation may set in without any trouble of any kind, and just as some women have not the slightest unpleasant symptoms during the entire period of their menstrual life, so the menopause occurs in some women without any trouble, physical or psychic. The periods between the menses become perhaps a little longer, or a little irregular, the menstrual flow becomes more and more...", "...a fair prospect of old age.

Berkhampstead (Beorhhamstede, Berchehamstede) was undoubtedly of some importance in Saxon times since there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> burgesses there at the time of the Conquest. In 1156 Henry II. granted the men and merchants of the town the same laws and customs as they had in the time of Edward the Confessor, and that they should be quit of toll throughout England, Normandy, Aquitaine and Anjou. Berkhampstead rose to importance with its castle, which is said to have been built by Robert, count of Mortain, and when the castle fell into ruin after 1496 the town also began to decay.

There is something curious about the average man's conception of distance. During the entire trip we found no two men who agreed on this general subject.

The conversation very often proceeded in this manner: \"Will you please tell us how far it is to So-and-So?\" \"One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> and a half miles!\" (with an air of absolute certainty). \"But you are slightly mistaken, sir; the exact distance is sixty-two and seven-tenths miles!\" (Consternation on the face of the omniscient informant.)

Added to what they had made previously, the doctor and the captain now held a matter of nine thousand dollars' worth of gold between them. Not a fortune, but still a tidy sum, all things considered. The Portneys, of course, had fared much better. The total yield of gold to them from start to finish footed up to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> thousand dollars. Of this amount, as we know, one-half went to Earl and Randy, which gave the lads exactly thirteen thousand dollars apiece. Twenty-six thousand dollars was Foster Portney's share, but out of this he had been compelled to spend three thousand dollars in bringing the party up and keeping them, and he would have to spend nearly another thousand in getting them home.

There really is something wonderful in this since of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> weeks constituting a year, the sow would be carrying her pigs some forty-eight weeks. This would allow only four weeks for the two litters of pigs to be suckled, and this would also include the few days between the pigs being weaned and the sow coming in heat.

In _Cadenus and Vanessa_ he insists upon his declining years with an emphasis which seems excessive even from a man of forty-four (in 1713 he was really forty-five) to a girl of twenty. In a singular poem called the _Progress of Marriage_ he treats the supposed case of a divine of fifty-two marrying a lively girl of fashion, and speaks with his usual plainness of the probable consequences of such folly. We cannot doubt that here as elsewhere he is thinking of himself. He was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> when receiving the passionate love-letters of Vanessa; and the poem seems to be specially significant. This is one of those cases in which we feel that even biographers are not omniscient; and I must leave it to my readers to choose their own theory, only suggesting that readers too are fallible.

In the year 1196 Longbeard originated the practice of forming political associations, and got together no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> thousand members, who swore to stand by him as the advocate and saviour of the poor; an oath which ended in heir literally standing by him and seeing him savagely butchered by his enemies.

Further payments of the public debt would have been made, in anticipation of the period of its reimbursement under the authority conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury, by the acts of July twenty-first, 1841, and of April fifteenth, and of March third, 1843, had not the unsettled state of our relations with Mexico menaced hostile collision with that power. In view of such a contingency, it was deemed prudent to retain in...", "...as could be expected in a beleaguered town, out of whose harbour a winter gale had been for many weeks blowing and preventing all ingress.

After that the number annually diminished rapidly, and for several years past not one raven had been killed.

Mr Grattan estimates it at twenty-five thousand men, and _thirteen thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven guitars_. Of these latter, he tells us twelve thousand seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> were in cases, and the remainder without; Indeed he is so exceedingly circumstantial that we presume he counted them himself.

The Committee of this Society were very anxious to reproduce these extremely quaint memorials of a by-gone age, but on enquiry it was found that the cost of re-engraving the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> cards on copper, the only really satisfactory method, would be far beyond the means of a Society then barely numbering 120 members. Being Honorary Secretary both the Aungervyle and Clarendon Historical Societies, I suggested that the work should be undertaken at the joint expense of the two Societies. This was rather outside the plans of the Clarendon, but the Committee at length agreed to provide a portion of the necessary funds on condition that after the fifty-two cards...", "...I could stand it no longer, I piped out, 'Cousin Dorothy, please can I have my waffles now?' Of course, my mother was dreadfully mortified, for some of the guests were strangers, and very great people; but Dorothy took it as a mighty good joke, and even after I was married she used to laugh about my 'w'awful' disappointment.

The fierce fighting Border clans had practically broken with institutional religion in all its forms. It is frequently said of them, and not without good reason, that they feared neither God nor man. They delighted in robbing and burning churches, and held both priest and presbyter in high disdain. Johnie Armstrong of Gilnockie is credited with having destroyed, during the course of his career, no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> parish churches. The picture of the religious condition of the Borders, as reflected in the State Papers, is well fitted to awaken painful reflections. Eure, for example, in a letter addressed to Queen Elizabeth, in the year 1596, says:--\"Another most grievous decay is the 'want of knowledge of God,' whereby the better sort forget oath and duty, let malefactors go without evidence, and favour a partie belonging to them or their friends.

With or without inspiration, he believes that hard work is necessary, and that good workmanship ought to be rated more highly.

In his latest volume, _Retrogression_, published in 1917, thirty-two of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> poems are devoted to the defence of standards of poetic art and of purity of speech. They are all interesting and contain some truth; but if the \"new\" poetry and the \"new\" criticism are really balderdash, they should not require so much attention from one of the most eminent of contemporary writers. I think Mr. Watson is rather stiff-necked and obstinate, like an honest, hearty country squire, in his sturdy following of tradition.

They accepted it, and prepared the work at their rooms, and gave out one hundred and twenty-eight thousand articles to be made, paying out over six thousand dollars for labor. Several other contracts followed, particularly one for two hundred and sixty-one thousand yards of bandages, for the rolling of which six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> dollars were paid. By these means and a judicious liberality, the Society prevented a great amount of suffering in the families of soldiers.

The Constellation immediately set her ensign and gave chase, but La Vengeance, having on board a large number of officers of rank and soldiers which she was carrying to France, would rather not have fought, and so took to her heels. The chase continued from the morning of the 1st of February until late in the afternoon of the 2d, and it was eight o'clock at night before they finally came to close quarters.

The industrial nations, desiring food, raw materials, markets and a field for investment, being thwarted by conditions in certain backward agricultural countries, seek to remedy these conditions by means of political sovereignty. It is not necessary to control well-governed countries which are peopled by economically ambitious men who will work six {86} days a week, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> weeks in a year. In politically independent countries, however, and especially in the tropics, production is rendered ineffective by the disturbed political conditions, the lack of capital and capitalistic intelligence, the absence of fixed industrial habits, as well as by a general inertia and distaste for continuous labour under the hot sun. As a result, industrial nations are deprived of the markets and food supplies, which they consider necessary to their...", "...Jules Second, Pie Fifth, Hildebrand; he would have sold all just the same!...

An attempt to compromise the dispute by omitting the words pronouncing the throne vacant, and inserting words which merely proclaimed the Prince and Princess of Orange King and Queen, was rejected by <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> votes to forty-seven[9]; and the original clause was then put and negatived by fifty-five votes to forty-one. Thus amended by the substitution of \"deserted\" for \"abdicated,\" and the omission of the words \"and that the throne is thereby vacant,\" the resolution was sent back to the Commons, who instantly and without a division disagreed with the amendments.

The ball made a terrific row rushing over us. Whilst we were marching down to the attack the fire on both sides was at its height.

To tell this story we must be forgiven for forsaking strict chronology; for the incident here narrated took place while part of the corps was still engaged at the siege of Mooltan.

Its armament consisted of no less than eighteen guns, while <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> lay stored in reserve, and its garrison consisted of such veteran fighters as a regiment of Sikh infantry. As may readily be understood, without touching on strategical details, it was a matter of considerable importance that this fort, lying as it did on the main line of the British communications between Umballa and Lahore, should not remain in hostile hands. It was therefore resolved to send back from Lahore a force to capture if possible, but at any rate to mask, this...", "...to first spill a little on the edge of the hearth.

On the last day of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years, after the sun had set, all the priests clothed themselves with the dress and insignia of their gods, so as to themselves appear like very gods, and set out in procession for the mountain, walking very slowly, with much gravity and silence, as befitted the occasion and the garb they wore, \"walking,\" as they phrased it, \"like gods.\" The priest of the ward of Copolco, whose office it was to produce the fire, carried the instruments thereof in his hand, trying them from...", "...and repulsion, forces of, ii. 303 _sqq._ Augustine, i. 88 Augustus celebrates games at Actium, i. 80 Australia, totemism in, ii. 311 ---- Northern, ii. 145 Australian aborigines, i. 126, 307 _sq._; their mutilations of the dead, ii. 272 Australians, the Central, ii. 165 Austria, harvest customs in, i. 276, 292 Awe, Loch, i. 142 Awemba, the, i. 115; of Northern Rhodesia, ii. 272 _sq._ Ayrshire, harvest customs in, i. 279 Aztecs, their festival at end of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years, i. 310 _sq._; eating the god among the, ii. 86 _sqq._ Baba or Boba, name given to last sheaf, i. 144 _sq._; \"the Old Woman,\" at the Carnival, ii. 332, 333 Bacchanals of Thrace, i. 17 Badagas, the, ii. 55 Baden, harvest customs in, i. 283, 286, 292, 298 Baganda, the, i. 118, ii. 64, 70 _n._ 1, 227, 253, 271 _sq._; their offerings of first-fruits, 113; their fear of the ghosts of animals, 231 _sq._ Bagobos, the, ii. 124; of Mindanao, i. 240...", "...nothing.\" I hastened to add, \"But they are in all the ladies' rooms too.\" \"What! in the Chinese ladies' too?\" \"Yes!\" I persisted. \"Oh, well, well!\" We resigned ourselves to the ways of the country.

Spurzheim's location, much farther back, is somewhat less erroneous, but both are thoroughly false, and a few months of my first observations <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years ago satisfied me as to this error. That it should have flourished unchallenged by Phrenologists for eighty years, seems to show that when a dominant idea is once established in the mind, all facts are made to conform to it.

The game of Poker is played with an ordinary pack of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> cards. The number of players is limited only by the number of cards, but in practice it is found better to limit each table to five, or at most six, players. The cards have the same values as at Whist, _i.e._ ace is the highest in each suit; then follow king, queen, knave, ten, etc., down to two. In \"sequences,\" however, the ace is the lowest card, and the king the highest. The suit of hearts, _ceteris paribus_, takes precedence of other suits.

The Arthemise was a fine sailing frigate, of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> guns, with huge spars--one of the most elegant types of the old-fashioned ships, but an old-fashioned ship she was indeed. We even had hempen cables instead of chain ones! The crew, drawn almost exclusively from the lists of registered seamen, was active and bold on the rigging, but somewhat insubordinate. The words of command were given amidst volleys of oaths, and carried out under a hail of blows dealt by the petty officers. The superior officers, who had all belonged to...", "...from the king's private library to the British Museum, where it is now preserved.

From the days of the Restoration no letters were more eagerly sought and prized than those of the queen. Royalist society regarded her as an august, heroic, and innocent victim, and attributed the ruin of the monarchy to the neglect of her high-minded counsels. It became a lucrative occupation to steal letters that bore her signature, in order to sell them to wealthy purchasers. Prices rose steadily. A letter of the year 1784, which fetched <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> francs in 1850, was sold for one hundred and seven in 1857, and for one hundred and fifty in 1861. In 1844 one was bought for two hundred francs, and another for three hundred and thirty. A letter to the Princess de Lamballe, which fetched seven hundred francs in 1860, went up to seven hundred and sixty in 1865, when suspicion was beginning to stir. In all, forty-one letters from the queen to Mme. de Lamballe have been in the market, and not one of them was genuine. When it...", "...a pity it was; then to wonder whether she deserved it all; next, to believe that she had done no harm; lastly, to feel that I had been a brute. Thereupon I rushed to coax and kiss her, wiped away her tears with my own lawn handkerchief--the feel of which consoled her, for the edge was lace--and begged her pardon fifty times in a thousand foolish words. Finally she was quite set up again by this: \"I tell you, my dear Patty, when I come to your age, when I am five and thirty\"--she was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> at least--\"I shall fully deserve to be called an old woman for this; and much older I shall look, there is no doubt, than you do.\" \"Right, my good friend, you are quite right there\"--this expression showed me that she herself was right.--\"Why the young man from the butcher's, he said to me this morning, and beautiful black hair reminded me of yours, Miss, all stuck together with the fat from off the kidneys--\" \"Come, Mrs. Shelfer, let me see about my box.\" \"To be...", "...hieroglyphic signs, which were followed up and carried out by Champollion. Another important and much more ancient inscription is the tablet of Abydos in the British Museum. It was discovered by Mr. Banks in a chamber of the temple of Abydos, in 1818.

The tablet is of fine limestone, and originally contained the names of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> Kings disposed in the two upper lines, twenty-six in each line, and a third or lower line with the name and praenomen of Remeses II. or III. repeated twenty-six times. On the upper line, beginning from the right hand, are the names of monarchs anterior to the twelfth dynasty. The names in the second line are those of monarchs of the twelfth and the eighteenth or nineteenth dynasties. The King Remeses II. probably stood on the right hand of the tablet, and on the other is the...", "...claims in his own right and that of his wife, which he is to hold in fee simple by patent from the President, with full power and authority to sell and dispose of the same, to-wit.

He went from town to town, stirring up the sluggish conscience of French Protestantism. He terminated his arduous toils in 1858, leaving behind him a French branch of the Methodist church, which embraces one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> houses of worship, one hundred ministers, lay and clerical, and fifteen hundred members. Merle d'Aubigne has said of Dr. Cook that \"the work which John Wesley did in Great Britain Charles Cook has done, though on a smaller scale, on the Continent.\" His death was lamented by all the leaders of French Protestantism. Professor G. De Felice, of Montauban, has affirmed that, of the instruments of the French awakening, \"Dr. Charles Cook was not the least influential.\"[99] The...", "...that's all.

St. Liguori was canonized by Gregory XVI. in 1839. Pius IX. canonized <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> and beatified twenty-six of the martyrs of Japan. The Franciscans had sought from Urban VIII. in 1627 canonization for six missionaries and seventeen Japanese converts martyred in 1596 (\u00a7 150, 2), but were refused because they would not pay 52,000 Roman thalers for the privilege. Pius IX. granted this, and included three Jesuit missionaries. At Pentecost, 1862, the celebration took place, amid acclamations, firing of cannons, and ringing of bells. In 1868 the infamous...", "...and a four-track electric road leading to Los Angeles, now a city of three hundred thousand inhabitants. Trains on this road go at the rate of sixty miles an hour. The picturesqueness, the Aladdin lamp character of the change, would not perhaps be heightened, but certainly the contrast is greater, if the days of 1835 be compared with 1911 instead of 1859, while the startling growth from 1859 to the present makes one pause to ask what will be the progress and the changes in the next <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years.

It was natural to feel a little dismayed at the prospect of so great a change; but now, after three years of renewed experience of England, I find how incomparably superior is civilised life, where feelings, tastes, and intellect find abundant nourishment, to the spiritual sterility of half-savage existence, even though it be passed in the garden of Eden.

This variety is most noticeable when we examine a large number of manors one by one, since, when the figures of many different manors are added together, their distinctive features are liable to be concealed in the aggregate.

Vishnu, for instance, is thus alluded to:-- Another with his mighty stride has made three steps To where the gods rejoice in bliss. A far more difficult collection, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> stanzas, occurs in the first book (164). Nothing here is directly described, the language being always symbolical and mystical. The allusions in several cases are so obscurely expressed that it is now impossible to divine the meaning.

Occasionally the poet propounds a riddle of which he himself evidently does not know the solution.

For instance, in Leroux's house, where there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> pupils, there were only four who had got their caps. Though one of the youngest boys in the house Leroux threw himself into the game with a zest and enthusiasm which at once compelled attention, and won him his 'flannels' in his first term, and after playing up well in the first great match in the autumn term of the same year he was given his cap. He thus got his cap whilst still in his fourteenth year, and was the youngest boy in the whole...", "...the vote may be said to have been a very decided one, if not positively unanimous.

The consumption of the banana has increased with greater rapidity than any other fruit, and it occupies a position second to none as a food and fruit.

At the opposite end of the palace is situated the picture gallery, which opens into another garden department, with hornbeam hedges, and numerous box edging scrolls; but this piece of ground is evidently not much attended to: the walks, flowers, borders, are not in good order. The collection of paintings, however, in the gallery will infinitely repay the visitor for the disappointment he may experience in the badly kept garden. This gallery is two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> feet long, and thirty-six feet wide; the dome and cove ceiling are richly gilt, the floor and walls inlaid with marble. The paintings are very numerous, and in beautiful preservation.

Joseph Greene has called attention to the striking harmony between the colours of those British moths which are on the wing in autumn and winter, and the prevailing tints of nature at those seasons. In autumn various shades of yellow and brown prevail, and he shows that out of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> species that fly at this season, no less than forty-two are of corresponding colours. Orgyia antiqua, O. gonostigma, the genera Xanthia, Glaea, and Ennomos are examples. In winter, gray and silvery tints prevail, and the genus Chematobia and several species of Hybernia which fly during this season are of corresponding hues. No doubt if the habits of moths in a state of nature were more closely observed, we should find many cases of special protective resemblance.

The fortress of Antonia, seventy feet high, stood on a rock of ninety feet elevation, with precipitous sides. High above all these towers and hills, and fortresses, stood the temple, on an esplanade covering a square of a furlong on each side. The walls which surrounded this fortress-temple were built of vast stones, and were of great height; and within these walls, on each side, was a spacious double portico <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> and a half feet broad, with a ceiling of cedar exquisitely carved, supported by marble columns forty-three and three-quarters feet high, hewn out of single stones. There were one hundred and sixty-two of these beautiful columns.

These doors, or gates, were fifty-two and a...", "...lines the streets. The whole performance, apart from its great antiquity, is of interest as being a local and original representation of the Biblical story--a sort of Flemish passion play, less refined and artistic than that of the Swiss peasants of Oberammergau, but none the less conscientious, earnest and sincere.

In 1297 it was besieged by Robert, the Count of Artois, who fell five years later at the great battle of Courtrai. At Furnes the French arms were successful and the city was captured and sacked, \"more than two thousand houses being burned in two days,\" according to the contemporary chronicles.

In all, the body of the abbe received <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> dagger thrusts, of which twenty-four would have been mortal.

The place was invested on the evening of the fourteenth, and the garrison capitulated the next morning. The late movement of the British army had left the garrison of Ninety Six and of Augusta exposed to the whole force of Greene, and he determined to direct his operations against them.

The country was wild and rugged, and ruled by thirty or forty different chiefs. Each of these chiefs had to be negotiated with and won over, and each in his own way.

The average rate of the movement of the water in the canals is about fifty-one miles a day, and it takes about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> days for the water to pass from about latitude 72 deg. down to the equator, a distance of 2650 miles. This rate of flow, as indicated by the darkening arising from the growth of vegetation which follows the flow of the water down the canals, has been observed and noted many times at Flagstaff Observatory.

There were half a dozen candidates, including both Ritter and Coulter, and Ritter did all he could to get the boys who had voted for Baxter to support him, and then bribed Coulter to step out in his favor. But Jack, Pepper and Bart Conners worked hard for Harry Blossom, as agreed, and as a consequence Harry was elected on the third ballot by <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> votes. \"Hurrah for Harry Blossom!\" was the cry, and the newly-elected captain of Company A was congratulated on all sides. This election was followed by that for a captain for Company B. Here the struggle was as fierce as before, but Dave Kearney won out on the sixth ballot. Then came ballots for the lieutenants, and Bob Grenwood came out strong with fifty-five votes.

Starting across the sea on Friday could have no possible effect upon the winds, or waves, or tides, any more than starting on any other day, and the only possible reason for thinking Friday unlucky is the assertion that it is so. So it is thought by many that it is dangerous for thirteen people to dine together. Now, if thirteen is a dangerous number, twenty-six ought to be twice as dangerous, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> four times as terrible. It is said that one of the thirteen will die in a year. Now, there is no possible relation between the number and the digestion of each, between the number and the individual diseases.

He met Livia, the wife of this Tiberius Claudius Nero, and duly did divorce Livia. A new wedding followed, in which Claudius Nero acted the part of father to his ex-wife, and gave her away to Octavian. It all sounds very disgraceful; but this must be said: the great Augustus could never have done his great work so greatly had he not had at his side the gracious figure of the empress Livia,-- during the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years that remained to him his serenest counselor and closest friend. And then--there was the boy: I believe the most important element in the transaction. His father died soon afterwards, and he came to live in the palace, under the care of his mother,--and of Augustus; who had now within his own family circle the two egos with whom he was most nearly concerned, and without whom his work would have been impossible.

Mr. Storrow says the average progress in the European tunnels was about thirty _feet per month_.

The value of the exports to Great Britain, at the close of the year ending with September, 1789, was nearly double those made to France in the same period: and even the average of the years 1790, 1791 and 1792, gave an annual excess to the exports to Great Britain of three millions, seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> thousand, seven hundred and sixty dollars. The great amount of merchandise imported from Britain, instead of being a grievance, demonstrated, in the opinion of Mr. Smith, the utility of the trade with that country.

This is being paid off out of the successive surpluses of annual revenue over expenditure. In 1856 after the Crimean War, the Debt stood at eight hundred and twenty-nine millions, or about L29, 12s. per head of the population. In 1895 it had been reduced to six hundred and sixty millions, or about L17, 6s. per head of the population.

The game can be played with any kind of cards, and with sides or by individuals. The largest number of cards thrown into the hat, either by one person or by a side, makes the winning score.

The quantity of land allotted to a whole session is fixed for each county. In the county of Neutra, for instance, it varies, according to the quality of the soil, from twenty to thirty _joch_, each equal to nearly an English statute acre and a half; and of these sixteen or twenty must be arable and the rest meadow.

The volume and variety of their work is astonishing. They left more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> printed plays, and all of these show an extraordinary power of invention; the most diverse passions, characters, and situations enter into the work, their stories stimulate our curiosity, and their characters appeal to our sympathies.

It is a lithograph in one colour, and measures fifty by <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> inches.

Having burned the gates, and made three breaches in the walls, Oglethorpe then proceeded to reconnoitre the town and castle. Assisted by some ships of war lying at anchor off St. Augustine bar, he determined to blockade the town. For this purpose he left Colonel Palmer, with ninety-five Highlanders and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> Indians, at Fort Moosa, with instructions to scour the woods and intercept all supplies for the enemy; and, for safety, encamp every night at different places. This was the only party left to guard the land side.

Considering the nature of the work, it is amazing, and greatly to the credit of all engaged, that so few accidents occurred during the building of the lighthouse. When they were in the act of hoisting the sixth and last log, and just about to kant it into its place, the iron hook of the principal purchase-block gave way, and the great beam, measuring fifty feet in length, fell upon the rock with a terrible crash; but although there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> men around the beacon at the time, not one was touched, and the beam itself received no damage worth mentioning. Soon after the beacon had been set up, and partially secured to the rock, a severe gale sprang up, as if Ocean were impatient to test the handiwork of human engineers.

As speedily as might be, the king and his parliament then sitting at Oxford, sought to restore the city on a scale vastly superior to its former condition.

The doctor set down sixty-four, and thenceforth the echo moved too fast for him, also. After the separate concussions could no longer be noted, the reverberations dwindled to a wild, long-sustained clatter of sounds such as a watchman's rattle produces. It is likely that this is the most remarkable echo in the world.

The day chosen for its accomplishment was the fifth of November, 1605, the day on which Parliament met at Westminster. Everything was in readiness. Thirty-six barrels of gunpowder (not <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> as the Hampshire rhyme has it) were stored beneath the Parliament House. And Guido Fawkes, a daring adventurer, was in waiting in the cellar to set a light to them, and blow up King, Prince, and Parliament.

Perhaps my study of the human frame, and my knowledge of the vital property of the air, and of the philosophy of the vital functions, may have added to my distress.

If we are to consider wages in relation to the needs of the worker, therefore, it is the year rather than the week which should be taken as the unit.

Still full of faith in his ability to produce a successful submarine, Bauer now went to Russia. In 1855, he built a boat at St. Petersburg and had it accepted by the Russian Government. It was called _Le Diable Marin_ and looked very much like a dolphin. Its length was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> feet, its beam twelve feet five inches, and its depth eleven feet. Its hull was of iron. A propeller, worked by four wheels, furnished motive power. Submersion and stability were regulated by four cylinders into which water could be pumped at will.

In reality, the intercalation of the Mexicans being thirteen days on each cycle of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years, comes to the same thing as that of the Julian calendar, which is one day in four years; and consequently supposes the duration of the year to be three hundred and sixty-five days, six hours.

His dull eyes were pursy with midnight debauches; his flesh sagged. In contrast with the clean, hard, hawk-eyed miners, he looked blotched and unwholesome. Crossly he snatched from the other two their miner's certificates, made the entries in his book, and gave them their receipts. It was my turn now. I dashed forward eagerly. Then I stopped, for the man with the bleary eyes had shut the wicket in my face. \"Three o'clock,\" he...", "...before the charter expired; and which showed the discounts and loans of the bank to be $14,578,294 25, her capital being $10,000,000; so that the amount of her loans, three months before her dissolution, was nearly in proportion--near enough for all practical views--to the proportion which the present loans of the Bank of the United States bear to its capital of thirty-five millions. Fifty per cent. upon the former would give fifteen millions; fifty per cent. upon the latter would give <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> millions and a half. To make the relative condition of the two banks precisely equal, it will be sufficient that the loans and discounts of the present bank shall be reduced to fifty-two millions by the month of January, 1836; that is to say, it need not make any further sensible reduction of its loans for nearly two years to come. Thus, the mere imitation of the conduct of the old bank will be a relief to the community. A mere cessation to curtail, will put an end to the...", "...and Agamemnon started for the last time for their opposite destinations.\" At this moment the ships were nearly in mid-ocean, but not exactly. Mr. Field, who never indulged in poetical descriptions, but always gave the figures, stating the precise latitude and longitude, and from what quarter the wind blew, and how many fathoms deep the ocean was, and how many miles of cable were on board, made the following entry in his journal: \"Thursday, July twenty-ninth, latitude <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> degrees nine minutes north, longitude thirty-two degrees twenty-seven minutes west.

In the Amphibia and Reptilia, with which groups alone any comparisons are profitable, the lower jaw articulates by means of a quadrate bone, which may be movably or firmly attached to the skull. In the mammals the articulation of the lower jaw is with the squamosal. The nature of this articulation is one of the most debated points in comparative anatomy. Seeing that Professor Kingsley[14] in the most recent contribution to the subject quotes no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> different views, many of which are more or less convergent, it will be obvious that in a work like the present the matter cannot be treated exhaustively. As, however, Professor Kingsley justly says that \"no single bone occupies a more important position in the discussion of the origin of the Mammalia than does the quadrate,\" and with equal justice adds that \"upon the answer given as to its fate in this group depends, in large measure, the broader problem of the phylogeny of...", "...see him, and--he found no one but old Tibaeul the rat-catcher.\" The butler now returned and showed the two friends into a good-sized room, tastefully, but not luxuriously furnished, and in the centre of the room was a large table covered with papers and accounts.

He appeared to be about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> or three, and his hair was of an iron grey colour; he was perhaps shortsighted, for, as he went forward to receive his visitors, he picked up an eye-glass that was lying on the table, but without using it: \"Ah, Mr. Braesig,\" he said quietly, \"what can I do for you?\"--Uncle Braesig now involved himself in such a labyrinth of words in his desire to speak grandly as befitted his company, that he would never have extricated himself if the squire had not come to the rescue....", "...Board of Communication.

Plautus thought it necessary to prefix to many of his plays an account of the incidents which preceded the action of the play. In some cases he went so far as to outline in the prologue the action of the play itself in order that the spectators might follow it intelligently. This introductory narrative runs up to seventy-six lines in the _Menaechmi_, to eighty-two in the _Rudens_, and to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> in the _Amphitruo_. In this way it becomes a short realistic story of every-day people, involving frequently a love intrigue, and told in the iambic senarius, the simplest form of verse. Following it is the more extended narrative of the comedy itself, with its incidents and dialogue. This combination of the condensed narrative in the story form, presented usually as a monologue in simple verse, and the expanded narrative in the dramatic form, with its conversational element,...", "...I can learn there was no exact way of estimating distances by any of those travelers--the speedometer was not invented, nor the odometer, nor the ship's log.

Gee, I have to admit that scouts eat a lot-especially dessert. You can bet I wouldn't want to be a human skeleton.

The 'portrait' itself was a dramatic picture, in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> scenes, without division into acts. The work of Mercier, who paints the Spanish king in the darkest possible colors, furnished a few hints for 'Don Carlos', but its influence was not very great.

The warmer the air, the more moisture it demands, and it will draw it from all objects within reach. The air holds water according to its temperature. Thus, at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> degrees, Fahrenheit's thermometer, it holds half the moisture it can sustain; but at thirty-six degrees, it will hold only one eighty-sixth part. The earth and all plants and trees are constantly sending out moisture; and when the air has received all it can hold, without depositing it as dew, it is said to be _saturated_, and the point of temperature at which dew begins to form, by condensation, upon the surface of the earth and its vegetation, is called the _dew-point_....", "...the awful figures which show a larger mortality from the use of liquor alone than the mortality from all known causes (liquor included), can be verified by taking the trouble to consult the files of the (New York) City Record.

The interior walls above the main arches of the tower, up to the bases of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> pillars, which surround the bellringers' chamber, are in a very ruinous state, particularly at the four angles, where rude cavities, running in a diagonal direction, have been made large enough for a man to creep in,--these unaccountable holes have tended very much to increase the danger, as all the masonry connected with them is drawn off its bond, and many of the stones shivered to pieces by the enormous pressure above. The stone-work, also, above the pillars, is drawn off...", "..._my_ house, Mr Maxwell!\" Before the disputed ball took place, Stanhope and his brother had journeyed on to Rome. On the road thither they again ran great danger from robbers; indeed, at the first town in the Pope's dominions, where they were obliged to submit their baggage to the examination of the custom house officials, a soldier informed them that he had orders not to let an Englishman pass without an efficient guard, and he begged them, to their astonishment, to take an escort of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> men. \"We, however,\" Stanhope relates, \"passed the next stage safely without seeing any robbers, but we were informed that our danger was not yet over, as we had to pass near a wood which was one of their regular haunts.

English merchants were not satisfied with this paltry trade, and smuggling increased. Spanish coast guard ships seized many of the English traders, who received rough handling by the Spanish officials. During 1738 and 1739 public opinion in England became more and more inflamed against Spain. A paper presented to parliament in 1738 showed that in recent years <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> vessels had been plundered by the Spaniards, and that British seamen had been harshly treated. The most famous case was that of Thomas Jenkins, who declared that a coast guard captain had captured him, cut off his ears, and insolently remarked, \"Carry this home to the King, your master, whom, if he were present, I Would serve in like fashion.\" Attempts to settle difficulties by diplomacy failed, and by the summer of 1739 it became evident that war was at hand.

On the top of this massive foundation was built a strong and lofty wall, round the whole area. Within this wall was a spacious double cloister, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> and one half feet broad, supported by one hundred and sixty-two columns. On the south side the cloister was one hundred and five feet wide--being a triple cloister--and was here called the King's Cloister.

However, the King, Queen, and Knave are now the only ones with the French emblems, and these are followed by ten pip cards, in which number one, or the Ace, is sometimes the highest, and, at others, the lowest in the pack, according to the game to be played. In the United States, a pack is incomplete without the Joker, which then makes fifty-three cards to a standard pack. Many writers have tried to connect the number <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> with the weeks of the year, but, as can easily be seen by studying the Tarots, this was not the original number, and the French, when inventing their new set of cards, probably had no such connection in mind, and the Piquet, which is the earliest French pack, contains less than fifty-two cards. The Joker did not make its appearance in the United States until about the middle of the nineteenth century, and then for a rather strange reason.

Thus in the years between May 1st, 1827, and 30th April, 1831, no less than four hundred and fifty-one sentences of death for capital crimes were passed at the Old Bailey; but of these three hundred and ninety-six were reversed by the king in council, and only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> were really executed. Already the severity of our criminal code, and the number of capital felonies upon the statute book, had brought a reaction; and while the courts adhered to the letter of the law, appeals were constantly made to the royal prerogative of mercy.

She was quite sure their father wouldn't trouble his head about them. Perhaps Mrs. Cockayne was right.

Born in 1864 in Hupeh, one of the most important mid-Yangtsze provinces, President Li Yuan-hung was now <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> years old, and in the prime of life; but although he had been accustomed to a military atmosphere from his earliest youth his policy had never been militaristic. His father having been in command of a force in North China for many years, rising from the ranks to the post of _Tsan Chiang_ (Lieutenant-Colonel), had been constrained to give him the advantage of a thoroughly modern training.

In the next room are assembled the oldest pictures of the Dutch School. The next room contains masters of the sixteenth century, and next to it comes Dupper Hall, devoted to the glorious period of Dutch art, the seventeenth century. Here are sixty-four paintings, many of which are masterpieces. Next comes Van der Poll Hall with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> pictures, then the Hall of Anatomy Pictures, and next Portrait Hall. From this we visit the five cabinets, containing such pictures of the Old Dutch School as from their small dimensions and minute finish are best seen in small rooms. On the opposite side of the vestibule are five similar cabinets with similar pictures. Beyond these is Pavilion Hall, containing portraits, many of which are painters' portraits of themselves. Then come the Van der Hoop Museum and two galleries...", "...in 1948. [Footnote 9-43: Norfolk _Journal and Guide_, August 20, 1949.] Lester Granger blamed the lack of black candidates on the fact that so few Negroes attended the schools; undoubtedly, more Negroes would have been enrolled in reserve officer training had the program been established at one of the predominantly black colleges. But black institutions were excluded from the wartime V-12 program, and when the program was extended to include <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> colleges in November 1945 the Navy again rejected the applications of black schools, justifying the exclusion, as it did for many white schools, on grounds of inadequacies in enrollment, academic credentials, and physical facilities.[9-44] Some black spokesmen called the decision discriminatory. President Mordecai Johnson of Howard University ruefully wondered how the Navy's unprejudiced and nondiscriminatory selection of fifty-two colleges managed to exclude so neatly all...", "...gone to the adobe yard to commence building some houses in that region. They have already got many good logs on the ground. Colonel Markham reports that in addition to the plowing done week before last, they have plowed about thirty acres which is mostly planted, making a total of about eighty acres. The plowing ceased last week and the brethren are now making adobes, hauling logs, etc. Elder Sherwood continues surveying the city. Tanner and Frost are setting wagon tires and have set <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> today. The brethren who went to the lake on Monday to boil down salt have returned this evening and report that they have found a bed of beautiful salt ready to load into wagons. It lies between two sand bars and is about six inches thick. They suppose they can easily load ten wagons without boiling. I have received from Elder Kimball a pair of buckskin pants, as a present I suppose, but as I have on similar occasions been branded with the idea of receiving a great many...", "...Idiot. \"It is the Philosophy of the Unconscious again. If you are not conscious of so actual a thing as a sigh, how much the more unconscious must you be of something so subtle as motive?\" \"And your waffle-deck?\" said the Genial Old Gentleman who occasionally imbibes. \"How will that solve the problem? It seems to me to complicate the problem. As it is, we have about thirty waffles, each one of which is a germ of irritation in the breast of the man who _doesn't_ eat it. If you have <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> waffles you have twenty-two more germs to sow discord in our midst.\" \"You would have but for my scheme,\" said the Idiot. \"I'd have a pack of cards at the table, and I'd deal them out just as you do in whist. Each card would represent the corresponding waffle. We'd begin breakfast by playing one hand after the manner of whist. Each man would keep his tricks, and when the waffles were served he would receive those, and those only, represented by the cards in the tricks he had...", "...tallboy chest. After dinner cards were brought forth and _vingt et un_ was played. In a weak moment I volunteered to \"carry\" Jill, who played with an _abandon_ which was at once exhilarating and extremely expensive. Her persistent refusal to \"stand\" on anything less than twenty-one commanded an admiration which, but for my presence, would have been universal. The only run of luck with which her audacity was favoured coincided with my tenure of the bank, during which period she took <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> shillings off me in seven minutes. As I pushed her counters across-- \"I've heard of robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" I said gloomily, \"but never of robbing Charlie to pay Chaplin. Why couldn't you do this when some one else had the bank?\" \"You shouldn't deal me such cards,\" was the ungrateful reply. A moment later she turned up a \"natural\" with a dazzling smile. There was a roar of laughter. \"Of course, this is Berry's luck,\" said I. \"And it needs Berry's tongue to...", "...the case, the day series being apparently of general rather than of special application) it is immaterial which day column is selected, as the result will be the same with any. This will be apparent if we bear in mind that, when 260 days with their numbers attached have been written down in proper order as a series, we have therein all the possible combinations of days and numbers. This, it is true, does not give us all the months and years (to include these it is necessary to write out <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> entire years), but the same series of numerals will be applicable to each of the four year series (Kan, Muluc, Ix, and Cauac years). As any one of the thirteen figure columns of the table may be taken as the commencement of a year and any of the four day columns may be used, it is apparent that we have all the possible combinations (4 x 13 = 52). I say above that \"it is necessary in counting to refer always to the year (year column) which the count begins.\" This I admit...", "...Subject might be omitted in this Abridgement.

Tell me about him.\" \"You would be more likely than most women to appreciate him. Supposing you put the matter to the test. You would not accept these horses, maybe you will not refuse a humbler present--an edition of Balzac. There's a very good one in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> volumes.\" \"So many as that?\" \"Yes; and not one too many--each is a masterpiece. In this enormous work there are something like two thousand characters, and these appear in some books in principal, in other books in subordinate, parts.

Within three weeks of his return to the palace of his forefathers, he was induced to take the field; and he set out northward at the head of 90,000 men, the greater number of whom were Mahratta horsemen. It has already been shown that Zabita Khan had escaped to his own estates a year before. The Bawani Mahal (comprising <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> pergunnahs, now included in the districts of Saharanpur and Muzaffarnaggar) contained three strongholds: Pathargarh on the left, Sukhartal on the right of the Ganges, and Ghausgarh, near Muzaffarnagar. The first two had been built by the late minister, Najib-ud-daulah, to protect the ford which led to his fief in the north-western corner of Rohilkand, for the Ganges is almost always fordable here, except in the high floods. The last was the work of Zabita Khan himself, and...", "...Channel, which condition obtains during a great part of each year. The descriptions of the region by Morton in his report, though simple, are yet so accurate and free from exaggeration as to prove conclusively his entire honesty. When, however, his astronomical observations and estimates of distances are considered, Morton's incompetency is apparent, as they are, in common with most of the other field work, erroneous and misleading. The latitude of Cape Constitution was overstated <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> geographic miles by Kane and thirty-one miles by Morton, while Kennedy Channel, instead of being thirty-five miles wide, ranges only from seventeen to twenty-five. The farthest mountain seen was Mount Ross, on the north side of Carl Ritter Bay, about 80 deg. 58' N., more than ninety miles to the southward of its assumed position. Kane's personal knowledge of Morton's honesty was so complete that he placed equal confidence in his ability and accuracy, an error of judgment...", "...it is easy to string out a correspondence from any locality; but it is unspeakable hardship to write editorials. Subjects are the trouble--the dreary lack of them, I mean. Every day, it is drag, drag, drag--think, and worry and suffer--all the world is a dull blank, and yet the editorial columns must be filled. Only give the editor a subject, and his work is done--it is no trouble to write it up; but fancy how you would feel if you had to pump your brains dry every day in the week, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> weeks in the year. It makes one low spirited simply to think of it. The matter that each editor of a daily paper in America writes in the course of a year would fill from four to eight bulky volumes like this book! Fancy what a library an editor's work would make, after twenty or thirty years' service. Yet people often marvel that Dickens, Scott, Bulwer, Dumas, etc., have been able to produce so many books. If these authors had wrought as voluminously as newspaper...", "...that territory and pushes the cyclone off the coast at Hatteras or even makes them drift across the country to Florida. But such occasions are exceptional. Give the ordinary cyclone its head, and, ten to one, you will find it on the way to the St. Lawrence. The inhabitants will confirm this statement, I am sure. They do not feel discriminated against in the matter of weather. They get nearly everything that is going. Since they have to accommodate from seventy to eighty cyclones in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> weeks they have very little time to brood over any one variety of weather. With the optimism of that section of the country they say, \"If you don't like our weather, wait a minute.\" Ten storms a year originate over the Rocky Mountain Plateau, north of Colorado. About twenty cross over from the Canadian Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. And all our other storms, about forty each year, enter our country from the North Pacific by way of Washington and Oregon. Many of...", "...females. If, therefore, the Osmia, who is very economical of her space, wishes to occupy them, she will be obliged to establish males there. And her laying must necessarily begin here, because this corner is the rear-most part of the tube. The foremost gallery is wide, with an entrance-door on the front of the hive. Here, finding the conditions to which she is accustomed, the mother will go on with her laying in the order which she prefers. Let us now see what has happened. Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-two</span> double-galleried tubes, about a third did not have their narrow passage colonized. The Osmia closed its aperture communicating with the large passage; and the latter alone received the eggs. This waste of space was inevitable. The female Osmiae, though nearly always larger than the males, present marked differences among one another: some are bigger, some are smaller. I had to adjust the width of the narrow galleries to Bees of average dimensions. It may happen therefore that..."]
