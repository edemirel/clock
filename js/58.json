In the first month of the war the Frauendienst opened work-rooms in all great centers; machinery was installed by magic and through the six work-rooms in Berlin alone twenty-three thousand women were given paid employment in one week.

Eighty percent of the women's hat-makers and milliners were out of work, seventy-two percent of the workers in glass and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> percent in china. The Frauendienst investigated two hundred and fifty-five thousand needy cases, and in Berlin alone found sixty thousand women who had lost their employment. Charity had to render help.

Neither the cost of the valuable manuscript nor the opposition and vigilance of an almost omnipresent inquisition were able to suppress it. Wyclif was now about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years of age. He had rendered a transcendent service to the English nation, and a service that not one of his contemporaries could have performed,--to which only the foremost scholar and theologian of his day was equal.

The telescopic observations of Herschel I. satisfied him that there are very many double stars--double not merely because they are accidentally in the same line of view, but because they are connected physically, revolving round each other. These observations were continued and greatly extended by Herschel II. The elements of the elliptic orbit of the double star zeta of the Great Bear were determined by Savary, its period being <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> and one-quarter years; those of another, sigma Coronae, were determined by Hind, its period being more than seven hundred and thirty-six years. The orbital movement of these double suns in ellipses compels us to admit that the law of gravitation holds good far beyond the boundaries of the solar system; indeed, as far as the telescope can reach, it demonstrates the reign of law.

At a much later epoch, in the second century B.C., fifteen towns of Liguria contained altogether, as we learn from Livy, but twenty thousand souls. It is plain, then, what must really have been-- even admitting their existence--the three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> towns of Umbria. However, at the end of two or three centuries, this Gallic colony succumbed beneath the superior power of the Etruscans, another set of invaders from eastern Europe, perhaps from the north of Greece, who founded in Italy a mighty empire.

Which was the Itinerist? Mr. Cowan, going by age, thinks that the Itinerist can hardly have been the Joseph Taylor who was admitted to the Inn in 1663, as in that case he must have been at least <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> when he travelled to Edinburgh. For my part, I see nothing in the _Itinerary_ to preclude the possibility of its author having attained that age at the date of its composition. I observe in the _Itinerary_ references which point to the Itinerist being a Kentish man, and he mentions more than once his 'Cousin D'aeth.' Research among the papers of the D'aeths of Knowlton Court, near Dover, might result in the discovery which of these two Taylors really was the Itinerist.

During the Revolution the merchantmen went generally to decay or were captured. Some were equipped as privateers. But after seven years a ship is in its dotage. New vessels were built and armed.

At least five hundred armed vessels were fitted out in the commercial States, and among them one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> from the single port of Salem. Some of these vessels mounted twenty guns; they captured large numbers of English vessels, and performed feats on the ocean as brilliant as any upon the land.

Our ships had improved in size and speed, and were manned by officers and seamen who had measured their strength with Englishmen, and acknowledged no...", "...he bore the anti-slavery standard almost alone in the halls of Congress, a unique and picturesque figure, rousing every demon of hatred in his fellow-members, in constant and envenomed battle with them, and more than a match for them all. He fought single-handed for the right of petition as an indefeasible right, not hesitating to submit a petition from citizens of Virginia praying for his own expulsion from Congress as a nuisance. In 1836 he presented a petition from one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> ladies, citizens of Massachusetts, \"for, I said, I had not yet brought myself to doubt whether females were citizens.\" After eight years of persistent struggle against the \"Atherton gag law,\" which practically denied the right of petition in matters relating to slavery, he carried a vote rescinding it, and nothing of the kind was again enacted.

Mr. Wilberforce stated that he had no objection to such a measure; believing the greater the number present the more favourable it would be to his cause. This motion, however, produced a debate and a division, in which it appeared that there were one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> in favour of it, and twenty-eight against it.

On finishing his course at Oxford, he went on foot to Edinburgh,--more than three hundred miles. He was equally remarkable as a leaper, surpassing all competitors. He once jumped across the Cherwell--twenty-three feet clear--with a run of only a few yards. This is, we believe, the greatest feat of the kind on record. General...", "...ECHOES. Various remarkable echoes, and some not very credible, have been described by different authors. Dr. Plott mentions an echo in Woodstock Park, which repeats seventeen syllables by day and twenty by night. The famous echo at the Marquess Simonetta's villa, near Milan, has been described both by Addison and Keysler. According to the last of these travellers, it is occasioned by the reflection of the voice between the opposite parallel wings of the building, which are <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> paces from each other, without any windows or doors, and perpendicularly to the main body of the building. The repetition of the sound dwells chiefly on the last syllable. A man's voice is repeated about forty times, and the report of a pistol about sixty times; but the repetitions are so rapid, that it is difficult to number them, unless it be early in the morning, or in a calm, still evening.

But even then, in many important respects, the government was strong.

It would be impossible to omit the name of Handel, the great _thorough bass_ of musical composition, to whom Mozart confessed that every subsequent composer had been signally indebted. He is, by adoption and patronage, the property of the English school. It may not be unacceptable to add, that he composed, besides his other numerous works, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> pieces, of which thirteen were Italian operas, many of which were successful.[11] The famous contest between Handel and Buononcini in Italian composition was decided in favour of the former by public acclamation.

During the next twenty-four hours I rode from Fort Hays to Fort Dodge, ninety-five miles. The following night I traveled from Fort Dodge to Fort Larned, thirty miles on mule back and thirty-five miles on foot, in twelve hours, and the next night sixty-five miles more from Fort Larned to Fort Hays. Altogether I had ridden and walked three hundred and sixty-five miles in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> hours, an average of over six miles an hour. Taking into consideration the fact that most of this riding was done in the night over wild country, with no roads to follow, and that I had continually to look out for Indians, it was regarded at the time as a big ride as well as a dangerous one. What I have set down here concerning it can be verified by referring to the autobiography of General Sheridan. General Sheridan complimented me highly on this achievement. He told...", "...out in a week or ten days. I'll keep an eye over you until you are well. S'long, Jack.\" The second week fell short only two herds of the previous one. There were fully as many cattle passed, and under the heat of advancing summer the pools suffered a thirsty levy. The resources of the ponds were a constant source of surprise, as an occasional heavy beef caved a foot into an old beaver warren, which poured its contents into the pools. At the end of the first fortnight, after watering <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> herds, nearly half the original quantity of water was still in reserve. A third week passed. There was a decided falling off in the arrival of herds, only twenty-two crossing the Beaver. The water reserves suffered freely, more from the sun's absorption than from cattle, until the supply became a matter of the most serious concern. The pools would not have averaged a foot in depth, the flow from the springs was a mere trickle, the beaver burrows sounded empty to a horse's...", "...a half a mile at the north of the ford, they struck the foot hill; and one could see nothing but a moving, black mass, as far as the eye could see. I do not remember how long we were going from there to Bent's Fort, but we got there on the second of July, 1847, and every white man that was within three hundred miles was there, which were just sixteen.

Most of them laid down under the trees. One of our men shot a bird that was in a tree close by, and I never heard such shouting or saw such running as these Indians did when the gun cracked. This convinced me that we were the first white men they had ever seen, and this the first time they had heard the report of a gun. This incident occurred in forty-eight, which was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years ago. I have seen more or less of these Indians from that time until now, and these Indians as a tribe have made less progress than any other Indians in the west.

After crossing the Colorado river we came into the Ute country, but we traveled several days without seeing any of this tribe. About five days after we crossed the Colorado river, we...", "...and soon had the Indian horses on the dead run up the hill, and on the prairie where we had told the Capt. to come and look for us.

They watched it through one season, and found that it killed <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> birds, including the young in five nests. Nearly a hundred correspondents, scattered through all the counties of the state, report the cat as one of the greatest enemies of birds.

We rose hurriedly and rushed to the window, but in the hurry my brother dashed against a table, and down went something with a smash; on getting a light we found it was nothing more valuable than a water-bottle and glass, the broken pieces of which we carefully collected together, sopping up the water as best we could. We were in time to see our friend off on the coach, with three horses and an enormous light in front, which travelled from Thurso to Helmsdale, a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> miles, at the rate of eight miles per hour. (_Distance walked twenty-one and a half miles._) _Wednesday, September 20th._ We rose early, and while waiting for our breakfast talked with an old habitue of the hotel, who, after drawing our attention to the weather, which had now changed for the worse, told us that the building of the new pier, as he called it, at Wick had been in progress for seven or eight years, but the sea there was the stormiest in Britain, and...", "...The ancient pulpit was of the same period as the screen, as were also the old-fashioned, straight-backed, oak pews.

John Prince, author of _The Worthies of Devon_, published in 1901, who died in 1723, was vicar there for forty-two years, and was succeeded by the Rev. Joseph Fox, who died in 1781, aged eighty-four, having been vicar for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years. He was followed by the Rev. John Edwards, who was vicar for fifty-three years, and died in 1834 aged eighty-three. This list was very different from that we had seen at Hungerford, and we wondered whether a parallel for longevity in three successive vicars existed in all England, for they averaged fifty-one years' service.

On the 21st of November, as we were standing towards Borneo, we made two small islands, which I judged to be the same that in the French chart are called Taba Islands: They are very small, and covered with trees. By my account, they lie in latitude 1 deg. 44' N., longitude 7 deg. 32 W. off the south end of Mindanao, and are distant from Hummock, or Stroomen Point, about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> leagues. The weather was now hazy, but happening suddenly to clear up, we saw a shoal, with breakers, at the distance of about five or six miles, from the south to the north-west. Off the north end of this shoal we saw four hummocks close together, which we took for small islands, and seven more from the S. 1/2 W. to the W. 1/2 S.: Whether these are really islands, or some hills on the island of Borneo, I could not determine. This shoal is certainly very dangerous, but may...", "...from which it is distant about one hundred and twelve leagues. Its distance west from the islands of Salombo is thirty-one leagues. We went to the northward of this island, and found a current setting to the W.N.W. In the evening of Sunday the 29th, we saw the cluster of small islands called Carimon-Java. The latitude of the eastermost, which is also the largest, is 5 deg. 48' S. and its longitude, west of Tonikaky, 7 deg. 52'. From this island it is distant about one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> leagues, and forty-five leagues from Luback. On Thursday the 2d of June, we hauled in and made the land of Java, which proved to be that part of the island which makes the eastermost point of the Bay of Batavia, called Carawawang Point.

As we steered along the shore for Batavia, we decreased them gradually, still farther, to...", "...to be 16 deg. 30'West. SECTION II. _The Passage from Madeira to Rio de Janeiro, with some Account of the Country, and the Incidents that happened there_. On the 21st of September we saw the islands called the Salvages, to the north of the Canaries; when, the principal of these bore S. 1/2 W. at the distance of about five leagues, we found the variation of the compass by an azimuth to be 17 deg. 50.

More than sixty millions of dollars have been invested in a great number of forts and guns, with all the complicated and scientific machinery and electrical appliances necessary for their use.

The number of men necessary to perform this duty alone is ascertained by the War Department, at a minimum allowance, to be 18,420. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> or more military posts in the United States other than the coast-defense fortifications. The number of these posts is being constantly increased by the Congress. More than $22,000,000 have been expended in building and equipment, and they can only be cared for by the Regular Army.

This rise in prices was coincident with the \"wild-cat\" prosperity, which followed a rapid multiplication of state banks with the right of issue of paper currency--largely irredeemable \"wild-cat\" currency. Cost of living having doubled, the subject of wages became a burning issue. At the same time the general business prosperity rendered demands for higher wages easily attainable. The outcome was a luxuriant growth of trade unionism. In 1836 there were in Philadelphia <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> trade unions; in Newark, New Jersey, sixteen; in New York, fifty-two; in Pittsburgh, thirteen; in Cincinnati, fourteen; and in Louisville, seven. In Buffalo the journeymen builders' association included all the building trades. The tailors of Louisville, Cincinnati, and St. Louis made a concentrated effort against their employers in these three cities. The wave of organization reached at last the women workers. In 1830 the well-known Philadelphia philanthropist, Mathew...", "...they are usually hollow, and consequently bulged there, while the tulip springs boldly out of the ground a solid shaft of clear, clean, and sweetly-fragrant wood, sixty or seventy feet of the bole being often entirely without limbs, with an average diameter of from three to five feet.

Defoe's career was so full that both his chief biographers[155] have found three large volumes to be necessary to do it justice. And yet it was not until near the end of that busy life, when the author was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years old, feeling the approach of age and infirmity, and looking about for means to provide for a large family, that he added the writing of novels to his multifarious occupations. There is probably no writer with whose works his life and personality are more intimately connected. It is impossible to consider the one separate from the other. Defoe began to write novels as a tradesman, as a literary hack, and as a reformer.

Taps had sounded and the crew were asleep in their hammocks, when, by a terrific explosion, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> men and two officers were hurled into eternity, sixty more were wounded, and the superb battle-ship was reduced to a mass of shapeless wreckage. It was firmly believed throughout the United States that this appalling disaster was caused by a submarine mine, deliberately placed near the mooring buoy to which the _Maine_ had been moved, to be exploded at a favorable opportunity by Spanish hands. The Spaniards, on the other side, claimed and strenuously maintained that...", "...that place to such an extent, that an attack was considered (and on this occasion there was no difference of opinion) most unadvisable. So we fell back on Sveaborg, which place was bombarded by the combined fleets, I venture to think most successfully, and I believe, had we had a force to land, we could have taken possession of that large and important fortress. Our losses during the operation were small on board the squadron of mortar-boats which I had the good luck to command--some <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> men _hors de combat_. In this service I received my promotion to the rank of commander, and returned to England. Peace was made between Russia and England, previous to which, however, I was appointed to a vessel in the Mediterranean which formed part of the fleet off Sebastopol. Unfortunately, I arrived too late to see much active service there. While serving as a commander in the Mediterranean, I was principally under the command of Sir Wm.

Although the fierce nature of the struggle that Delhi had gone through in 1857 was apparent everywhere, the inhabitants seemed now to have forgotten all about it.

In the latter half of his reign, Dungi, the conqueror, was installed as high priest at Eridu. It would thus appear that there was a renascence of early Sumerian religious ideas. Ea, the god of the deep, had long been overshadowed, but a few years before Dungi's death a temple was erected to him at Nippur, where he was worshipped as Dagan. Until the very close of his reign, which lasted for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years, this great monarch of tireless activity waged wars of conquest, built temples and palaces, and developed the natural resources of Sumer and Akkad. Among his many reforms was the introduction of standards of weights, which received divine sanction from the moon god, who, as in Egypt, was the measurer and regulator of human transactions and human life. To this age also belongs many of the Sumerian business and legal records, which were ultimately carried off to...", "...by the Volscians and AEqui, and lost a good deal of ground, though they were too proud to own it.

When his dying day came, he met it calmly. He asked if there was any fear of a tumult on his death, and was told there was none; then he called for a mirror, and saw that his grey hair and beard were in order, and, asking his friends whether he had played his part well, he uttered a verse from a play bidding them applaud his exit, bade Livia remember him, and so died in his seventy-seventh year, having ruled <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years--ten as a triumvir, forty-eight alone.

Nine thousand one hundred and fifty dollars he paid for the tract, which ten years later brought eighty thousand dollars, and for part of which the Brick Church paid <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> thousand dollars in 1856.

The more dissimilar the chemical characters of two liquids, the more diverse usually was the order of rapidity of corrosion of a series of metals in them.

Corrosion is not the cause of thermo-electric action of metals in liquids.

The essential part of this ordination is the burning of the candidate's head in from three to eighteen places. The operation involves considerable pain and is performed by lighting pieces of charcoal set in a paste which is spread over the shaven skull.

The year is divided into two periods of wandering, two of meditation and one of repose corresponding to the old Vassa. Though this division has become somewhat theoretical, it is usual for monks to set out on excursions in the spring and autumn. In each month there are six fasts, including the two uposatha days. On these latter the 250 rules of the Pratimoksha are recited in a refectory or side hall and subsequently the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> rules of the Fan-wang-ching are recited with greater ceremony in the main temple.

This tragedy, ascribed by the American public to the malevolence of Spanish officials, profoundly stirred an already furious nation.

The official salaries of 1899, estimated at L1,216,000, included a sum of L326,640 for the police. We have seen what kind of police it is. The legislature is composed of two Volksraads, each consisting of twenty-nine members; or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> in all. Now the estimate of salaries for the legislature is L43,960, or about L758 each, more than double the allowances of the French senators and deputies. It is somewhat imprudent of Dr. Kuyper to refer to the educational expenditure. The expenditure amount allocated for the education of the children of Uitlanders in 1896, was L650, or at the rate 1s. 10d. per head, while the gross estimate for education in the budget for that year amounted to L63,000, which works thus...", "...20th, refute this allegation. 3.--_The Ultimatum._ These two despatches received no reply.

But note--only sixteen and one-half million acres were under cultivation.

The land area of the three prairie provinces is four hundred and sixty-six million acres.

After the interview between the 'sainted' King Edward and Harold, the latter starts on his mission to 'Duke William,' and in the next group we see Harold, '_en marche_,' with a hawk on his wrist--then entering a church (the ancient abbey of Bosham, in Sussex), and the clergy praying for his safety before...", "...ounces each; under these, and at the bottom, was a long, narrow, linen bag, filled with ten pounds of flour.

In this book there is no use of gold, and the treatment of the human form is most inadequate.

It is plain that by far the greater part of the \"Victorian\" literature was produced in the former half and quite the inferior part of it was produced in the latter half. By the year 1866 we had already got all, or all that was best, of Tennyson, Browning, Carlyle, Ruskin, Lytton, Thackeray, Dickens, Trollope, George Eliot, Disraeli, Kingsley, and others who lived after that date.

The death of Mr Skinner's wife, in the year 1799, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years after their marriage, was the most severe trial which he seems to have experienced. In a Latin elegy, he gave expression to the deep sense which he entertained of his bereavement.

At the present time the mountaineers as a class, from the Circassians of the Black Sea coast to the Lesghians of the Caspian, may be roughly described as a fierce, hardy, liberty-loving people, whose component members have descended from ancestors of widely different origin, and are separable into tribes or clans of very different outward appearance, but nevertheless alike in all the...", "...this, at a depth varying from two feet to four feet, were twenty-six axes and hammer-stones of flint, two hammer-stones of Sarsen, and a large maul of the same material weighing over sixty-four pounds.

The Southern people were still suffering from the delusion of Bull Run and had not had time to adjust themselves to the amazing defeats suffered at Fort Henry and Fort Donaldson, to say nothing of the stunning victory of the _Monitor_ in Hampton Roads, which had opened the James to the gates of the Confederate Capital. Jackson was ordered into the Shenandoah Valley to execute the...", "...sells 1,000l. worth more of cattle, and 1,000l. worth of sheep and wool, besides oats and various other produce. While this one-thousand-acre farm was let to tenants, it yielded its proprietor an average rental of 17s. an acre. No person acquainted with farming would for an instant assume that a small tenant could make nearly as much out of his land as the farmer of a thousand acres; but allowing for all this, 14s. 3d. per acre appeared a very low rate to the landlord of the farm of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> acres occupied for the last half-century by the Walsh family. I gather that the grandfather of D. Walsh held the farm from the grandfather of the present landlord; that the original occupant was succeeded by his son; that on the son's death his widow retained undisturbed possession until her son was old enough to assume the management, and that then the landlord required 20s. per acre from him. To the landlord it seemed that the Walsh family had had a good bargain. He was...", "...the enemy was no less satisfactory. When full particulars of the Fairfax raid reached Washington, Wyndham vanished from the picture, being assigned to other duties where less depended upon him. There was a whole epidemic of courts-martial and inquiries, some of which were still smouldering when the war ended. And Stoughton, the principal victim, found scant sympathy. President Lincoln, when told that the rebels had raided Fairfax to the tune of one general, two captains, thirty men and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> horses, remarked that he could make all the generals he wanted, but that he was sorry to lose the horses, as he couldn't make horses. As yet, there was no visible re-enforcement of the cavalry in Fairfax County from the front, but the line of picket posts was noticeably shortened. About two weeks later, with forty men, Mosby raided a post at Herndon Station, bringing off a major, a captain, two lieutenants and twenty-one men, with a horse apiece.

A subsidy of a tenth and fifteenth was fixed by Edward III. at twenty-nine thousand pounds, which, in the reign of Henry VI., made only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> thousand pounds of our present money. The parliament granted only one subsidy during the course of seven years, from 1437 to 1444.

In consequence of this, Pitt received the personal commands of his majesty to form a new administration, offering him a _carte blanche_ for its formation. Hitherto Pitt had manifested great patriotism, having served his country, apparently, for the love of it alone. That he was ambitious, however, he now proved. In reply to his majesty's commands he spoke of his infirmities, and--although he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years old--of his great age. Under these circumstances he proposed taking to himself not the premiership, with the direction of the house of commons, but the office of privy-seal, which implied his exaltation to the peerage.

While the country was agitated by the mutiny of the fleets, Mr. Grey rose in the house of commons to move \"for a sweeping reform in parliament.\" This motion was seconded by Fox and others of his party; but it was lost by a majority of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> against ninety-three. Not one of the Foxites could have expected that the motion would pass; but pretending to despair of succeeding in their plan of reform, Fox and most of his friends seceded from parliament, declaring that their attendance there was useless. Some of them returned subsequently to their seats, but none of them attended during Parker's mutiny; and from this time till the year 1800 Fox spoke only three or four times in the house. Sheridan refused to secede;...", "...was wrung from him, because he thought it more correctly represented the state of things; but if he could bring himself to think that the effect of the amendment would be to displace the present government, he would vote for the address. Mr. Spring Rice expressed himself to the same effect. But these declarations of the leading members of opposition did not prevent their adherents from carrying their votes to the ministry; and the amendment was negatived by a majority of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> against one hundred and five. On the following day, when the report on the address was brought up, the Marquis of Blandford moved that the following extraordinary amendment, which he termed, \"a wholesale admonition to the throne,\" should be appended to the address:--\"That this house feels itself called upon, in the awful and alarming state of universal distress into which the landed, commercial, and all the great productive interests of the country are at this moment...", "...changed their opinion regarding the propriety of reducing the numbers of the house, and would try to carry that clause in the bill, still \"they were not prepared to say that this was a question of such essential and vital importance, that, if the feelings of the house were strongly shown in a desire to keep up the present number, they might not be induced to relax their determination on that point. If it should appear to be the sense of the house that the whole number of six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> members should be retained, the government would not feel that they were altering a vital or essential part of the measure by agreeing to that proposition.\" On the following day Mr. Stanley, when adverting to the same topic, to prevent any misconception that ministers, though they might consent to retain the numbers, would leave them to the boroughs, stated, that they were determined to adhere in all circumstances to the disfranchisement of every borough whose population...", "...would go to ruin, and the proprietors be reduced to beggary. In fact, he said, if Mr. Buxton's motion should be carried, he must be prepared to see the whole frame of civilization in the colonies destroyed, and a state of things brought about which, however they might in time settle down into some improvement, must at least begin in barbarism. On a division, Mr. Buxton's amendment was lost by a majority of only seven, one hundred and fifty-one having voted for it, and one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> against it. The result of this division convinced government that they must make some concession on this point; and on the following day Mr. Stanley resolved to reduce the period of prodial apprenticeship from twelve years to seven, and of non-prodial from seven to five years. This was adopted, and clauses were added, empowering the commissioners for the management of the national debt to raise the money by a loan, specifying the manner in which the operation was to be...", "...It was soon discovered that the sixty-three petitioners at Cambridge, by offending the honest principles of many, and the party-spirit of others, had raised a storm which no argument or explanation could allay. Meetings were almost daily held, pamphlets were distributed on every hand, the public press joined in the contest, and the university pulpits resounded with the most awful denunciations. During the excitement at Cambridge, a counter-petition was signed by two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> members, resident and non-resident, comprising eleven heads of houses, eight professors, and twenty-nine tutors; while a second was signed by seven hundred and fifty-five under-graduates and bachelors of arts. These were presented on the 21st of April by the Duke of Gloucester in the lords, as chancellor of the university, and by Mr. Goulburn in the commons, as one of its representatives. A similar document was presented from the university of Oxford by Mr. Estcourt, and on...", "...there was no reason to apprehend an increase of crime from the abolition of the punishment of death in certain offences. He instanced the crime of forgery, which, with the exception of the cases of the forgery of powers of attorney and of bills, was now only punishable by transportation. The number of persons committed for this offence in the three years previous to 1833, was one hundred and fifty-five; and in the three following years two hundred and ten. In the first instance only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> per cent, were convicted; in the latter period the number convicted was seventy-one per cent. From this it appeared that there was no great increase in the number of offences, while the number of convictions was materially increased. The reason of this last effect of the present, criminal law was to be ascribed to the diminished reluctance to prosecute now that the offence was no longer capital. His lordship here stated that in a recent case a man had been tried and...", "...besides several Roman Catholic colleges, and a number of private seminaries for the higher branches of education, two grammar-schools, one at Quebec and the other at Montreal, and in the three districts of Quebec, Montreal, and Three Rivers, thirty-seven free-schools, with nearly two thousand scholars.

The utility of these schools, however, may be estimated by this passage from Lord Durham's report:--\"It came to my knowledge that out of a great number of boys and girls assembled at the school-house door of St. Thomas, all but three were admitted upon inquiry to be unable to read; yet the children of this large parish attend school regularly,...", "...deepest anguish. The conduct of the British was most generous. Each Sikh soldier received a rupee to enable him to reach his home; the cavalry were allowed to retain their horses--a boon which was highly appreciated, many of them expressing, and really feeling, the deepest gratitude.

During the short campaign the enemy had lost one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> pieces of cannon, many of them of larger calibre than any in the English army.

Sixty miles would place her beyond Meulan, which is <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> miles from the Pont Royal, and, of course, a lesser distance from the Pont de Neuilly. But the navigation of the river is difficult at all times, and almost impossible after dark. There were chances of the boat running aground, and then there was the inevitable delay at the locks.

Hebrew tradition (in the J narrative, Genesis x. 11, 12) mentions Calah as built by Nimrod. Modern Arabic tradition likewise ascribes the ruins, like those of Birs Nimrud, near Babylon, to Nimrod, because they are the most prominent ruins of that region. Similarly the ancient dike in the river Tigris at this point is ascribed to Nimrod. The ruin mounds of Nimrud consist of an oblong enclosure, formed by the walls of the ancient city, of which <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> towers have been traced on the N. and about fifty on the E. In the S.W. corner of this oblong is an elevated platform in the form of a rectangular parallelogram, some 600 yds. from N. to S. and 400 yds. from E. to W., raised on an average about 40 ft. above the plain, with a lofty cone 140 ft. high in the N.W. corner.

Veronese is said to have been a man of kindly spirit, generous and devout. In painting for churches and convents, he would consent to receive the smallest remuneration, sometimes not more than the price of his colours and canvas. For his fine picture now in the Louvre, the 'Marriage of Cana,' he is believed not to have had more than forty pounds in our money. He died when he was but <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years of age, in 1588. He had married and left sons who were painters, and worked with their father. He had a brother, Benedotto, who was also a painter, and who is thought to have painted many of the architectural backgrounds to Veronese's pictures.

About the middle of the seventeenth century the ships of the British Navy ceased to carry guns of a similar calibre on the same deck. At the same time the cumbrous forecastles and aftercastles, which must have been equally inconvenient both in action and in a sea way, were removed. The murdering pieces were likewise got rid of, and at the same time, an English ship of war could fire from her broadside half the number of guns she carried. In 1546 Henry the Eighth possessed <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> ships, which were classed according to their quality; thus there were shyppes, galliasses, pinnaces, and row-barges. The galliasse was somewhat like the lugger or felucca of modern days. She probably was a long, low, and sharp-built vessel, propelled by oars as well as sails--the latter not fixed to a standing yard, but hoisted like a boat's sail when required. The pinnace was a small kind of galliasse. In 1612 we find a list in which the vessels of the Royal Navy...", "...sold at sixty- five cents. Everything was sold at a similar profit.

After two years had passed, in October, 1886, Sir Donald Smith increased his endowment to $120,000 in order to provide sufficient income for courses in all four years, and thereby to enable women students to proceed to the B.A. degree. In the session of 1886-87 there were twenty regular and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> partial students enrolled in women's courses, and in 1887-88 the number increased to twenty-six regular and eighty-two partial students. At the end of that session eight women received for the first time the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Higher education for women in McGill was now an assured fact. The Principal's dream had at last been realised. But Dr. Dawson had hope of a still greater development of women's education. He said: \"This great work is not yet complete.

The French placed their loss in killed and mortally wounded at three thousand, so that their total loss could not have been much under seven thousand. Decisive as the victory was, it was the general opinion in the fleet that more ought to have been done; that the five disabled ships should have been taken, and a hot chase instituted after the flying enemy.

In our day Sedge is confined to the genus Carex, a family growing in almost all parts of the world, and containing about 1000 species, of which we have <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> in Great Britain; they are most graceful ornaments both of our brooks and ditches; and some of them will make handsome garden plants. One very handsome species--perhaps the handsomest--is C. pendula, with long tassel-like flower-spikes hanging down in a very beautiful form, which is not uncommon as a wild plant, and can easily be grown in the garden, and the flower-spikes will be found very handsome additions to tall nosegays.

At the distance indicated by this period, the Sun would shrink to the dimensions of a seventh-magnitude star and become invisible to the naked eye; this of itself affords sufficient proof that the great luminary of our system cannot be regarded as one of the leading orbs of the firmament. Stars of the second magnitude have a mean distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> light years, those of the third magnitude ninety-two years, and so on. M. Peters estimated that light from stars of the sixth magnitude, which are just visible to the naked eye, requires a period of 138 years to accomplish its journey hither; whilst light emitted from the smallest stars visible in large telescopes does not reach the Earth until after the lapse of thousands of years from the time of leaving its source.

The calculation then will be easy, and the difference between purchasing and making bread will be seen at once.

On September 3, 1915, a raid nearly 150 miles from the French base was made by two French aviators on Donaueschingen and Marbach in Bavaria. On the same day in retaliation for the German bombardment at Luneville and Compiegne the French air service sent out a squadron of nineteen aeroplanes over the town of Treves, which dropped about 100 shells. The same squadron, after returning to its base, proceeded in the afternoon to drop <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> shells on the station at Dommary and on Baroncour. During September, 1915, the Germans resumed over-sea raids, and naval airships attacked the city of London, with results considered generally satisfactory, as German bombs were dropped on the western part of the city, the factories at Norwich, and the harbor and iron works near Middlesbrough.

Removing from Prince Edward County, he lived for a short time at Long Island, in Campbell County; but in 1795 he finally established himself in the county of Charlotte, on an estate called Red Hill,--an estate which continued to be his home during the rest of his life, which gave to him his...", "...distance from the Canaries would be nearest to his computed run; but currents and errors of the eye necessarily throw this sort of computation out of the question, and Captain G.

My mother, like my father, could and did endure continuous long hours of severe labor without much discomfort. I have known her frequently to patch and mend our clothing until very late at night, and yet she would invariably be up in the morning by four to resume her labors. Small wonder that with such parents and with such early surroundings I am able to say that for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years I was never sick in bed a single day. I, too, have endured long hours of labor during my whole life, and I can truthfully say that I have always liked to do my work and that I never watched for the sun to go down to relieve me from the burden of labor.

This means that in New York State there are 16,000 more deaths each year than if the population were living in Sweden under Swedish conditions and laws. Or, expressed in another way, it means that in Sweden one out of every sixty-five persons dies each year, and in New York one out of every <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> persons. The rate in New York State is high because the state contains a large number of cities, and concentration of population generally implies all kinds of bad and unsanitary conditions. As a rule, a higher death-rate may be expected in a densely populated community than in a sparsely settled one, and we should therefore expect a rural community to show a lower death-rate than a city or urban community. It is not a fair estimate of the health of any rural locality,...", "...outstanding.

Five negroes were broken on the wheel, six hung in chains and starved to death, one of whom lived for nine days and eight nights, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> were burnt at the stake, and about a hundred and thirty imprisoned. These horrible punishments were intended as a warning to the others, and no doubt they had such an effect on that generation.

At the most the blacks had a few days' liberty to murder, burn, and pillage, after which came the terrible retribution.

The music is rapid, there being from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> to sixty full 4/4 counts per minute. It is impossible for me to represent Igorot music, instrumental or vocal, in any adequate manner, but I may convey a somewhat clearer impression of the rhythm if I attempt to represent it mathematically.

At about four o'clock I reached a point about four miles from the Merced river and one or two from the railroad, and could proceed no farther. Spreading my blanket, a single one, on the fog-damp earth, I laid down and slept for about an hour--the first rest and sleep for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> hours, unless it be the short stop I made while at Merced. But the sleep did me more harm than good, as the cold chilled me through and through, and left my limbs so stiff that I could scarcely stand, much less walk. I managed to drag my weary body back to the railroad, and just as I reached it I saw a hand-car coming down the track at a rapid rate. It was going toward the Merced river, to the section-house at that point. One white man and four or five Chinamen were in the...", "...one end to the other, it is ornamented with sculpture.

This courtyard is two hundred and fourteen feet wide, and two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> feet deep. At the time of our first entrance it was overgrown with bushes and grass, quails started up from under our feet, and, with a whirring flight, passed over the tops of the buildings.

The diminution in the percentage of holdings, and production, has gone on steadily, and the percentage is now about ten per cent less than it was ten years ago.

In the nineties, a young man of thirty, his slim frock-coated figure, his narrow, fine features and dark, heavy mustache were familiar in most important court cases, and in the published accounts of them his name always had a prominent place.

There was evidently very little of real disease about him, and yet there was very great debility. All his bodily senses were greatly deranged, and all his intellectual faculties benumbed.

There was no violence or excess of action anywhere, except a slight increase of the circulation. The man was about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years of age. Had he been ninety-eight or even eighty-eight, I should have had no difficulty in understanding his case. I should have said to myself, \"Nature, nearly exhausted by the wear and tear of life, is about to give way;\" or in other words, \"The man is about to did (?die) of mere old age.\" But could he have been thus worn out at the age of fifty-eight?

This always awakened surprise, and led to much and frequent inquiry how it was that a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years could be dying of mere old age. My explanations, whenever attempted,--for sometimes in my pride of profession I wholly evaded them,--were usually, in substance like the following:-- \"Mr. ---- was feeble by inheritance.

His body and mind, both of them, came to maturity very early; which, as you know, always betokens premature decay.

The uniformity of this rate seemed to imply that, at depths quite insignificant, a very high temperature must exist. This was illustrated by such facts that the water which rushes up from a depth of 1794 feet in the Artesian well of Grenelle has a temperature of 82 deg. Fahr. The mean temperature of Paris being about 51 deg. Fahr., these numbers give a rate of 1 deg. for every <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> feet. If, then, the increase of heat is only 100 deg. per mile, at a depth of less than ten miles every thing must be red hot, and at thirty or forty in a melted state.

The general conclusion thus furnished was re-enforced by the evidence of volcanoes, which could no longer be regarded as merely local, depending on...", "...introduced them into that service, and continually improved and perfected their use until they had become the mighty engine of modern warfare and revolutionized the art of coast and harbour defense.

The inspectors consented that he should have his wish, and he was cared for for a month, until his death, which occurred on March 14, 1884.

Who is 'Ruth Ashmore'?' \"You are,\" answered Edward Bok. And while it took considerable persuasion, from that time on Mrs. Mallon became Ruth Ashmore, the most ridiculed writer in the magazine world, and yet the most helpful editor that ever conducted a department in periodical literature. For sixteen years she conducted the department, until she passed away, her last act being to dictate a letter to a correspondent. In those sixteen years she had received one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> thousand letters: she kept three stenographers busy, and the number of girls who to-day bless the name of Ruth Ashmore is legion.

The Committee's work was exceptionally successful; it soon proved of so excellent a quality as to elicit a cabled request from Paris headquarters to send more men of the Philadelphia type.

He was greater after his death than when he was alive, for the grief and the love of the poor encompassed his spirit and made it strong.\" Romulus smiled in the way he did when he was thinking more than he meant to say. \"I shall be very strong when I am dead,\" was his only comment. And Calvo knew that it was the truth. Romulus was now <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years old, and Calvo was seventy-two. Both of them were thinking that it would not be many years when they would both, perhaps, be talking together in the world of shadows as they were talking now. Then Romulus told Calvo what he was going to do. This talk took place a little after the beginning of the fifth month, which the Romans called Quintilis, but which we call July. In this month the sun is hot and the air is sluggish and damp, and in the year when these things...", "...doings were witchcrafts, that is, acts performed either at the instigation or by aid of some mortal who was in covenant with the devil.

Malformations of the ear come next. We are often struck by the frequency of badly defective speech--three times in nine defectives, whilst we did not find a single example in the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> school children taken by chance.

In 1760 he signed the Boston Memorial, and was thus one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> who were the first men in America to array themselves against the officers of the Crown, but like many others that did not favor many acts of the government, he could not tolerate mob rule, and therefore threw his lot in on the side that represented law and authority. When Hancock's sloop Liberty was seized for smuggling in 1768, by the commissioners, the fury of the mob became great. They fell upon the officers, several of whom barely escaped with their lives.

No later opera by Bellini equals \"La Sonnambula\"; none other by Donizetti ranks with \"Lucia di Lammermoor.\" But Verdi, despite the great success of \"Ernani,\" showed seven years later, with \"Rigoletto,\" an amazing progress in dramatic expression and skill in ensemble work. \"Il Trovatore\" and \"La Traviata\" were other works of the period ushered in by \"Rigoletto.\" Eighteen years later the composer, then <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years old, gave evidence of another and even more notable advance by producing \"Aida,\" a work which marks the beginning of a new period in Italian opera. Still not satisfied, Verdi brought forward \"Otello\" (1887) and \"Falstaff\" (1893), scores which more nearly resemble music-drama than opera.

The nave, in its present ruined condition, is two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> feet long, by seventy-nine in breadth. The transept is one hundred and thirty feet long, and forty-four in breadth, which will give some idea of the size of these splendid old edifices of the Romish church.

When the British boarding-officer came over the side, the sight of the carnage was so shocking that he had to lean against a gun for support. The force of the \"Essex\" was forty-six guns and two hundred and fifty-five men. That of the English, in conservative estimates, was seventy-three guns and four hundred and twenty-one men. The English lost five killed and ten wounded. The \"Essex\" <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> killed, sixty-six wounded, and thirty-one missing. Thus died the \"Essex\" in one of the bloodiest and most obstinate combats on record. THE CAPTAIN OF THE MAINTOP James Jarvis was one of the \"young gentlemen\" on the \"Constellation\" during the war with France. \"Young gentlemen\" was what the midshipmen were called in the old naval service, and Jarvis was the youngest of them all, being just thirteen at the time of the action with the \"Vengeance.\" He was the...", "...cleared for action the bulkheads were taken down and all movable property both of officer and man was taken below-deck.

These elements of danger and disorder already pointed out have been strikingly illustrated by a tragic event which has deeply and justly moved the American people. I have already transmitted to Congress the report of the Naval Court of Inquiry on the destruction of the battleship Maine in the harbor of Havana during the night of the 15th of February. The destruction of that noble vessel has filled the national heart with inexpressible horror. Two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> brave sailors and marines and two officers of our navy, reposing in the fancied security of a friendly harbor, have been hurled to death, grief and want brought to their homes and sorrow to the nation. The Naval Court of Inquiry, which, it is needless to say, commands the unqualified confidence of the Government, was unanimous in its conclusions that the destruction of the Maine was caused by an exterior explosion--that of a submarine mine. It did not assume to place the...", "...AND TEACHING. There is a chain of evidences that the rulers of the Church not only enjoined the diligent teaching of the people by their parish priests in sermon[208] and otherwise, but also gave the clergy the assistance of manuals of teaching and sermon helps; and, further, took pains at their visitations to ascertain that the duty was efficiently performed.

The garrison of Fort Fisher had been increased to about double the number of men there on the 24th of December. The iron-clad vessels of the enemy approached nearer the fort than on a former occasion, and the fire of the fleet was more concentrated and vastly more effective.

So, too, the theory that intelligence and morality are in direct proportion to the size and symmetry of the encephalon is not sustained by facts; at least the exceptions to the rule are so many and so remarkable as to render it extremely misleading and therefore of little practical value as a scientific principle.

These can not be given within the limits of this article, and only the briefest and most generalized summary of the main features can be indicated. The largest weight of brain in the whole list is that of the Russian novelist Turgenieff, whose brain weighed, at the time of his death, at sixty-five years of age, 71 ounces.[32] It is a considerable step from him to the next in order, the English mechanician and author, Knight, whose brain weight at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> was 64 ounces.

You can see it in the distance with the tower surmounted by the national flag.

Sailing across in a south-easterly direction, you come to a famous old town--Vadstena. How times have changed! Before you rise the massive castle with its towers and spire. It was built by Gustavus Vasa, who when <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years of age brought here his third wife, Katarina Stenboch, who was only sixteen and a very unwilling bride. The lake comes up to the walls and fills the moat, which is used as a harbour. There are here remains of two churches, which owed their origin, as the town did, to a convent founded by S.

None of the inferior narcotic-stimulants is at all comparable with alcohol in the degree of its food-replacing power. We read that tobacco and coca will enable a man to go several days without anything to eat; and we interpret this result as due to the waste-retarding action of these substances. But when we find that alcohol will support life for weeks and months, we can no longer be content with such an explanation. When we recollect that Cornaro lived healthily for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years upon twelve ounces of light food and fourteen ounces of wine _per diem_,[20] and reflect upon the large proportion of alcoholic drink in this diet, the suspicion is forced upon us that alcohol is not only a true stimulant but also a true food.

The stalls and misericords of Christchurch, as we see them now, are a patchwork of portions of work of several periods framed together at some more or less recent epoch; there are at least two styles of Renaissance work, and three or more of Gothic. The earlier Renaissance work, which is seen in most of the misericords and on the stall backs is that of William Eyre who was Prior from 1502 to 1520 (2). There are <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> stalls; of the misericords twenty-six have been stolen or destroyed. The early date of this work makes it of exceptional importance in the history of the introduction of Renaissance art into England. One special feature of the work is the portrait panels. These also occur in a cupboard preserved in Louth church, Lincolnshire, where the panels have what look very much like portraits of Henry VII. and his queen, Elizabeth of York.

Thus in the early spring of 1805 (to me a memorable one, since in it I began my entomological career, and had anxiously watched its first approaches in order to study practically the science of which I had gained some theoretical knowledge in the winter,) insects were generally out by the middle of March; and before the 30th, I find, on referring to my entomological journal, that I had taken and investigated (I scarcely need add, not always with a correct result,) <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> coleopterous species: while in the last untoward spring (1816) I did not observe even a bee abroad until the 20th of April; and the first butterfly that I saw did not appear until the 26th. There are, however, circumstances connected with this reappearance, which seem to prove that something _more_ than the mere sensation of warmth is concerned in causing it.

The left hand is to begin with the fagott, sixteen feet, and the right hand on the choir with the \"sesquialtera.\" The piece was doubtless intended for the organ at Muehlhausen which was renovated and enlarged under Bach's directions, and which had three manuals, containing on one a sixteen feet \"fagott,\" and on another a combination producing a \"good sesquialtera tone.\" It is one of the larger choral-vorspiele, containing <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> bars. It is worth while noticing how Bach, in this, and all other choral-vorspiele, does not adhere literally to the notes of the melody, but introduces ornamental passages, or lengthens and shortens notes to serve his purpose, or introduces the subject in augmentation and diminution. This was the regular custom amongst German organists. The choral-vorspiel is, in its simplest form, merely intended to prepare the congregation for the melody that is to be sung, but instead...", "...ruined by the flood.' But the historian Ibn Wasifsha says, 'when Berdashir ruled--and he is the first who became a priest and who practised magic and used to render himself invisible--he sent the Prince Hermes to the great Lake,[27] whence the waters of the Nile flow.

He regulated and measured the quantity of water flowing out, so as to allow to flow out that amount which is required for...", "...often heard the cuckoo without money in my pocket, and have been sometimes reproached as fool-hardy for not turning down my eyes when a raven flew over my head.

Its body was embalmed and general mourning was observed.

Here in the gigantic sarcophagi, weighing about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> tons each, were discovered some of the remains of these animals. The chapels of the Serapeum were evidently places of pilgrimage, for many votive statues and stelae have been found there dedicated to the dead Apis, \"in hopes of thereby gaining his favour and the fulfilment of their various wishes.\" The Apis, though dead, was even yet more powerful, for his soul became joined to that of Osiris, and thus the dual god Osiris-Apis was formed, a name more familiar in the Grecian...", "...away with their barefaced depravity; and the people there told me that these atrocities were much practised by the denizens of the cloister, which term is simply another name for houses of ill-fame.

From the beginning this strange little creature, that lived in a society under complicated laws and executed prodigious labours in the darkness, attracted the notice of men.

But these dealt rather with the legend of the bee; and all that we can gather therefrom--which indeed is exceedingly little--we may find condensed in the fourth book of Virgil's Georgics. The real history of the bee begins in the seventeenth century, with the discoveries of the great Dutch savant Swammerdam.

Bonaparte received his own appointment as sub-lieutenant October 10, 1785. His was one of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> commissions which Louis XVI. signed for the Ecole Militaire. Eleven years later, November 15, 1796, Bonaparte, commander-in-chief of the army of Italy, at the Bridge of Arcola, which was defended by two regiments of Croats and two pieces of cannon, seeing his ranks disseminated by grapeshot and musket balls, feeling that victory was slipping through his fingers, alarmed by the hesitation of his bravest followers, wrenched the tri-color from the rigid fingers of a dead...", "...of his study: they are poems, poetic translations from the Italian, religious essays, and grammatical treatises. Indeed, the existence of all the friars at San Lazzaro is one of close and earnest study; and life grows so fond of these quiet monks that it will hardly part with them at last. One of them is ninety-five years old, and, until 1863, there was a lay-brother among them whose years numbered a hundred and eight, and who died of old age, on the 17th of September, after passing <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years at San Lazzaro. From biographic memoranda furnished me by Padre Giacomo, I learn that the name of this patriarch was George Karabagiak, and that he was a native of Kutaieh in Asia Minor. He was for a long time the disciple of Dede Vartabied, a renowned preacher of the Armenian faith, and he afterward taught the doctrines of his master in the Armenian schools. Failing in his desire to enter upon the sacerdotal life at Constantinople, he procured his admission as...", "...to his own chamber, and another to be removed from court; and that, after his Majesty's death, his body and head swelled above measure; his hair, with the skin of his head, stuck to his pillow, and his nails became loose on his fingers and toes.\" Clarendon, who, by the way, was a partisan of the Duke's, gives a totally different account of James's death. He says, \"It was occasioned by an ague (after a short indisposition by the gout) which, meeting many humours in a fat unwieldy body of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years old, in four or five fits carried him out of the world. After whose death many scandalous and libellous discourses were raised, without the least colour or ground; as appeared upon the strictest and most malicious examination that could be made, long after, in a time of licence, when nobody was afraid of offending majesty, and when prosecuting the highest reproaches and contumelies against the royal family was held very meritorious.\" Notwithstanding this confident...", "...he answers: 'No.' And if they ask: 'But how can you endure it?' he answers: 'I can endure it, for I love the hand that drags me.'

Once I got to know an old blind Lapp up in the hills. For <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years he had seen nothing, and now he was over seventy. It seemed to him that his sight was getting better little by little; getting on gradually, he thought. If all went well he would be able to make out the sun in a few years' time. His hair was still black, but his eyes were quite white. When we sat in his hut, smoking, he would tell of all the things he had seen before he went blind. He was hardy and strong; without feeling, indestructible; and he kept his hope. When I...", "...taking the passage of Don Cristoval, to reach the rocky island of Cayo de Piedras, and to clear the archipelago, which the Spanish pilots, in the early times of the conquest, designated by the names of Gardens and Bowers (Jardines y Jardinillos). The Queen's Gardens, properly so called, are nearer Cape Cruz, and are separated from the archipelago by an open sea thirty-five leagues broad. Columbus gave them the name they bear, in 1494, when, on his second voyage, he struggled during <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> days with the winds and currents between the island of Pinos and the eastern cape of Cuba. He describes the islands of this archipelago as verdant, full of trees and pleasant* (verdes, llenos de arboledas, y graciosos).

The bricks of this building were also brought from England. This town was the capital of tins State previous to its removal to Richmond. I walked nearly two miles to Fort Magruder, where I found a colored school of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> members, taught by Maggie Thorpe and Martha Haines, of New York, under the auspices of the Society of Friends. To accommodate men and women who could not leave their work during the day they opened a night school, and had fifty of that class.

A few miles further there was another school of thirty scholars who had made commendable...", "...to handle his work faster and without the costly process of \"smut-sheeting.\" He interested a local druggist who was something of a chemist and together they perfected a dryer that was quite satisfactory and the printer decided to market his product.

On the strength of this showing, his banker backed him for the cost of a hundred thousand letters and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> thousand orders were the result. The banker was interested in a large land company and believing the printer must be a veritable wizard in writing letters, made him an attractive offer to take charge of the advertising for the company's Minnesota and Canada lands. The man sold his business, accepted the position--and made a signal failure. He appealed to the printers because he knew their problems--the things that lost them money, the troubles that caused them...", "...Emperor Of The East.--Administration And Disgrace Of Eutropius.--Revolt Of Gainas.--Persecution Of St. John Chrysostom.--Theodosius II. Emperor Of The East.--His Sister Pulcheria.--His Wife Eudocia.--The Persian War, And Division Of Armenia. The division of the Roman world between the sons of Theodosius marks the final establishment of the empire of the East, which, from the reign of Arcadius to the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, subsisted one thousand and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years, in a state of premature and perpetual decay. The sovereign of that empire assumed, and obstinately retained, the vain, and at length fictitious, title of Emperor of the Romans; and the hereditary appellation of Caesar and Augustus continued to declare, that he was the legitimate successor of the first of men, who had reigned over the first of nations. The place of Constantinople rivalled, and perhaps excelled, the magnificence of Persia; and the eloquent sermons of...", "...resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia. Heraclea and Hadrianople might, perhaps, escape this dreadful irruption of the Huns; but the words, the most expressive of total extirpation and erasure, are applied to the calamities which they inflicted on seventy cities of the Eastern empire. [20] Theodosius, his court, and the unwarlike people, were protected by the walls of Constantinople; but those walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake, and the fall of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> towers had opened a large and tremendous breach. The damage indeed was speedily repaired; but this accident was aggravated by a superstitious fear, that Heaven itself had delivered the Imperial city to the shepherds of Scythia, who were strangers to the laws, the language, and the religion, of the Romans.

As I look back on it now, it seems more like some wonderful dream than a reality, wherein men strove with women and children for food to keep life in their own worthless bodies. It is enough if I say that of the four hundred and ninety persons whom Captain Smith left behind him, there were, in the month of May of the year 1610, but <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> left alive. That God should have spared among those, Nathaniel Peacock and myself, is something which passeth understanding, for verily there were scores of better than we whose lives would have advantaged Jamestown more than ours ever can, who died and were buried as best they could be by the few who had sufficient strength remaining to dig the graves. I set it down in all truth that, through God's mercy, our lives were saved by Master Hunt, for he counseled us wisely as...", "...forty-three by Titian, thirty-four by Tintoret, twenty-five by Paul Veronese. Rubens has the enormous contingent of sixty-four. Of Teniers, whose works are sold for fabulous sums for the square inch, this extraordinary museum possesses no less than sixty finished pictures,--the Louvre considers itself rich with fourteen. So much for a few of the foreigners. Among the Spaniards the three greatest names could alone fill a gallery. There are sixty-five Velazquez, forty-six Murillos, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> Riberas. Compare these figures with those of any other gallery in existence, and you will at once recognize the hopeless superiority of this collection. It is not only the greatest collection in the world, but the greatest that can ever be made until this is broken up. But with all this mass of wealth it is not a complete, nor, properly speaking, a representative museum. You cannot trace upon its walls the slow, groping progress of art towards perfection. It contains few...", "...The fetus was large and occupied the first position. Version was with difficulty effected and the passage of the after-coming head through the superior strait required expression and traction, during which the child died. The mother suffered a deep laceration of the perineum involving an inch of the wall of the rectum. Among others reporting instances of protracted pregnancy are Collins, eleven months; Desbrest, eighteen months; Henderson, fifteen months; Jefferies, three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> days, and De la Vergne gives the history of a woman who carried an infant in her womb for twenty-nine months; this case may possibly belong under the head of fetus long retained in the uterus. Unconscious Pregnancy.--There are numerous instances of women who have had experience in pregnancy unconsciously going almost to the moment of delivery, yet experiencing none of the usual accompanying symptoms of this condition. Crowell speaks of a woman of good social position who...", "...body between the genitals which they mistook for a prolapsed uterus. Early on April 2d, a few hours before interment, the men thought to examine the swelling they had seen the day before. A second look showed it to be a dead female child, now lying between the thighs and connected with the mother by the umbilical cord. The interment was stopped, and Mayer was called to examine the body, but with negative results, though the signs of death were not plainly visible for a woman dead <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> hours. By its development the body of the fetus confirmed the mother's account of a pregnancy of twenty-one weeks. Mayer satisfies himself at least that the mother was in a trance at the time of delivery and died soon afterward. Moritz gives the instance of a woman dying in pregnancy, undelivered, who happened to be disinterred several days after burial. The body was in an advanced state of decomposition, and a fetus was found in the coffin. It was supposed that the...", "...exposure. When he consulted Pancoast the horns had nearly all fallen off and were brought to the physician for inspection; and the photograph was taken after the patient had tied the horns in situ on his face. Anomalies of the Hair.--Congenital alopecia is quite rare, and it is seldom that we see instances of individuals who have been totally destitute of hair from birth. Danz knew of two adult sons of a Jewish family who never had hair or teeth. Sedgwick quotes the case of a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> who ever since birth was totally devoid of hair and in whom sensible perspiration and tears were absent. A cousin on his mother's side, born a year before him, had precisely the same peculiarity. Buffon says that the Turks and some other people practised depilatory customs by the aid of ointments and pomades, principally about the genitals. Atkinson exhibited in Philadelphia a man of forty who never had any distinct growth of hair since birth, was edentulous, and destitute...", "...of almost colorless urine. Dickinson mentions that he has had patients in his own practice who drank their own urine. Mackenzie also quotes Trousseau's history of a man who drank a liter of strong French brandy in two hours, and habitually drank the same quantity daily. He stated that he was free from the effects of alcohol; on several occasions on a wager he took 20 liters of wine, gaining his wager without visibly affecting his nervous system. There is an instance of a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> who could not live through the night without a pail of water, although his health was otherwise good. Atkinson in 1856 reported a young man who in childhood was a dirt-eater, though at that time complaining of nothing but excessive thirst. He was active, industrious, enjoyed good health, and was not addicted to alcoholics. His daily ration of water was from eight to twelve gallons. He always placed a tub of water by his bed at night, but this sometimes proved insufficient....", "...for eight years. According to Jonston, Hermolus lived forty years on air alone. This same author has also collected cases of abstinence lasting eleven, twenty-two, and thirty years and cites Aristotle as an authority in substantiating his instances of fasting girls. Wadd, the celebrated authority on corpulence, quotes Pennant in mentioning a woman in Rosshire who lived one and three-quarters years without meat or drink. Granger had under observation a woman by the name of Ann Moore, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years of age, who fasted for two years. Fabricius Hildanus relates of Apollonia Schreiera that she lived three years without meat or drink. He also tells of Eva Flegen, who began to fast in 1596, and from that time on for sixteen years, lived without meat or drink. According to the Rev. Thos. Steill, Janet Young fasted sixteen years and partially prolonged her abstinence for fifty years. The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, which contains a mention of the foregoing...", "...living on water and chewing apples, but spitting out the pulp; at the expiration of this time he died. Eccles relates the history of a beautiful young woman of sixteen, who upon the death of a most indulgent father refused food for thirty-four days, and soon afterward for fifty-four days, losing all her senses but that of touch. There is an account of a French adventurer, the Chevalier de Saint-Lubin, who had a loathing for food and abstained from every kind of meat and drink for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> days. Saint-Sauver, at that time Lieutenant of the Bastille, put a close watch on this man and certified to the verity of the fast. The European Magazine in 1783 contained an account of the Calabria earthquake, at which time a girl of eighteen was buried under ruins for six days. The edge of a barrel fell on her ankle and partly separated it, the dust and mortar effectually stopping the hemorrhage. The foot dropped off and the wound healed without medical assistance, the...", "...of a bee above the eyebrow followed by death. Zacutus saw a bee-sting which was followed by gangrene. Delaistre mentions death from a hornet-sting in the palate. Nivison relates the case of a farmer of fifty who was stung in the neck by a bee. The usual swelling and discoloration did not follow, but notwithstanding vigorous medical treatment the man died in six days. Thompson relates three cases of bee-sting, in all of which death supervened within fifteen minutes,--one in a farmer of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> who was stung in the neck below the right ear; a second in an inn-keeper of fifty who was stung in the neck, and a third of a woman of sixty-four who was stung on the left brow. \"Chirurgus\" recalls the details of a case of a wasp-sting in the middle finger of the right hand of a man of forty, depriving him of all sense and of muscular power.

One of his particular graces was the air and manner (imitated, no doubt, from Mole) with which he took snuff from a gold box adorned with the portrait of the Princess Goritza,--a charming Hungarian, celebrated for her beauty in the last years of the reign of Louis XV. Having been attached during his youth to that illustrious stranger, he still mentioned her with emotion. For her sake he had fought a duel with Monsieur de Lauzun. The chevalier, now <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years of age, owned to only fifty; and he might well allow himself that innocent deception, for, among the other advantages granted to fair thin persons, he managed to preserve the still youthful figure which saves men as well as women from an appearance of old age. Yes, remember this: all of life, or rather all the elegance that expresses life, is in the figure. Among the chevalier's other possessions must be counted an enormous nose with which nature had endowed him. This...", "...early days when the place was a rendezvous of the trappers, a large buffalo-robe press was erected.

By barometrical measurements taken by the engineer officers of the army at different times, the height of Bent's Fort above the ocean level is approximately eight thousand nine hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> feet, and the fall of the Arkansas River from the fort to the great bend of that stream, about three hundred and eleven miles east, is seven feet and four-tenths per mile.

The town of Hillsborough, in 1829, gave Franklin Pierce his first public honor, by electing him its representative in the legislature of the state. His whole service in that body comprised four years, in the two latter of which he was elected Speaker by a vote of one hundred and fifty-five against <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> for other candidates. This overpowering majority evinced the confidence which his character inspired, and which, during his whole career, it has invariably commanded, in advance of what might be termed positive proof, although the result has never failed to justify it.

He was, however, one of the best botanists in the County and his little book on \"Glebshire Ferns\" is, I believe, an authority in its own line. Archdeacon Brandon was, of course, greatly helped by his magnificent physical presence. \"Magnificent\" is not, I think, too strong a word. Six feet two or three in height, he had the figure of an athlete, light blue eyes, and his hair was still, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years of age, thick and fair and curly like that of a boy. He looked, indeed, marvellously young, and his energy and grace of movement might indeed have belonged to a youth still in his teens.

Many of the Polchester ladies thought that he was like \"a Greek God\" (the fact that they had never seen one gave them the greater confidence), and Miss Dobell, who was the best read of...", "...all that he did and his wisdom: behold they are all written in the book of the words of the days of Solomon.

In those sixteen years she had received one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> thousand letters: she kept three stenographers busy, and the number of girls who to-day bless the name of Ruth Ashmore is legion.

This total is made up of $20,000,000 spent by San Francisco and California, $10,000,000 laid out in state and foreign buildings and displays, $10,000,000 by private exhibitors, and $10,000,000 by the one hundred concessionaires on the Joy Zone. San Francisco contributed $12,500,000, the State of California $5,000,000, and its <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> counties, $2,500,000. The amounts expended by foreign nations range from $1,700,000 by Argentina to sums as low as $100,000. The State of New York spent nearly $1,000,000. II.

The Bank's paper fell from 4 to 6 per cent., and it was in such demand that the Bank of England took it at 2 to 3 per cent. discount. But finally the market had all that it could take. The attention of merchants was attracted to Mr. Biddle's gigantic speculations, who paid paper in America and collected hard money in London. Business interests complained about the contraction in the market. The Bank's stock of cotton increased steadily, and between June and July it rose from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> to ninety million bales. This speculation had already yielded $15,000,000 profit, but the market was overloaded, and quotations could not keep up. The planters had made a great deal by the advance in cotton, but the paper money remitted them lost from 15 to 25 per cent. A panic was approaching. The cotton crop, amounting to 400,000 bales, was one fifth less than was expected; they awaited an advance in price, but the contrary occurred.

The term 'good reading' is relative, and must vary according to the taste of each reader, and it is just this variety of standards that seems to present an unsurmountable obstacle to any general and comprehensive system of suggestions.\" Miss Bullard, of the Seymour Library, Auburn, N. Y., reports a decrease in fiction from sixty-five (65) to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> (58) per cent in the last five years. She says: \"I have endeavored, year by year, to gain the confidence of the younger portion of our subscribers in my ability to always furnish them with interesting reading, and have thus been able to turn them from the domain of fiction into the more useful fields of literature. Another noticeable and encouraging feature of the library is the increasing use made of it by pupils in the high school in connection with school-work.\" Mr....", "...up comes your head and shoulders into sight; then sez I, It's a man, sure, but where is his boat? for you see, I couldn't see your boat, it was so low down in the water. Then I reckoned it was a man afloating on a log, but arter a while the boat loomed up too, and I says, I'll be dog-goned if that isn't him. I went up to Newbern, some time ago, in the schooner, and the people there said there was a man coming down the coast a-rowing a paper boat on a bet. The boat weighed only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> pounds, and the man had a heft of only eighty pounds. When pa and me went up to the city agin, the folks said the man was close on to us, and this time they said the man and his boat together weighed only eighty pounds. Now I should think you weighed more than that yourself, letting alone the boat.\" Having assured the young man that I was indeed myself, and that the Newbern people had played upon his credulity, we walked on to the house, where the family of Captain...", "...under heaven.\" Notwithstanding the enormous cost of the Bible as translated by Wyclif,--L2, 16s. 8d., a sum probably equal to thirty pounds, or one hundred and fifty dollars of our present money, more than half the annual income of a substantial yeoman,--still it was copied and circulated with remarkable rapidity. Neither the cost of the valuable manuscript nor the opposition and vigilance of an almost omnipresent inquisition were able to suppress it. Wyclif was now about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> years of age. He had rendered a transcendent service to the English nation, and a service that not one of his contemporaries could have performed,--to which only the foremost scholar and theologian of his day was equal. After such a work he might have reposed in his quiet parish in genial rest, conscious that he had opened a new era in the history of his country. But rest was not for him. He now appears as a doctrinal controversialist. Hitherto his attacks had been...", "...days were luxurious and honored. At fifty-one he gave up his public duties as a collector of customs, chiefly on wool, and retired to Woodstock and spent the remainder of his fortunate life in dignified leisure and literary labors. In addition to his revenues, the Duke of Lancaster, who was virtually the ruler of the land during the reign of Richard II., gave him the castle of Donnington, with its park and gardens; so that he became a man of territorial influence. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-eight</span> he removed to London, and took a house in the precincts of Westminster Abbey, where the chapel of Henry VII. now stands. He died the following year, and was buried in the Abbey church,--that sepulchre of princes and bishops and abbots. His body was deposited in the place now known as the Poets' Corner, and a fitting monument to his genius was erected over his remains, as the first great poet that had appeared in England, probably only surpassed in genius by Shakspeare,...", "...A.
