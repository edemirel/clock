My birds were flying up the river at a good height. The brown pelicans, on the other hand, made their daily pilgrimages <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> above the level of the water, as has been already described, and were never over the river, but off the beach.

Such an end can only be insisted upon. The failure that results from its lack of adaptation is attributed simply to the perverseness of conditions, not to the fact that the end is not reasonable under the circumstances. The value of a legitimate aim, on the contrary, lies in the fact that we can use it to change conditions. It is a method for dealing with conditions so as to effect desirable alterations in them. A farmer who should passively accept things <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as he finds them would make as great a mistake as he who framed his plans in complete disregard of what soil, climate, etc., permit. One of the evils of an abstract or remote external aim in education is that its very inapplicability in practice is likely to react into a haphazard snatching at immediate conditions. A good aim surveys the present state of experience of pupils, and forming a tentative plan of treatment, keeps the plan constantly in view and yet modifies it as...", "...in the former kind of knowledge we are generally obliged to proceed from the effect to the cause. In other respects, the law of causality, or the principle of sufficient reason of change, which guides empirical knowledge, is in itself just as certain as the other forms of the principle of sufficient reason which are followed by the _a priori_ sciences referred to above. Logical demonstrations from concepts or syllogisms have the advantage of proceeding from the reason to the consequent, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as much as knowledge through perception _a priori_, and therefore in themselves, _i.e._, according to their form, they are infallible. This has greatly assisted to bring demonstration in general into such esteem.

The Middlemount House had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> been organized on the scale of a first class hotel, with prices that had risen a little in anticipation of the other improvements. The landlord had hitherto united in himself the functions of clerk and head waiter, but he had now got a senior, who was working his way through college, to take charge of the dining-room, and had put in the office a youth of a year's experience as under clerk at a city hotel.

In most savage societies no sharp line seems to be drawn between the two kinds of taboo <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> indicated, and even in more advanced nations the notions of holiness and uncleanness often touch.

It looked like a terrible alternative to the owner, so overburdened with anxiety for the safety of his daughter; but he was prepared to run even this risk for her sake. The method of getting into the bay had been fully considered by the owner and the captain; and as...", "...of them's been out, madam, and have got appetites like young troopers,\" said Nancy evasively. Terry listened with the keenest disappointment. Was Nancy not going to tell Granny that it was she, Terry, who had got her that egg for her breakfast? When the nursery meal appeared, Terry rushed forth her grievance. \"Oh, Nursey, you never told Granny who got her that egg! And after all the trouble I took!\" \"The trouble you took was all boldness and disobedience,\" said Nancy, \"and it's <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> the way you're to be punished by not letting her know. It isn't to screen you that I'm not tellin' her the whole of your conduct, but only just that I won't have her sick about it. It wasn't you at all that got the eggs, but Misther Reilly; for there you were stuck in the dyke, with the pony hurted, an you as far off as to-morrow from Connolly's farm.\" \"It's a worse punishment than if you beat me,\" said Terry. \"And you said I had an appetite like a trooper, and I haven't, for I...", "...carried, no doubt can be entertained that the annual gains must be immense.--It has, indeed, been stated, with an appearance of truth, that a single individual acquired no less than L.60,000 during one English Lottery!

Nearer and nearer came the doomed man. Now I heard him halt before me. There was a muttered exclamation, and then a step as he came to my side. I felt him kneel beside me. My grip tightened upon the chain. He leaned close to me. I must open my eyes to find his throat, grasp it, and strike one mighty final blow all at the same instant. The thing worked <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as I had planned. So brief was the interval between the opening of my eyes and the fall of the chain that I could not check it, though in that minute interval I recognized the face so close to mine as that of my son, Carthoris.

What devious chain of circumstances had led my boy to my side at this one particular minute of our lives when I could strike him down and kill him, in ignorance of his identity!

He dashed madly towards her, stooped to snatch her weapon, a rook-rifle, from her, and swinging it high in the air, flung it back among the bushes and bracken he had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> crossed. \"Are you mad!\" he cried. But there was no response. The girl had fallen back in a swoon, and a twitching of her fingers showed that even now her half-conscious mind was busy trying to find the trigger of the deadly rook-rifle. A rapid examination revealed the fact that she was quite uninjured, and concluding that she could be safely left where she was for a few minutes, he ran off again in the direction of the wounded or murdered man. * *...", "...accessory.

Different things.\" \"What things?\" \"Oh, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> sumpthing.

Next morning, Gert Botha's son Andries shot him. Maliwe received his twenty-five lashes, and was discharged from prison, after his back had, under the superintendence of the District Surgeon, been well washed with brine, to prevent evil results. Neither under the flogging nor the pickling did Maliwe exhibit the slightest sign of the torture which he suffered. On the same evening Maliwe went to a certain tree, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> at the back of old Dalisile's huts, and gave a long, low whistle, which was the established signal between himself and Nalai. Unfortunately, however, Nalai did not hear him, but her two big brothers, Kawana and Joli, did. Old Dalisile, anticipating Maliwe's visit, had kept Nalai out of the way, and put his two sons to watch. These fell upon Maliwe and smote him so hard with their kerries, that he lay for a long time senseless on the ground.

The same enactment might declare the soldiers of our native army liable to the same punishments for the same offences. Such an enactment would excite no discontent among our native soldiery; on the contrary, it would be applauded as <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> and proper. [W. H.

The present law is thus stated by Sir Edwin Collen: 'A \"summary court martial\"... may pass any sentence allowed by the articles of war, except . . . and may carry it out at once.

These weapons, designed especially for shooting straight up and sending shrapnel shells to a considerable height, were rapidly manned and fired by crews that seemed to be in readiness for <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> such danger. The raid of the French and American airships, quickly as the defensive preparations were made, seemed to take the Germans by surprise. That is the only way the boys could account for the fact that their guarding escort deserted them. For deserted they had been, some of the Germans running back in the direction whence Blake and the others had come, while a few, under orders from one of the German officers, helped to man the guns of which several score were now...", "......\" He shrugged. \"You mean that then we couldn't get out at all?\" she asked sharply. He looked down on her thoughtfully. \"I don't know,\" he replied slowly, \"whether you could make it then or not. I am more or less used to this sort of thing and you are not.

Now, senor, we leave you to enjoy your coffee and perform your toilet. His reverence, Pere Delormais, sends you his greeting and hopes you have slept.

If he had another, he told himself sourly, he wouldn't dare put stock in it. When girls horned in on coon hunts anything could happen and it probably would. Harky comforted himself with thoughts of what can happen on coon hunts. He had a soul-satisfying vision of a cold, wet, mud-spattered, and hungry Melinda wandering through the night pleading for Harky to come to her succor. Harky heard, but he let her wander until the last possible second. Then, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as she was about to sink into mud from which she would never rise had it not been for valiant Harky, he lifted her to her feet, took her home, and scuffed scornful feet on Mellie Garson's threshold. \"There!\" he heard himself saying. \"Let that teach you that girls ought never horn in on coon hunts!\" Harky breathed a doleful sigh. Delightful as this mental image was, in no way did it erase the fact that a girl had horned in on a coon hunt. Harky sought solace by tearing his...", "...but from the Rev. Edwin Hatch, D.

But we are satisfied to rest the case on orthodox admissions alone. The strongest argument then of clergymen who have attempted an answer to our position is something like this: Jesus is historical because a man by the name of Paul says so, though we do not know much about Paul. It is <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> such evidence as the above that led Prof. Goldwin Smith to exclaim: \"Jesus has flown. I believe the legend of Jesus was made by many minds working under a great religious impulse--one man adding a parable, another an exhortation, another a miracle story;\"--and George Eliot to write: \"The materials for a real life of Christ do not exist.\" In the effort to untie the Jesus-knot by Paul, the church has increased the number of knots to two. In other words, the church has proceeded...", "...pleaded ever more faintly and piteously until Harry, halting abruptly, without a word grimly gave him half a dozen swallows; and when they resumed, Terry had decided that he'd rather have a drink, himself, than all the gold of Pike's Peak.

Sextus Pompeius, in his expedition into Asia, touched at the isle of Cea in Negropont: it happened whilst he was there, as we have it from one that was with him, that a woman of great quality, having given an account to her citizens why she was resolved to put an end to her life, invited Pompeius to her death, to render it the more honourable, an invitation that...", "...and his smiling flow of chatter about nothing came to a pause. \"There is something I want very much to ask you about,\" she went on, \"something I want your help in.\" \"I am at your orders,\" said Pateley, with a smile and bow that concealed his surprise. \"It is something that matters very, very much,\" Rachel went on. \"Something you could find out for me.\" Pateley said nothing. \"I don't know if you know,\" she went on hurriedly--\"if you heard, of what happened to me in London <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> before my father died?

And since, I have not been able to remember anything of what happened during those days.\" Pateley made a sort of sympathetic sound and gesture. \"But,\" Rachel said, \"I have heard to-day--not until to-day--of...", "...next governor of Kansas, I understand!\" Henry indicated his feeling about the Ritz thus: The night we arrived he failed, for the first time in two weeks, to demand a dress rehearsal in our $17.93 uniforms from 43rd Street in New York. The gold braided uniforms that we saw in the corridors of the Ritz that night made us pause and consider many things. When we unpacked our valises, there were the little bundles just as they had come from 43rd Street. Henry tucked his away with a sigh, and <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> before he went to sleep he called across the widening spaces between sleep and wakening: \"I suppose we might have bought that $23.78 outfit, easy enough!\" It was in the morning that the veneer of the Ritz began to wear off for Henry.

And since last night he had known that Collingwood had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> been called to the Bar, and was on the threshold of what Eldrick, who evidently knew all about it, believed to be a promising career. Well, there he was in the flesh; and Pratt, who was a born observer of men and events, took a good look at him as he stood just within the private room, talking to Eldrick. A good-looking fellow; what most folk would call handsome; dark, clean-shaven, tall, with a certain air of reserve about his well-cut features, firm lips, and steady eyes that...", "...which he would suffer no one but Corrie to take to him.\" \"Poor Gascoyne! I will go and relieve his mind,\" said Henry, turning to quit the quarter-deck. Now, the noise created by the meeting of the two vessels had aroused Gascoyne from the lethargic state of mind and body to which he had given way. Coming on deck, he was amazed to find himself close to the Talisman. A boat lay alongside the Foam, into which he jumped, and, sculling towards the frigate, he stepped over the bulwarks <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as Henry turned to go in search of him. The pirate captain's face wore a haggard, careworn, humbled look, that was very different from its usual bold, lion-like expression. No one can tell what a storm had passed through the strong man's breast while he lay alone on the floor of his cabin,--the deep, deep sorrow; the remorse for sin; the bitterness of soul, when he reflected that his present misery was chargeable only to himself. A few nights had given him the aspect of a much...", "...of the drizzly rain which is produced by the foam of the water, they had by no means so fine a prospect from below as they anticipated. On this account, therefore, they soon again ascended and satisfied themselves by looking from above upon this sublime and majestic sight.

There was another party <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> arrived from New-York, to render homage to this great natural curiosity. In company with these gentlemen and ladies, they took a walk to Goat-Island, by a convenient wooden bridge, thrown over the rapids about seven years since. The first bridge leads to a small island called Bath-Island, which contains a bath-house; the second to Goat-Island, which is about one mile in circumference, and overgrown with old and beautiful trees. On Bath-Island a person may approach so near the...", "...warm. It was while they were jumpin' and shovin' each other about over the graves that they noticed that the top stone of a great flat old grave was loose, and, of course, they started to make it looser by see-sawing it, until one fat boy jumped it a bit too 'eavy, and it tilted and let him in.\" \"In where?\" I asked quickly. \"Into a new-made grave, sir,\" he answered solemnly--\"a grave what had been dug recently under the old stone.\" \"Whatever for?\" asked Don Juan. \"That's <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> where it is,\" replied the officer; \"that's just what we want to find out. The grave is about half filled in with loose earth. We want to know what's under that loose earth, and that's why I'm here.\" \"What have we got to do with it?\" asked the Don. \"The theory is, sir,\" replied Bull, \"that _something_ is buried under that loose earth. It may be stolen property. It may be a _body_.\" I think both Don Juan and I whitened at the prospect disclosed by the inspector, but the Don...", "...so disgraceful an act!' and then flounced out of the room.\" \"_What_ a pair!\" exclaimed Mrs. Winslow. \"He thought I was just perfectly splendid after that; kept coming and coming, indorsed me publicly, got wild over me; but I held him at arm's length for months, until I thought the man would really go crazy; and finally--well, you know I told you Daddy was an 'accommodation husband,' and if he hadn't been one after I had tripped up one of the richest men in all England, I would have <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> hired somebody to have dumped him into the Thames, sure!\" The sparkling flow of Miss Gray's experience was here interrupted by Mrs. Winslow's ordering another bottle of wine, and after the couple had partaken of the same, the spicy narrative was continued: \"But now comes the fun, Winslow.

Had any one told me, then, that it would be Judaism, I should have either laughed or been insulted. For I was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as much afraid as ever of what hardships my religion might work for me at college. I had as much fear, as much abhorrence of the truth, in that regard. I wanted so much to forget it--to be one of the other sort, little caring for creed in any form, but wishing I were safe in the comfort of having been born into the faith of the majority. As I looked at it then, I was going into these new four years with a tremendous handicap scored against me. It seemed so unfair: I cared so...", "...same age as her husband; oh, it is too frightening! Just think!

The name of king applies to them less on account of the size of their fortune than the generous use they make of it. They have founded hospitals, museums, and libraries, and are known for the generosity with which they respond to appeals for help in philanthropical causes. Shortly before my arrival in America, Mr. Vanderbilt had given 500,000 dollars to found a hospital in New York. Mrs. Astor had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> given 225,000 dollars towards the funds of the Cancer Hospital. The Vanderbilt mansion, in Fifth Avenue, New York, is a princely habitation.

Loft glanced at the clock. \"The men will <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> be at their tea, miss,\" he said. It was now about half-past four. \"It'll do in half an hour's time,\" she answered. \"But let it get there this afternoon without fail.\" As Loft went out, she turned to me. \"There now, that's settled.\" Was it? There was still to-night. I suspected to-night desperately. I suspected Jenny's love of having it both ways to the very last moment that she could. I suspected the strength of the lure toward Octon. Whether she divined my suspicions I...", "...for want of proper care? I never heard of such a thing. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\" And then all the Ducks broke out in chorus. \"'Ow, I s'y, 'ere's an old party come to teach us 'ow to bring up our chicks,\" said one. \"Shall I just step out and teach your little feller 'ow to run?\" said another. \"Look out, little 'un, or your 'orns will drop off,\" said a third; and this annoyed the Pricket very much, for how could his horns be dropping off, considering that they were only <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> clean of velvet? \"The old 'un hasn't got no 'orns,\" said a fourth; \"there's an old Cow in the next field. Shall I go and borrow a pair for you, mum? She'll be 'appy to lend 'em, I'm sure.\" And they all burst out laughing together, \"Quar, quar, quar, quar!\" And I am sorry to say that the Ducks laughed even louder than the Mallards. Altogether they were so rude, and impudent, and vulgar, and odious, that the Deer walked away with great dignity without saying another word. And as...", "...acknowledge my young legal friend's bow in--what may seem to him--a very short, sharp manner; and modestly refrain from helping him by saying a word to begin the conversation. He is, perhaps, unreasonably disconcerted by this, and therefore starts the talk weakly by saying that it is a fine day. \"Fine!\" exclaims Miss Martha, with a look of amazement at her sister. \"Fine!\" with a stare of perplexity at my young legal friend. \"Dear me! what do you mean, now, by a fine day?\" \"We were <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> saying how cold it was,\" says Miss Barbara. \"And how very like rain,\" says Miss Charlotte, with a look at the white clouds outside, which happen to be obscuring the sun for a few minutes. \"But what do you mean, now, by a fine day?\" persists Miss Martha. My young legal friend is put on his mettle by this time, and answers with professional readiness: \"At this uncertain spring season, my definition of a fine day, is a day on which you do not feel the want of your great-coat,...", "...come to-morrow, if you like,\" said Hester. \"Well, dear, well--that must be as Mrs Willis thinks best. Ah, here we are at Sefton at last. We shall look out for you in church on Sunday, my love.\" CHAPTER THREE. AT LAVENDER HOUSE. Hester's journey had really proved wonderfully agreeable. She had taken a great fancy to the little old ladies who had fussed over her and made themselves pleasant in her behalf. She felt herself something like a heroine as she poured out a little, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> a little, of her troubles into their sympathising ears; and their cheerful remarks with regard to school and school-life had caused her to see clearly that there might be another and a brighter side to the gloomy picture she had drawn with regard to her future. But during the drive of two and a half miles from Sefton to Lavender House, Hester once more began to feel anxious and troubled. The Misses Bruce had gone off with some other passengers in a little omnibus to their...", "...be tender of her surely. \"We'll all go--won't we--to heaven? The singin' was so beautiful.

Oh, do not be afraid, God will care for you.\" \"I don't seem to understand 'bout God,\" and there was a great, strange awe in Dil's eyes. \"But you've been lovely. I can understand that.\" One more glance at Bess, whose face was lighted with an exalted glow, as if she were poised, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> ready for flight. Oh, what could comfort Dil when she was gone? And _he_ had so much! He was so rich in home and love. A woman stood in the lower hallway, the half-despairing face he had noted. She clutched his arm. \"See here,\" she cried. \"You said, 'deliver us from evil.' Is anybody--is God strong enough to do it? From horrible evil--when there seems no other way open--when you must see some one you love--die starvin'--an' no work to be had--O my God!\" The cry pierced...", "...just now, and if you will tell me the nature of your business--\" Instead, she had surprising, delightful, convincing things for Mr. Truax to be doing, just at that particular _moment_-- From Mr. Truax himself she learned new ways of delicately getting rid of people.

He even practised such play-acting as putting on his hat and coat and rushing out to greet an important but unwelcome caller with, \"Oh, I'm so sorry I'm just going out--late f' important engagement--given m' secretary full instructions, and I know she'll take care of you jus' as well as I could personally,\" and returning to his private office by a rear door. Mr. Truax, like Mr. S. Herbert Ross, gave Una maxims. But his had very little to do...", "...And the lanterns and voices faded away forward. Norton lay very still for a few moments trying to realize it all. Then raising himself on one elbow, he peered out across an absolutely level open prairie. A waning moon hung low in the west, its thin radiance brooding above the plains like a mist, but the light was sufficient to reveal some half-dozen tepees, that lifted their smoky tops and tent poles not three hundred yards from the railway track. Norton looked at his watch. He could <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> make out that it was two o'clock in the morning. Could he _ever_ wait until daylight? So he asked himself over and over again, while his head (with its big mop of hair that _would_ curl in spite of the hours he spent in trying to brush it straight) snuggled down among the pillows, and his grave young eyes blinked longingly at those coveted tepees. And the next thing he knew a face was thrust between his berth-curtains, a thin, handsome, clean-shaven face, adorned with gold-rimmed...", "...Burnett's reputation would be ruined. An hour before the lecture was to begin found Migwan sitting in the parlor of the hotel waiting for Dr. Burnett to come down in answer to the note she sent up with a bellboy. He came presently, a long-haired, Van Dyke-y sort of man, who smiled genially at her and inquired affably what he could do for the charming miss. \"If you please,\" said Migwan breathlessly, \"could you give some other lecture just as well?\" \"Could I give some other lecture <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as well?\" repeated Dr. Burnett in perplexity. \"Yes,\" Migwan went on desperately, trying to get it over with quickly, \"could you?

You've got to wind it by means of a donkey engine. It's quite simple.\" \"I should think it would be,\" said Sypher drily. \"But I'll only take on the guns <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> for the present.\" He drew a check book from one pocket and a fountain pen from another. \"I'll advance you two hundred pounds for the sole right to deal with the thing on your behalf.

Englishmen had only just begun to learn the tricks and wiles of Spanish diplomacy, the smiles which hide antagonisms, the suave words which disguise impulsive thoughts. Lord Everingham had not wholly assimilated the lesson. He had frowned impatiently when the question of the marriage of his queen had been broached by the foreigner. It was a matter which roused the temper of every loyal Englishman <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> then; they would _not_ see Mary Tudor wedded to a stranger. England was beginning to feel her own independence; her children would not see her under another yoke. Mary, in spite of her Spanish mother, was English to the backbone. Tudor-like, she had proved her grit and her pluck when opposing factions tried to wrest her crown from her. She was Harry's daughter. Her loyal subjects were proud of her and proud of her descent, and many of them had sworn that none but an English...", "...Of course the matter of being clean is more or less a comparative condition, and what one nation or one family considers clean another nation or family might not be satisfied with at all. But judged by any standards I have happened to meet heretofore I should say the Arab quarter of Algiers was not overclean. But it was picturesque. In whatever direction you looked was a picture. It was like nature untouched by civilization--it could not be unpicturesque if it tried. It was, in fact, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> that--nature unspoiled by what we choose to call civilization because it means bustle, responsibility, office hours, and, now and then, clean clothes. And being nature, even the dirt was not unbeautiful. Somebody has defined dirt as matter out of place. It was not out of place here. Nor rags. Some of these creatures were literally a mass of rags--rag upon rag--sewed on, tacked on, tied on, hung on--but they were fascinating.

While our author is catholic in his reading, he does not seem to assign to all writers in his field their <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> value.

And it was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> ahead of her. It rang ominously in her ears at such an hour, and in such a place. She listened. Who could be in those woods at that hour of the night? Who beside herself? The voice was so distinct that she felt it must be very, very near. Then she remembered how the woods echo, particularly at night, and a shiver of fear swept over her at the thought that perhaps the sound of her own footsteps had reached the ears of the owner of the voice. She had no desire to encounter any...", "...at the words. \"Going to desert me?

Not just now.\" McTaggart's face was eloquent. \"All right,\" said Roddy with happy unconcern. \"You <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> tell me when you feel like it.\" The car trundled out between the narrow posts, and, avoiding the crowd, turned to the right; then, as the road, devoid of life, stretched straight ahead, took on speed. The noisy music faded away into darkness and silence and the rustling breeze. McTaggart drowsily closed his eyes, as the stars began to peer out of the heavens. His head sank lower, his thoughts became involved ... Then with a flash he came back to life. Awoke to find the...", "...It was no use my telling her that I always travelled on foot, and hated a 'Diligence;' she coolly replied that at our time of life we could not spare the time necessary for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, for so she supposed the journey from Lyons to Paris to be; so fearing lest any doubt might be thrown upon the ardour of my attachment, I yielded at once, remembering at the moment what my poor friend Tom Bing--Oh Lord, I'm at it again!\" \"Sir, I did not hear.\" \"Nothing, ma'am, I was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> going to observe, that ladies of a certain time of life, and widows especially, like a lover that seems a little ardent or so, all the better.\" Here Mrs. Bingham blushed, her daughter bridled, and I nearly suffocated with shame and suppressed laughter. \"After a most tender farewell of my bride or wife, I don't know which, I retired for the night with a mind vacillating between my hopes of happiness and my fears for the result of a journey so foreign to all my habits of...", "...pistol-shot and a scream.

Through this Gap come strange people and strange tales from the Kentucky hills. Over it, sometimes, is the span of a rainbow.

He was at an angle but when it hit him, it seemed to have just lodged--it seemed as if he were hung up on a seat button or something like that.

There was flesh particles that flew out of the side of his head in my direction from where I was standing, so much so that it indicated to me that the shot came out of the left side of his head.

She was a dear, nervous, old lady, who had never had any daughters of her own, and had rather a hazy notion of girls in general, and was indeed a little frightened of schoolgirls; but she tried to be very kind to her great-nieces, and had told Jessop to be sure and look after them. Jessop did not need any telling. It was she who had arranged their bedroom, and had put the little table in the window, and the two...", "...ever heard, for it came from the lips of her boy. He was in sight, coming along the well worn path that led in front of the other dwellings and to her own door. When he saw her, he waved his hand in salutation, but could not afford to break in on the vigorous melody which kept his lips puckered. She saw he was carrying something on his shoulder. A second glance showed that it was one of the heavy rifles used by the pioneers a hundred years ago. The sight--taken with what Omas had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> said--filled her heart with forebodings. She waited until the lad came up. He kissed her affectionately, and then in the offhand manner of a big boy, let the butt of the gun drop on the ground, leaned the top away from him, and glancing from it to his mother, asked--\"What do you think of it?\" \"It seems to be a good gun. Whose is it?\" \"Mine,\" was the proud response. \"Colonel Butler ordered that it be given to me, and I'm to use it, too, mother.\" \"For what purpose?\"...", "...your hands? They could not have been among my mother's effects.\" \"Are you aware,\" replied Sir Lucius, \"that on the night after your mother's death her house in Bayswater was broken into by a burglar?\" \"Yes; I remember that.\" \"Well, the burglar carried off, among other things that were of little value, this packet of papers. He concealed them at his lodgings in Kentish Town, and he chose a curious and ingenious hiding-place--a recess behind a loose brick in the wall of the house, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> below his window. Shortly afterward the rascal--his name was Noah Hawker--was caught at another crime, and sent to penal servitude for a term of years. On his release last spring, on ticket-of-leave, he went abroad, and when he returned to England several weeks ago he resurrected the papers from their place of security, studied them, and saw an opportunity for gain. He knew that they concerned three persons--you, Victor Nevill and myself--and he was cunning enough to start with...", "...grey for your wings, and a brown hackle, with a dark rather than a straw-coloured body, is the kind of fly we find most killing on the upper Coln. Of course it may be different on other streams, but I suspect there is a tendency to use too light a fly everywhere, save among those who have learnt by experience how to catch trout. As Sir Herbert Maxwell has proved by experiment, trout have no perception of colour except so far as the fly is light or dark. He found dark blue and red flies <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as killing as the ordinary may-fly. For the dry-fly fisherman equipment is half the battle. Show me the man who catches fish; ten to one his rod is well balanced and strong, his line heavy, though tapered, and his gut well selected and stained. The fly-book stamps the fisherman even more truly than the topboot stamps the fox-hunter. Nor does the accomplished expert with the dry fly disdain with fat of deer to grease his line, nor with paraffin to dress his fly and make it float....", "...He'll help.\" \"Mr. Arkwright? You say he's there? Then I won't--Yes, I will, too.\" Billy spoke with renewed firmness. \"I'll be there right away. Good-by.\" And she hung up the receiver, and went to tell Pete to order John and Peggy at once. \"I suppose I ought to have left Alice and Mr. Arkwright alone together,\" muttered the young wife feverishly, as she hurriedly prepared for departure. \"But I'll make it up to them later. I'm going to give them lots of chances. But to-day--to-day I <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> had to go--somewhere!\" At the Annex, with Alice Greggory and Arkwright, Billy sang duets and trios, and reveled in a sonorous wilderness of new music to her heart's content. Then, rested, refreshed, and at peace with all the world, she hurried home to dinner and to Bertram. \"There!

God's reality is felt in every fibre of the soul and brings convincement even to the body-mind. I would not give the impression that what I have described takes place in <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> this way every time, or that it happens without disruptions, lapses, roamings of the mind, day-dreams. Frequently I must recall myself, again still the mind and turn it Godwards, again practice waiting. All too often I awake to find, no, not that I have been actually sleeping, but that I might as well have been, so far have I strayed from the path that leads to God and brotherhood. And I must confess, too, that during some meetings I have been buried under inertia and deadness and...", "...said he didn't, but that he felt it was a safe thing to say and might make all the diffrence to anybody finding the message. Then I shot off the six messages rapped round stones, and they eesily flew over the edge of the qwarry. I then shouted again and eat my first egg. Just when it began to rain Morris had another grate idea. He said-- \"Didn't you say something about a packet of cigarets some time ago?\" And I said-- \"Yes, and I am glad you reminded me about them, becorse I <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> feal that one will do me a lot of good.\" Then I pulled them out and opened the packet and took one and lit it. \"It is very restful in such an adventure as this,\" I told Morris. Then he explained his idear. It is well none that when you are learning to smoak, your appetite is often spoilt for a time. Now Morris thort that if he smoaked, he would not want food, and so much valuable food might be saved, and life prolonged if necessary. He said-- \"To you, who smoak so...", "...like a great weight off his shoulders. At least his original plan was no longer a secret. \"Why weren't we told of this?\" Hank demanded. \"I didn't seriously think it would be something any of us would want,\" Matthew said. \"Harrell knew he couldn't acquire us without our consent, so I never feared a hostile takeover. An attempt to create a monopoly would be prevented by the FTC, and more seriously, the employees would rally against it, and our culture would be lost.\" \"But that's <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> it, Matthew,\" Hank said. \"Without any real future products in the pipeline our culture is essentially doomed.

They followed him in a wondering group.

The minister might discuss with the heads of the family such light matters as the crops or the weather before or during tea; but afterwards, when the family gathered in the best room with their pastor in the midst, temporal affairs were put aside and there was a season of deep heart-searching. There were the Catechism and Scripture verses to be heard from the younger members of the family and personal questions to be asked. The minister must know <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> what progress each one was making on the upward road. There were virtues to commend and mistakes to rebuke.

The seed of Abraham were not only to possess the land of Canaan, but they were to be God's instruments in executing His <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> judgment upon the guilty inhabitants, whose sins had risen up to heaven, and become absolutely intolerable. Does any one feel called upon to apologize for the divine actings toward the seven nations of Canaan? If so, let him be well assured of this, that his labor is perfectly gratuitous, entirely uncalled for.

The fine vessel was a brave sight as she sped arrowlike over the turquoise breast of Lake Leman, her straight stem shearing up a great scintillating blade of water on either side, her powerful paddles lashing up a long line of creaming rollers, hissing and curving away in her wake. From stem to stern she was gay with bunting, for this was but her second trip after being laid up through the winter season, and there was a spick-and-span newness about...", "...fear that had been driving him. Happily, the Blue Doctor chose to let the matter rest where it was, and if anything, seemed more willing than before to be friendly. For the first time he seemed to take an active interest in Fuzzy, \"chatting\" with him when he thought no one was around, and bringing him occasional tid-bits of food after meals were over. Once more life on the _Lancet_ settled back to routine, only to have it shattered by an incident of quite a different nature. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> after they had left a small planet in the Procyon system, one of the routine check-in points, that they made contact with the Garvian trading ship. Dal recognized the ship's design and insignia even before the signals came in, and could hardly contain his excitement. He had not seen a fellow countryman for years except for an occasional dull luncheon with the Garvian ambassador to Hospital Earth during medical school days. The thought of walking the corridors of a Garvian...", "...old castle. The most superstitious declared they had seen these fantastic creatures with their own eyes. Jack Ryan was naturally one of them. It was a fact that from time to time long flames appeared, sometimes on a broken piece of wall, sometimes on the summit of the tower which was the highest point of Dundonald Castle. Did these flames really assume a human shape, as was asserted? Did they merit the name of fire-maidens, given them by the people of the coast? It was evidently <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> an optical delusion, aided by a good deal of credulity, and science could easily have explained the phenomenon. However that might be, these fire-maidens had the reputation of frequenting the ruins of the old castle and there performing wild strathspeys, especially on dark nights. Jack Ryan, bold fellow though he was, would never have dared to accompany those dances with the music of his bagpipes. \"Old Nick is enough for them!\" said he. \"He doesn't need me to complete his...", "...public house on the Devon coast; all about a map and a treasure and a mutiny, and a derelict ship ... and a doctor and a sea-cook with one leg with the chorus 'yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,' ...

And always remember that the virtue lies not in the mere sound of the words that happen to reach the organ or cells--they do not understand words as words, but they do understand the meaning behind the words. But without words it is very hard for you to think, or clearly express the feeling--and so, by all means use the words <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as if the organ-mind understood the actual meaning thereof, for by so doing you can drive in the meaning of the word--and induce the mental state and conditions necessary to work the cure.

Then I glanced over my shoulder, and he was there, but hesitating as if he hadn't decided whether to come with me, or go back. When I saw this, I did stop and mumble in a low voice, \"It _is_ you, isn't it, Mr. Brett?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"I hope you forgive me?\" \"Oh, I thank you,\" said I. \"I--wanted to come...", "...'I DID think of getting away this morning, and making better terms with you from a distance.'

Whig pride was deeply revolted at subjection to a prime minister whom in their drawing-rooms they mocked as an old tory. In the Aberdeen cabinet, says Mr. Gladstone, 'it may be thought that the whigs, whose party was to supply five-sixths or seven-eighths of our supporters, had less than their due share of power. It should, however, be borne in mind that...", "...to all the rules and regulations of the service. Now, sir, hear me--\" \"O Lord, sir! let me off this time, it's only a _soldier_,\" replied Smallbones, deprecatingly; but Snarleyyow's appetite had been very much sharpened by his morning's walk; it rose with the smell of the herring, so he rose on his hind legs, snapped the herring out of Smallbones' hand, bolted forward by the lee gangway, and would soon have bolted the herring, had not Smallbones bolted after him and overtaken him <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as he had laid it down on the deck preparatory to commencing his meal. A fight ensued: Smallbones received a severe bite in the leg, which induced him to seize a handspike, and make a blow with it at the dog's head, which, if it had been well aimed, would have probably put an end to all further pilfering. As it was, the handspike descended upon one of the dog's fore toes, and Snarleyyow retreated, yelling, to the other side of the forecastle, and as soon as he was out of reach,...", "...the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!\" (_a-a-men! glory, glory hallelujah!_) And so on. You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> crazy and wild. Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him over everybody; and next he went a-charging up onto the platform, and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he'd been robbed last night and put...", "...surely, advanced towards his end. All that he owed to the Emperor was effaced from his mind; what he himself had done for the Emperor was imprinted in burning characters on his memory. To his insatiable thirst for power, the Emperor's ingratitude was welcome, as it seemed to tear in pieces the record of past favours, to absolve him from every obligation towards his former benefactor. In the disguise of a righteous retaliation, the projects dictated by his ambition now appeared to him <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> and pure. In proportion as the external circle of his operations was narrowed, the world of hope expanded before him, and his dreamy imagination revelled in boundless projects, which, in any mind but such as his, madness alone could have given birth to. His services had raised him to the proudest height which it was possible for a man, by his own efforts, to attain. Fortune had denied him nothing which the subject and the citizen could lawfully enjoy.

Already she feared that she had lost him. \"Why do you keep your studio door locked from the inside?\" she demanded, turning the key to open it. \"Because I don't care to be interrupted while I am working,\" Cron retorted significantly. \"As a rule, visitors don't have the effrontery to come in the windows!\" Penny did not reply to the gibe.

They first sold their lives, and with greed for death itself, killed some of their false friends, really their enemies--among them the very chief who contrived that treachery. The other Spaniards sought shelter in a small boat which they had there, left the river, and went to our fort, giving news of the disaster just as Captain Lazaro de Torres arrived. With the help that had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> come to them, they determined to take vengeance for that perfidy. The commandant sent the said captain, Lazaro de Torres, with one of the galleys which they had there, accompanied by one hundred infantrymen. They entered the river of Tanchuy, which is very beautiful, and densely inhabited by the natives. The latter immediately deserted their settlements, and our men went to the rice granaries, and filled their galley and four large champans, which are used as freight ships in...", "...whispered, \"You are so fond of Nugent--I begin to be almost afraid there will be no love left for me.\" Oscar was enchanted. \"Wait till you see him, and you will be as fond of him as I am,\" he said. \"Nugent is not like me. He fascinates people the moment they come in contact with him. Nobody can resist Nugent.\" She still held his hand, with a perplexed and saddened face. The admirable absence of any jealousy on his side--his large and generous confidence in _her_ love for _him_--was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> the rebuke to her that she could feel; just the rebuke also (in my opinion) that she had deserved. \"Go on, Oscar,\" said the rector, in his deepest notes of encouragement. \"What next, dear boy? what next?\" \"Another interesting bit, of quite a new kind,\" Oscar replied. \"There is a little mystery to stir us up on the last page of the letter.

His position was in about the centre of a straight portion of the line of the woods, ending at a point nearest to the stream. He had been informed that Lieutenant Lyon would command the detachment that was to move towards the pike. This force could do little or nothing with their horses in the meadow, any more than the Confederate company. The sergeant had arranged in his mind <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> how the affair should be managed, and believed that Deck would hear his advice, as he often had before, whether he followed it or not. The enemy remained at a halt in the stream, the officers and most of the troopers watching the woods in the direction from which the commands came; for Life had repeated them at intervals for some time. Like a prudent commander, the captain seemed to be unwilling to continue his fight with the mud until the unseen enemy, if there was one, had...", "...how much the good people resemble the wicked ones.\" Miss Grainger, who usually smiled at his levities, looked grave at this one, and no more was said, as they moved on towards the cottage. CHAPTER VIII. GROWING DARKER IT was late at night when Calvert left the villa, but, instead of rowing directly back to the little inn, he left his boat to drift slowly in the scarce perceptible current of the lake, and wrapping himself in his cloak, lay down to muse or to sleep. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as day broke that he awoke, and saw that he had drifted within a few yards of his quarters, and in a moment after he was on shore. As he gained his room, he found a letter for him in Loyd's hand. It ran thus: \"I waited up all night to see you before I started, for I have been suddenly summoned home by family circumstances. I was loth to part in an angry spirit, or even in coldness, with one in whose companionship I have passed so many happy hours,...", "...For such statements in regard to General Jackson at New Orleans as differ from the ordinary narrative I am indebted to a work never published, so far as I am aware, in this country or in the English language--Vincent Nolte's \"Fifty Years in Both Hemispheres,\" issued in Hamburg in 1853. As Nolte owned the cotton which Jackson appropriated, and also served as a volunteer in the battle of New Orleans, he ought to be good authority. In dealing with the late war I have sought to be <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> to both the Union and the Confederacy. The lapse of over thirty years has given a more accurate perspective to the events of that mighty struggle, in which, as a soldier-boy of sixteen, I was an obscure participant, and all true Americans, whether they wore the blue or gray, now look back with pride to the splendid valor and heroic endurance displayed by the combatants on both sides. Those who belittle the constancy and courage of the South belittle the sacrifices and successes of...", "...inhabitants--clipped words, formless sentences, potted expressions of approval or disgust. Month by month things were stepping livelier, but to what goal? The population still rose, but what was the quality of the men born?

He was not a fool--she had heard him expose Socialism--but true insight began <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> where his intelligence ended, and one gathered that this was the case with most millionaires. What right had such men--But Margaret checked herself. That way lies madness. Thank goodness she, too, had some money, and could purchase a new home.

Tibby didn't know that he did know. Did he...", "...Red River, had handed me, unsolicited, a very useful notification. So far, then, I had got within the outer circle of this so jealously protected settlement. The guard, whose presence had so often been the theme of Manitoban journals, the picquet line which extended from Pembina Mountain to Lake of the Woods (150 miles), was nowhere visible, and I. began to think that the whole thing was only a myth, and that the Red River revolt was as unsubstantial as the Spectre of the Brocken. But <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> then, as I stood on the high roof of the \"International,\" from whence a wide view was obtained, I saw across the level prairie outside the huts of Pembina the figures of two horsemen riding at a rapid pace towards the north. They were on the road to Fort Garry. The long July day passed slowly away, and evening began to darken over the level land, to find us still steaming down the widening reaches of the Red River. But the day had shown symptoms sufficient to convince me that...", "...no mistake about those glaring eyes, and taking hasty aim, he fired. The report of the firearm had not yet died away when there came the wild and unmistakable screech of a wounded bob cat--a wildcat well known in certain portions of our southern states. At the same time the dog began to bark furiously, and everybody on board the launch was aroused. \"What's the matter?\" \"Who fired that shot?\" \"Vos dose rascals here to fight mit us alretty?\" \"It's a bob cat!\" cried Dick. \"Tom <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> fired at it!\" \"Look out, it's coming down!\" yelled Tom, and that instant the bob cat, unable to support itself longer on the tree limb, fell with a snarl on the rubber covering of the launch, carrying it down upon those underneath. The next few minutes things happened so rapidly that it is almost impossible to describe them. The bob cat rolled over and over, clawing at the rubber cloth and ripping it to shreds. The boys tried to get another shot, but did not dare to fire for...", "...small rooms. Wherever she turned her head, too, another Susan stared at her, and this made her feel shy and uncomfortable. \"Isn't it a beautiful room?\" said Margaretta, seating herself on a pompous yellow sofa. \"So cheerful!\" Before Susan could answer, Mrs Winslow came in. She was a fair lady with a very straight nose, and she welcomed them kindly, and asked after Sophia Jane. \"My little people,\" she continued, scarcely waiting, Susan noticed, for Margaretta's answer, \"are <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> returning from their walk. Air and light are as necessary to the young as to flowers, are they not? How can we expect their minds to expand unless the body is healthy?\" \"No, indeed,\" said Margaretta. Mrs Winslow then proposed that they should go and take off their hats, which being done she led the way down-stairs into the dining-room, where the \"little people\" were already assembled with their governess for their early dinner. During this Susan had plenty of time for...", "...me at Mrs Lyttelton's school, Annie would never have been a thief; there would have been no need--no need!

She came close to the bed. \"Yes?\" \"What's happened?\" said he. \"I've had some awful nightmare. And then you broke it up. Hasn't Martin been here too?\" \"Yes, Archie, I think so,\" she said. He lay in silence a moment. \"Have you saved me again, Jessie?\" he said. \"You did once before at--at...", "...laughing softly, \"but you have two legs to march on. I have only one and this stick.\" Marcus glanced sharply down at the speaker, and, seeing the boy's intention, the old fellow laughed again. \"Oh, yes, you are thinking I lie.

A tremendous yell went up. \"Come down, Frank--oh! quick!\" he caught above the clamor, and he knew that it was Will's shrill voice he heard. The fire was perilously close to the rope. In a second it might catch and be severed. Frank did not hesitate. He was accustomed to meeting emergencies promptly, and doing the right thing. Down he slipped, passing the threatening flame, in fact shooting through it <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as the rope began to be consumed in its hot breath. Frank had almost reached the point of safety when he felt his support collapse, and he dropped downward. Something caught him, something that seemed endowed with life--the extended arms of his three chums eagerly fashioned into a net, and he was not injured, beyond a little singeing of his hair as he passed through the fiery torch.

Miss Baker brewed a cup of tea to quiet her nerves. Each tried to regain their...", "...cut; but then the swift rush of the spoil train was also lessened. The want of fall in the rails was telling on her progress, though, to be sure, she was hurtling along at a speed approximating to fifty miles an hour; but the bump she had given to Jim's car had had a wonderful effect. It had shot the light framework forward, and, with luck, Jim determined to increase the start thus obtained. \"But it'll be touch and go,\" he told himself, his eye now directed to the switching station, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> beyond which the mass of derelict French cars lay. \"There's one thing in my favour: the points open from this direction.

Might not the mark whereby to remember, be also a mark whereby to recognise? After short reflection he once more seized the manuscript with feverish haste and read further:-- \"These confidences made an immense impression upon us children, and often, as we sat idly by twilight before the gate of the synagogue, we discussed our father's narrative with mournful emotion, always coming to the conclusion, that we would do all in our power...", "...with you!\" \"Can't be helped,\" he exclaimed, polishing laboriously. \"It can.

She was fond of her stepsisters, but her most conscious affection was the one she felt for her horse. She left him at the stable and, fastening up her riding-skirt, she walked slowly home. She had not far to go. A steep street, where narrow-fronted old houses informed the public that apartments were to be let within, brought her to the broad space of grass and trees called The Green, which she had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> passed on her horse. Straight ahead of her was the wide street flanked by houses of which her home was one--a low white building hemmed in on each side by another and with a small walled garden in front of it; not a large house, but one full of character and of quiet self-assurance. Malletts had lived in it for several generations, long before the opposite houses were built, long before the road had, lower down, degenerated into a region of shops. These houses, all rechristened in...", "...the world upon the subject of polar exploration. They went, struggled so bravely that their loss of life was greater than on any expedition since the fatal one under Franklin--and came back without succeeding.

But, in spite of Captain Nares's positiveness, the Arctic question is now <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> where he took it up. Seventy miles has been added to the distance covered, but the world is just as unsatisfied as ever, and polar exploration is just as ardently desired as ever. The spirit is unchanged, but the name is altered. Against the uniform report of the explorers who have been so numerous during the last decade that a mere journey to the pole is not likely to yield much addition to man's knowledge, it is hardly possible for even the most enthusiastic navigators to stand...", "...her husband has been sick for a month or more, and I try to brighten her home up a bit.

And truly I am as well as ever, or will be in a few days. If you tell him anything, tell him I'll be down to see him this fall.

Little he thought that, from a shot-window near the door, a pair of blue eyes, like Lilith's, but paler and colder, were watching him <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as a spider watches the fly that is likely ere long to fall into his toils. And into those toils Karl soon fell.

Then she ordered a fly and drove to the police station--at that time a mean little stone edifice, exceedingly repulsive without and excessively filthy within. A crowd of disreputable-looking ragamuffins of both sexes and all ages obstructed the entrance. Surely it was a revolting scene to one of Lady Vincent's fastidious nature and refined habits. But she did not shrink from her duty. She made her way through this disgusting assemblage, and found <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> within the door a policeman, to whom she said: \"I wish, if you please, to see your inspector.\" \"You will have to wait in the outer room, then, miss, because he is engaged now,\" replied the man curtly; for the beauty of the woman, the costliness of her apparel, and the fact of her having come unattended to a place like that, filled the mind of the officer with evil suspicions concerning her. He opened a door on the left and let the visitor pass into the anteroom--a wretched...", "...of protection to his life. The removal to Cadiz I take to have been a mere act of desperation.

It certainly is odd that a measure for getting rid of tithes should fall into the hands of the members for the...", "...a hundred years more, for he introduced another patriarch as his father. This shrunken anatomy, blind, almost speechless, and more like \"a dead carkeis than a living body,\" he said, was likely to last thirty or forty years longer. Probably the Frenchman had heard of the fabled fountain of Bimini, which lured Ponce de Leon to his ruin, and the river Jordan, which was said to be somewhere in Florida and to possess the same virtue, and he fancied that the gourd of cool water which had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> been given him might come from such a spring.[1] {79} This example shows how credulous these Frenchmen were, moving in a world of fancy, the glamour of romantic dreams about the New World still fresh upon them, visions of unmeasured treasures of silver and gold and gems floating through their brains.

In the party...", "...by the father of that wild enthusiast John Brown. A great reader, an able contributor to the Western press, and a most public-spirited citizen, Jesse Grant was a good father to his famous son, who was born on April 27, 1822, at Point Pleasant, Clermont County, Ohio. Young Grant hated the tannery, but delighted in everything connected with horses; so he looked after the teams. One day, after swapping horses many miles from home, he found himself driving a terrified bolter that he only <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> managed to stop on the edge of a big embankment. His grown-up companion, who had no stomach for any more, then changed into a safe freight wagon. But Ulysses, tying his bandanna over the runaway's eyes, stuck to the post of danger. After passing through West Point without any special distinction, except that he came out first in horsemanship, Grant was disappointed at not receiving the cavalry commission which he would have greatly preferred to the infantry one he was given...", "...A rapid flash from Bonaparte's eyes struck the count's face and met his sharp, searching glance. \"Count Cobenzl,\" he said, quietly and coldly, \"the lilies of France have dropped from their stems, and, being drowned in the blood of the guillotine, they could not be made to bloom again.

Let me assure you, however, that even my country's ingratitude would be dearer to me than the gratitude of a foreign power, and that the crown of thorns, which France may press upon my head, would seem to me more honorable than the coronet with which an enemy of France might adorn my brow.

If the question of eligibility is raised at all, the answer is given on the tacit principle that \"whatever purpose is, is right.\" To the \"plain man,\" and to all of us on certain sides of our lives, every purpose for which the requisite means and factual conditions are found to be at hand is, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as our purpose, therefore right. The same experience of failure and disappointment which proves our purpose to have been, from the standpoint of enlargement and enrichment of the self, a mistaken one brings a clearer consciousness of the logic implicit in our first confident belief in the purpose, and at the same time emphasizes the need of making this logic explicit. The purpose, as warranted to us by the conditions and assembled means that lay before us, was our own, and _as...", "...nearer eighty than seventy when I saw him, and I recall of him personally his dark tint, and the scholarly refinement of his clean-shaven face, which seemed to me rather English than American in character. He was quite exterior to the Atlantic group of writers, and had no interest in me as one of it. Literary Boston of that day was not a solidarity, as I soon perceived; and I understood that it was only in my quality of stranger that I saw the different phases of it. I should not be <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> to a vivid phase if I failed to speak of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and the impulse of reform which she personified. I did not sympathize with this then so much as I do now, but I could appreciate it on the intellectual side. Once, many years later, I heard Mrs. Howe speak in public, and it seemed to me that she made one of the best speeches I had ever heard.

Watch out, Ralph. We need you too much to have you taking chances.\" But the evening passed quickly, with the customary songs and merriment. Minnie was, of course, present. She had come with Dottie Warren, and once, when it chanced that she and Frank met face to face, she looked annoyed because she had to speak. However, Frank's nod was just as cold as her own. He sang with even more vim than customary, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> to show her that he was not caring in the least. Still, there were curious eyes that noted the breach, and more than one group of girls commented on the fact. \"They've certainly had a falling out,\" said Emily Dodsworth, the primp, and she tried to look horrified, even while secretly pleased, because she was herself very fond of Frank. \"Isn't it dreadful, girls? But then I thought their friendship was too sudden to last long. Perhaps Frank may understand now that 'old friends...", "...in the hearth. The howling mistral or tramontana makes the doors bang, the reeds scream, and a range of noises that make the great, natural clamour all around. The rays of the winter sun gather and are then scattered by the fierce wind. Great shadows race around under a perfect blue sky. The light comes in flashes, and the noise in crashes, and the flock's bells are suddenly heard, then lost in the wind, only to emerge again under the rattling door like a charming refrain.... Twilight, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> before the hunters come back, is the most exquisite time of day. By then the wind has moderated. I go out for a moment; the great red sun, at peace at last, goes down in flames, but without heat. Night falls and brushes you with its damp, black wing as it passes over.

Meanwhile, in the interest of our better acquaintance, can I persuade you to sit down, and allow me to cast myself at your feet?\" The girl, with a clear, mellow laugh, sat down, and the young man reclined in the position he had indicated, gazing up at her with intense admiration in his eyes. \"If this be war,\" he said to himself, \"long may I remain a soldier.\" Infatuated as he certainly...", "...when entrusted with the discharge of a public duty. The London _Times_ published a full report of his admonition, which it pronounced to be the best paper of the kind on record. During the following summer an event took place which removed Attorney-General Robinson from the atmosphere of the Assembly, and was the indirect means of introducing Robert Baldwin to public life. This was the appointment of Mr. Robinson to the place of Chief Justice of Upper Canada. The office had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> become vacant through the retirement of Chief Justice Campbell, who had received the honour of knighthood during his absence in England. Mr. Robinson thus obtained the reward which he had long coveted, and which his devotion to successive Lieutenant-Governors had richly earned.

To remove the doubt he accepted the position of Registrar of the County...", "...upper part of the small intestine.

It is in osteology, however, that the information of Celsus is chiefly conspicuous.

In democracies, as the conditions of life are very fluctuating, men have almost always recently acquired the advantages which they possess; the consequence is that they feel extreme pleasure in exhibiting them, to show others and convince themselves that they really enjoy them. As at any instant these same advantages may be lost, their possessors are constantly on the alert, and make a point of showing that they still retain them. Men living in democracies love their country <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as they love themselves, and they transfer the habits of their private vanity to their vanity as a nation. The restless and insatiable vanity of a democratic people originates so entirely in the equality and precariousness of social conditions, that the members of the haughtiest nobility display the very same passion in those lesser portions of their existence in which there is anything fluctuating or contested.

I had also formed no <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> conception of the obstacles that impeded me.

Money means so little in comparison.\" But her reflections were rudely interrupted. A black scarf was thrown over her head and she was lifted off her feet and carried out of the circle of light into the darkness.

To render 'upright' instead of 'smooth' seems to make the statement almost an identical proposition, and is tame.

The celebration of the ordinary Sabbath, indeed, commenced on the evening of Friday, and terminated at the going down of the sun on Saturday. \"From even unto even shall ye celebrate your Sabbaths.\" But the Jews, in the concluding period of their government, had innovated so far on the Mosaical institution as to prohibit the passover from being observed on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, and to appoint the celebration of it on the...", "...him that I did not.

For an instant he ventured to protest. \"But, your Majesty--\" he began, but he got no further. The King checked him with a frown and a raised hand. It was easy to make him obstinate in crossing a follower. \"You have heard my commands,\" he said, sternly. Sir Rufus bowed his head and retreated. There was nothing else for him to do.

He turned to Brilliana. \"I am a complaisant monarch, as I think,\" he said. \"Now, lady, do your best to make your sweetheart see reason.

She will have other things to think about just now.\" Parker wondered vaguely what those other things were; but she did not say a word. For a minute or two Enid also was silent, and thought of Flossy. What was she doing? Of what was she thinking now? As a matter of fact, Flossy was at that moment <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> awakening to a sick shuddering consciousness of what had happened. She had gone to her room and fallen to the floor in a death-like swoon. When she was able to move, she crept to the bell and rang again and again for Parker.

No doubt we might suppose it to be in a constant state of vibration, and to have the temperature corresponding to that state, whatever that may be; but this, in addition to leaving us <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> where we were, would only entail upon us the task of supplying temperature as well as density to a body of whose existence no positive proof has hitherto been given, whatever we may believe about it.

How immense it looked in that little room! The thing was tremendous, overpowering--the tooth of a gigantic fossil, golden and dazzling. Beside it everything seemed dwarfed. Even McTeague himself, big boned and enormous as he was, shrank and...", "...thy hidden ways his chosen study. One maxim hast thou, O Commerce, great and true and profitable above all others;--one law which thy votaries should never transgress. \"Buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest.\" May those divine words be ever found engraved on the hearts of Brown, Jones, and Robinson! Of Mr. Brown, the senior member of our firm, it is expedient that some short memoir should be given. At the time at which we signed our articles in 185--, Mr. Brown had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> retired from the butter business. It does not appear that in his early youth he ever had the advantage of an apprenticeship, and he seems to have been employed in various branches of trade in the position, if one may say so, of an out-door messenger. In this capacity he entered the service of Mr. McCockerell, a retail butter dealer in Smithfield. When Mr. McCockerell died our Mr. Brown married his widow, and thus found himself elevated at once to the full-blown dignity of a...", "...they rode on like that for some time, without exchanging a look. The noise of the hunt came nearer, the thickets seemed to tremble, and suddenly the wild boar broke through the bushes, covered with blood, and trying to shake off the hounds who had fastened onto him, and the baron, uttering a shout of triumph, exclaimed: \"Let him who loves me, follow me!\" And he disappeared in the copse, as if the wood had swallowed him up. When she reached an open glade a few minutes later, he was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> getting up, covered with mud, his coat torn, and his hands bloody, while the brute was lying stretched out at full length, with the baron's hunting knife driven into its shoulder up to the hilt. The quarry was cut at night by torchlight. It was a warm and dull evening, and the wan moon threw a yellow light onto the torches which made the night misty with their resinous smoke. The hounds devoured the wild boar's stinking entrails, and snarled and fought for them, while the...", "...fourth--a fifth; we saw the flashes of each; they came, without doubt, from the deck of the yawl. \"Firing!\" she murmured. \"Fighting!\" said I. \"That's just--listen to that!\" Half a dozen reports, sharp, insistent, rang out in quick succession; then two or three, all mingling together; the echoes followed from wood and cliff. Rapidly as the flashes pierced the gloom, the sounds died out--a heavy silence followed. \"That's just what?\" asked Miss Raven--calmly. \"Well, if not <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> what I expected, it's at any rate partly what I expected,\" I said. \"It had already struck me that if--well, supposing whatever it was that the Chinaman dropped into those glasses didn't act quite as soporifically as he intended it to, and Baxter and his companion woke up and found there was a conspiracy, a mutiny, going on, there'd be--eh?\" \"Fighting?\" she suggested. \"You're not a squeamish girl,\" I answered. \"There'd be bloody murder!

Murray rushed in <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> at the recoil, when Tom May had been roused to action and with a couple of companions was obeying the admonition of his messmate to show the varmint what British bulldogs might be. Murray paused just inside the door of the lit-up room, excited and yet amused by the man's action, for he saw the big sailor in the act of rushing at a couple of the enemy, sticking the cutlass he bore between his teeth, as trusting to his great strength and weight he charged with doubled fists at the...", "...he carries his ideas of order into everything.

Bertrand Ballard was known and loved by all the youths. Some from the village, and others from the country around, had been in the way of coming to the Ballard home simply because the place was made an enjoyable center for them. Some came to practice the violin and others to sing. Some came to try their hand at sketching and painting and some <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> to hear Bertrand talk. All was done for them quite gratuitously on his part, and no laugh was merrier than his. Even the chore boy came in for a share of the Ballards' kindly help, sitting at Mary Ballard's side in the long winter evenings, and conning lessons to patch up an education snatched haphazard and hardly come by.

The crushed berries were hastily pushed in by Willie, leaving large purple stains on her lips and chin, and in his haste and fear of being discovered he let several fall on her pale blue pelisse. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> at this moment that Nurse Barlow looked round. \"Master Willie!

This news at once despatched my poor mother on her travels, and she had only <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> come from the prison, where she learned my address. I asked her whether she had seen my wife, and how she found her.

Naturally Webster thought ill of John Temple, and was not sure how he would act when he heard the wife was dead whom he had forsaken. And then, Temple knew not where to find May. \"No one knows where to find her but myself,\" reflected Webster, and a great struggle took place in his heart. \"Shall I again destroy the peace that is <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> dawning? tell her the man who treated her so vilely is now able to marry her if he will?

He examined her companions' passports, but let her through with an airy \"Sure, this young lady's all right,\" which made Cecilia feel that no further proof could be needed of her respectability.

As Errol paused, Marchant smiled at the rest of us, a sickly smile, I thought, as though he would have said that the play was being carried too far. Never for a moment did Errol take from him the menacing look. It was only a moment in the play, yet it was so unexpected that it seemed ages.

It was our duty, even more from the standpoint of National honor than from the standpoint of National interest, to stop the devastation and destruction. Because of these considerations I favored war; and to-day, when in retrospect it is easier to see things clearly, there are few humane and honorable men who do not believe that the war was both <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> and necessary. The big financiers and the men generally who were susceptible to touch on the money nerve, and who cared nothing for National honor if it conflicted even temporarily with business prosperity, were against the war. The more fatuous type of philanthropist agreed with them.

Talavera composed the disputes, and the Cardinal had to retire. Ximenes was, however, not a man to be easily deterred from his purpose.

There was one unexpectedly violent movement of the growth <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> opposite, and there he thought his hog was dying.

Henceforward the Pope put himself on John's side. He risked the alienation of the French king by forbidding the enterprise which had been undertaken at his command: he rejected the appeal of the barons, disapproved Magna Charta, transferred the excommunication to its authors with an ease which surely must have helped these unlikely penitents to despise both the anathema and its source.

Hence by an obvious analogy the best authors were rated as _classici_, or men of the highest class; <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as in English we say 'men of rank' absolutely for men who are in the highest ranks of the State.\" Thus Trench, and his historical definition, explains why in music also there is something more than a lurking suggestion of excellence in the conception of \"classical;\" but that fact does not put away the quarrel which we feel exists between Classic and Romantic.

He had been relating some humorous anecdote to her ladyship, who was laughing heartily at it. Evidently she was in a good-humour, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as these men wished her to be. Belotto, I noticed, paid for the dinner, and then all four walked down the arcade into the Piazza where they entered a closed cab and were driven off. My own idea is that they were going to a theatre, but as I followed them in another conveyance I quickly found that we were travelling in an opposite direction, namely up the broad Corso Venezia and out by the city gate into that suburb that lies beyond the ancient fortifications. Outside the town...", "...Staubach Fall, nearly a thousand feet high, is far from being such a thing of beauty as I had hoped to find it. It comes from such a height and has so small a body of water, that it dissolves into spray, and falling upon the rocks gathers itself up again and leaps down into the valley. Byron compares it to the tail of the white horse in the Apocalypse. Wordsworth speaks of it as a \"heaven-born waterfall,\" and Murray likens it to a \"beautiful lace veil suspended from a precipice.\" It is <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> at the entrance of the village of Lauterbrunnen, which lies in a valley literally gloomy and sublime. The sides of the mountains that shut it in are precipitous and so lofty that in winter the sun does not climb the eastern side till noon, and so cold is it through the summer, that only the hardiest fruits can be raised. I counted between twenty and thirty cascades leaping over the brow of these mountains and plunging into the valley. In the calm of the evening, after the sun had...", "...with as much force as Hazlitt upon the need of basing all poetry on \"human nature and the nature of things at large\"; upon the fact that its principles are written \"in the hearts and imaginations of all men\". But, unlike Hazlitt, he bids us also consider what the aim of the individual poet was, and how far he has taken the most fitting means to reach it. In other words, he allows, as Hazlitt did not allow, for the many-sidedness of poetry, and the infinite variety of poetic genius. And, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> because he does so, he is able to give a deeper meaning to \"nature\" and the universal principles of imagination than Hazlitt, with all his critical and reflective brilliance, was in a position to do. Hazlitt is too apt to confine \"nature\" to the nature of Englishmen in general and, in his weaker moments, of Hazlitt in particular. Carlyle makes an honest attempt to bound it only by the universal instincts of man, and the \"everlasting reason\" of the world. Thus, in Carlyle's...", "...made other and much better boats. Other men followed in his footsteps, and the great ocean liners of to-day are one of the results. CHAPTER XXXVI THE CITY PLAN It is interesting at this time to read how the streets came to be just where they are. The city was growing more rapidly than ever and the streets and byways met one another at every sort of angle, forming a tangled maze. To remedy this, a commission was formed of several of the prominent citizens to determine <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> what course the streets should take. Now this commission decided not to interfere with those that existed, but to map out the island above the city and plan for those that were to be. They worked for four years and then submitted, in the year 1811, what they called the City Plan. If you will look at a map, you will see at the lower part of the Island of Manhattan that the streets cross and recross each other in the most bewildering manner. And you will also see that above this...", "...never come back under similar conditions--I shall be out of town.\" When the battle was over, the damsel who had had an additional turn, when she took leave, asked the canon to give her something as a keepsake. Without waiting to be too much importuned, and also to get rid of them, the good canon handed them the remainder of a piece of stuff for kerchiefs, which he gave them, and the \"principal\" received the gift, and they said farewell. \"It is,\" he said, \"all that I can give you <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> now; so take it in good part.\" They had not gone very far, and were in the street, when the neighbour, who had had nothing more than one turn, told her companion that she wanted her share of the gift. \"Very well,\" said the other, \"I have no objection. How much do you want?\" \"Need you ask that,\" said she. \"I am going to have half, and you the same.\" \"How dare you ask,\" said the other, \"more than you have earned? Have you no shame? You know well that you only went once...", "...shimmer like a fairy sea. The little whitewashed houses of the village clung to the side of the dark mountain as if they feared some evil fairy might push them down into the water. Suddenly out of the evening silence came the sound of music. Far below their window the Sunbonnet Babies could see a young singer with his mandolin. His clear, high voice gave the lovely Italian song a strange beauty on the evening air. \"Is it fairyland, or is it heaven?\" Molly whispered. \"Or are we <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> dreaming?\" asked May, as they crept into the little white beds that were waiting for them. [Illustration: Pirates] [Illustration] PIRATES Next morning Molly and May were awake early, watching the busy boats come home after a long night of fishing out on the deep sea. They ran down the many steps to the shore, where the tired fishermen were hauling in their nets and counting their catch. The big nets were then spread out to dry. Later in the day they would be...", "...Strange, he told himself. All right, it might be strange, but if it worked, what difference did it make? So the planet's denizens were sexless because there was no need of sex--what was wrong with that? It might, in fact, Duncan admitted to himself, head off a lot of trouble. No family spats, no triangle trouble, no fighting over mates. While it might be unexciting, it did seem downright peaceful. And since there was no sex, the Cytha species was the planetary mother--but more than <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> a mother. The Cytha, more than likely, was mother-father, incubator, nursery, teacher and perhaps many other things besides, all rolled into one. In many ways, he thought, it might make a lot of sense. Here natural selection would be ruled out and ecology could be controlled in considerable degree and mutation might even be a matter of deliberate choice rather than random happenstance. And it would make for a potential planetary unity such as no other world had ever known....", "...from themselves--from State interposition, as authorized in the Virginia resolutions of 1798; and as recently carried out by South Carolina in her nullification proceedings; and declared that nothing was wanted but \"concert\" among themselves to place their domestic institutions, their peace and security under their own protection and beyond the reach of danger. All this was thus intelligibly, and ominously stated in his reply to Mr. King: \"Thus far (I say it with regret) our <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> hopes have not been realized.

The only point discussed in the solemn family conclave was as to whether she should not be Jane Prudence. 'Oh, for mercy's sake, call the poor little kid Jurisprudence, and be done with it,' said a flippant uncle--and that had settled it. Prudence Jane was duly entered at the end of the list in the middle of the Family Bible, and her career began. Through eight years she was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> unmitigated Prudence Jane,--not a syllable of it could ever be omitted lest one grandmother or the other be slighted,--and then suddenly one day she decided that it was a combination no longer to be borne. She hated her name with all her little soul; therefore she would discard it and take another. This sounded simple, but there were, in fact, several complications. The most important was Aunt Annie. Never a really progressive spirit, in this matter of names Aunt Annie showed...", "...day before Christmas. Cynthia sat in her own room by the bed, which was covered with presents in various stages of completion; some tied up and marked, ready to be sent, others only half finished, and one or two but just begun. Bob, as usual, lay at her feet. \"There!\" cried she, as with a loud snap her needle broke for the third time; \"there it goes again. I believe I'll give up this wretched frame and all the other things that are not finished, and go to Boston this morning.

I was sure we'd never come out of this alive,\" cried Grace miserably. \"Isn't it enough to have our hearts broken, without our necks in the bargain?\" \"Oh, might as well make a good job of it,\" returned Mollie cheerfully. \"I don't know that I'd mind very much, anyway.\" \"Oh, now I know I'm going to cry!\" wailed Grace, wiping a starting tear with her handkerchief. \"Just when we're almost at Camp, too, and apt to meet somebody any minute--\" \"Didn't you <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> hear Betty say,\" Mollie broke in, with the patient air one assumes in speaking to little children, \"that everybody who is really worth anything has gone away on that train?\" \"Well, I guess I didn't altogether mean that,\" said Betty thoughtfully. \"Of course there is the medical personnel that is stationed here indefinitely and very much against its will.

It is true they were small ones, and some of the heads which he could see by the blaze, were small--they were not jaguars, but they had an ugly look--they looked like the heads of serpents!

He fully believed they were snakes--anacondas, or water-snakes no doubt--that had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> crept out of the river; and he felt that a movement on his part would bring on their united and simultaneous attack upon the sleeping party. Partly influenced by this fear, and again exhibiting that coolness and prudence which we have already noticed as a trait of his character, he remained for some moments silent and motionless. Having already risen to his feet, his eyes were now above the level of the blaze, and, as they got the sleep well scared out of them, he could see...", "...with you and is doing so well with the commissariat.

A careful examination of the masonry showed that the work of bricking up the entrance had undoubtedly been done from the other side, and after the door had been closed and bolted.

Henley worked his hinge between some of the looser joints, and found, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as he expected, that the mortar had been laid from within. By degrees he managed to wedge one of the bricks out of its place, and then pulled it bodily from the wall. The inner surface was plastered over.

They went down into the basement, where there was a dark room fitted up as a restaurant, and here the students were able to get the same sort of fare as they might have at an aerated bread shop. While they ate (Philip had a scone and butter and a cup of chocolate), he discovered that his companion was called Dunsford.

In still earlier times, while ice was accumulating farther north, the basins of these semi-arid regions were filled with lakes whose strands still remain to tell the tale of much-increased rainfall and presumable storminess. If we go back still further in geological times to the Permian glaciation, the areas where ice accumulated most abundantly appear to be the regions where tropical hurricanes produce the greatest rainfall and the...", "...Even when jurors were selected by governors, the most unmeasured denunciations were poured forth without fear of prosecution. Associations for the redress of grievances have carried their organizations to the very verge of constitutional order. A democratic state certainly would never have tolerated the discussion of its principles and authority in feeble dependencies. But the British government, secure in its power and serenely conscious of its ability to check an intrusion on its <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> authority, has encouraged rather than repressed the freedom of public discussion and combination. The local rulers, instructed by their superiors, have long permitted even the licentiousness of the press. The strength of the empire justified and accounted for its tolerance. There is no tyranny so watchful as that of fear, and no cruelty so relentless as that of factions who struggle for existence. The non-dependence of the government on the people has united the colonists in...", "...you and the cur together if you didn't have that kid on deck,\" sneered the gambler. \"You couldn't thump a drum,\" answered Jim, easily. \"Come back here, Tintoretto.

A faint rustling sound drew my attention <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> then, somewhere near the head of my bed; but it ceased directly, and I attributed it to the servants. To prove this, I made up my mind to clap my hands, but at the first movement such a keen pain shot through my shoulder that I contented myself by calling, \"Who waits?\" There was a quick rustling sound at once, and the purdah was drawn aside by a shadowy figure, and held while three men in white entered with trays so quickly and silently that I felt as if I were going through...", "...clothes of all kinds and colors which the people in the homeland had sent to her. \"You must wear these to church tomorrow,\" said Mary. \"In God's house you must be clean.

Many of them came <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> out of curiosity, but there were many who had learned to know and love and trust in Jesus. Mary now started day classes and these too were crowded because many wanted to learn \"book.\" They wanted to learn about Ma's God and about the Saviour who took away sins.

They no longer feared the demons because they had a Saviour who loved them and...", "...Negra's manly tenderness was appreciated by everyone and old Onucz, radiant with joy, turned towards his cronies: \"You see it is not my money but my daughter that he is after!\" And yet if Fatia Negra had only been able to foresee what was about to happen the next instant, if only he had been able to guess what would happen during the first few moments of the first approaching quarter of an hour, could he but have heard one step, one bump which might have told him what was going on <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> then above his head, instead of extending his hands towards the girl, he would have done much more wisely if he had grasped in each hand one of the sacks lying on the other scale and made off with it somewhere through that dark corridor which nobody knew of but he himself, under the special protection of the devil. Just now, however, the devil was evidently not looking after him as carefully as usual, for he returned to the altar with the girl in his arms and deposited his load on...", "...I was so terrified at the cowardice which was thus revealed, that I myself began to look upon Tannhauser as doomed. My prospects and my whole position, when viewed in this mood, may be readily gathered from my communications, especially those referring to my negotiations for the publication of my works.

I was afraid to look anybody in the face, but was one day obliged to go to Meser's music shop, where I met Gottfried Semper <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> buying a text-book of Tannhauser. Only a short time before I had been very much put out in discussing this subject with him; he would listen to nothing I had to say about the Minnesangers and Pilgrims of the Middle Ages in connection with art, but gave me to understand that he despised me for my choice of such material. While Meser assured me that no inquiry whatever had been received for the numbers of Tannhauser already published, it was strange that my most energetic...", "...the Columbia and the Lewisburg turnpikes, on the ground over which the Confederates had advanced to attack it in the battle.

The effect was a curiously impressive one as we looked down the line we had held and thought what a level storm of lead was indicated by this long white fringe, and what desperate charges of Hood's divisions they were that came through it, close up to the line of this abatis. Every twig was weeping with the cold pouring rain of the dark midwinter storm, and this did not lessen the gloomy effect of the scene.

Jupiter decides that he will do <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as he pleases about the weather, and everybody goes home satisfied.

In the summer of 1886 MacDowell and his wife again yielded to their passion for travelling and went to London to buy furniture, for they had wearied of living in pensions and hotels and had determined to set up housekeeping. When they returned they hired a little flat in the Jahnstrasse and installed themselves therewith <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> enough furniture to give them countenance. Here Mrs. MacDowell suffered an illness which threatened for a time to bring a tragic termination to their happiness, and through which the hope of a child was lost to them.

The Father answered that in a just war it was lawful for those that had right to wage battle against the enemies of their commonwealth, to authorize their captains or soldiers, as their officers, to annoy or destroy any town that is unjustly holden against them, and that such is the common doctrine of all Divines: in respect that every commonwealth must by...", "...fulfil the high destiny for which it is manifest he was born.

He was fortunate, too, in this, that a triumph so striking occurred <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> before he left the House for another sphere of public life. He had what the actors call a splendid exit. The inauguration of Mr. Monroe on the 4th of March, 1817, ushered in the era of good feeling, and gave to Henry Clay the first of his long series of disappointments.

It has been said that he is \"incapable of writing sustained melody\"; and though <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> how extended a melodic line must be in order to merit the epithet \"sustained\" is not quite clear, it would seem that in this particular scene, at all events, Debussy may be said to have compassed even \"sustained\" melody; for the melodic line--varied, sensitive, and plastic though it is--is here of almost unbroken continuity. In its total aspect as a dramatic commentary the score provokes wonder at its precision and flexibility. The manner in which each scene is individualised,...", "...for Yue Huang.

It is the height of folly for men to attempt to lay down a rule as to the amount or duration of the punishment due to sin. God alone can settle this. And, after all, what was it that produced all the misery and wretchedness, the sickness and sorrow, the death and desolation, of well-nigh six thousand years? Just _one_ act of disobedience--the eating of a forbidden fruit. Can man explain this?

Kate moved closer to Loudon and laid a hand on the neck of his horse. \"Tom,\" she whispered, \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> heard what Block tried to do. Lil told me.

On the day after they took up their place on their cruising ground they fell in with a large polacca brig.

As to those who do believe, it would be difficult to give them or to leave them too much of the marvellous.

For these requirements, or this compound requirement, the hearing of some new thing has been of old recognised as the surest and most generally useful specific. And the novel holds itself out, not indeed always quite truly, as being new or nothing by name and nature. Accordingly the demand for novels has gone on ever increasing, and the supply has never failed to keep up with it. Nor would it be <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> to say that the quality has sunk appreciably. The absolutely palmy day of the English nineteenth century in novel-writing was no doubt some thirty-five or forty years ago. Not even the contemporary France of that date can show such a \"galaxy-gallery\" as the British novelists--Dickens, Thackeray, Miss Bronte, George Eliot, Trollope, Kingsley, Bulwer, Disraeli, Lever, Mr. Meredith, and others--who all wrote in the fifties. But at the beginning of the period the towering genius of...", "...possible into duplicate collections. The pay collection of duplicates in St. Louis varies very much. In three of the branches it has not even been begun, the librarians of these branches reporting that there is no demand for it. In two branches it is very popular and in the central library fairly so. Dr. Hill thought it was not wise to give a smaller number of copies to the public for free use than to the department where pay is requested. It seemed to him that the public should have <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as many copies of a book as those who can afford to pay one or two cents a day. In Brooklyn they give the same number of copies to the free circulating department as to the duplicate pay department. Dr. Hill said the Brooklyn public library last year spent for replacement, juvenile and adult, $50,000 out of the $80,000 which was spent for books, or something like 60 per cent for fiction both new and replacements.

The Rhone, however, had no choice, it was obliged to force, and has forced its way over the cone deposited by the Borgne.

STORY III BUDDY PIGG AND SAMMY LITTLETAIL Getting up quite early one morning, Buddy Pigg washed himself very carefully, so that his black and white fur was fairly shining in the sunlight, and then the little guinea pig started off to take a stroll before breakfast. \"Who knows,\" he said, \"perhaps I may meet with an adventure; or else find a cabbage, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as I did the other day. But if I do, I'm not going to get inside it and go to sleep. No, indeed, and a feather pillow besides!\" So Buddy Pigg walked on, leaving his sister and his mamma and Dr. Pigg slumbering in the pen. Oh, it was just fine, running along through the woods and over the fields that beautiful, summer morning. The grass was all covered with dew, and Buddy had a second bath before he had gone very far, there was so much water on everything, but he didn't mind...", "...in one surge into the height of heaven, until the pine forests lie on its immensity like the shadows of narrow clouds, and the hollow of the other laid league by league into the blue of the air, until its white villages flash in the distance only like the fall of a sunbeam?

We have <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> seen (Sec. 11) that it is impossible for the slope of a mountain, not actually a precipice of rock, to exceed 35 deg. or among secondary 40 deg., and that by far the greater part of all hill-surface is composed of graceful curves of much less degree than this, reaching 40 deg. only as their ultimate and utmost inclination. It must be farther observed that the interruptions to such curves, by precipices or steps, are always small in proportion to the slopes themselves. Precipices...", "...who is trying, for instance, to portray the calmness of a ranch-house kitchen at supper time. There had been days of lowering clouds which brought nothing but exasperating little flurries of what Applehead called \"spit snow,\"--flurries that passed before Luck could get ready for a scene. There had been one terrific sand storm which had nearly caught them in the open. But Applehead had warned them, and Luck, fortunately for them all, had heeded the warning. They had reached shelter <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> before the full force of the storm had struck them, and for six hours the air was a hell of sand in violent flight through the air. For six hours they could not see as far as the stable, and the rooms were filled with an impalpable haze of dust which filtered through minute crevices under the roof and around the doors and windows. Luck, when that storm broke, was worried over his negative drying in the garret, until he had hurried up the ladder to see what might be done. He had...", "...spots and hair-lines of deep brownish red, almost black, and there are a few large pinkish-brown smears and clouds, generally lying round or about the dark spots; and then towards the large end there are several small clouds and patches of faint inky purple, which appear to underlie the other markings.

And if these propositions were carried out, the many thousands of water-birds would be forced to move from this quarter.

He was a young bird, who had only lived one summer, one fall, and a winter; now, it was his first spring. He had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> returned from South Africa, and had reached Takern in such good season that the ice was still on the lake. One evening, when he and the other young wild ducks played at racing backward and forward over the lake, a hunter fired a couple of shots at them, and Jarro was wounded in the breast. He thought he should die; but in order that the one who had shot him shouldn't get him into his power, he continued to fly as long as he possibly could.

In the rock where the fissure ends at Revaillon is an opening like a vast yawning mouth, the roof of which forms an almost perfect dome. Adown this a stream trickles towards the end of summer, but plunges madly and with a frightful roar in winter and spring.

When he sees something happen in the street, he will not be satisfied, like the casual looker-on, merely with that solitary happening; he will try to find out what other happenings led up to it, and again what other happenings must logically follow from it. When he sees an interesting person in a street-car, he will wonder where that person has come from and whither he is going, what he has <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> done and what he is about to do; he will look before and after, and pine for what is not. This exercise is in itself interesting; and if the result of it be written down, the young author will gain experience in expression at the same time that he is developing his sense of narrative.

Every event has three elements: the thing that is done, the agents that do it, and the circumstances of time...", "...all night. As the door closed behind the two ministers, Bonaparte threw himself back in his chair, his arms folded across his breast, his head drooping forward, in an attitude of deep thought. It seemed to me more than likely that Minister Decres's words had touched his pride and his patriotism, and he was hesitating now at the thought of getting rid of France's last important colony. He was interrupted in his reverie by an officer bringing in the despatches from London which had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> arrived, and he sent word by the officer to have Minister Marbois sent to him immediately. It was only a few moments until the return of my uncle, but in the interval I could see that Bonaparte was glancing through the despatches with such lightning rapidity that to me, for whom all reading is slow work, it seemed impossible he should have grasped their meaning. As Monsieur Marbois entered the apartment Bonaparte greeted him. \"Citizen Minister,\" he said, \"the despatches from...", "...the corners must be shaved off. Surely no artist ever existed who evaded being comfortably fitted into either a square or a round hole more completely than did Leighton. Every serious work he undertook was an entirely separate performance from any previous invention--a new venture throughout--and, once decided on, carried through with absolute conformity to the original conception. Therefore any classification, beyond his mere method of working, is more sterile in producing a <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> estimate of Leighton's art than of those workers who are in the habit of painting pictures in which the same motive recurs. Essentially original in his conceptions as in his aims, and vibrating with receptiveness, he sounded nevertheless every impression he received by unchanging principles adhered to as implicit guides.

After awhile I wanted wood, and going up to the dead line with an ax on my shoulder, I got permission from the guard to step over to a tree top that lay <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> at their feet to supply myself. They thought, I suppose, that I would not attempt to get off, and they allowed me this small privilege; I had struck but few blows with the ax before they turned their heads to watch the other prisoners; and as that was my only chance, I was off at once, and made the best time I ever did.

The confidence you express for the future and satisfaction with the past in my military administration is acknowledged with pride. It will be my earnest endeavor that you and the country shall not be disappointed.

He has scented us out! We can't get a minute's peace. Let us hide behind the balustrade.

The Cat, when she saw him, turned away in disgust: \"He has put on the livery of one of the footmen of Cinderella's coach.... It is <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> the thing for him: he has the soul of a flunkey!\" She ended these words with a \"Fft! Fft!\" and, stroking her whiskers, took up her stand, with a defiant air, between Sugar and Fire. The good Dog did not see her little game. He was wholly wrapped up in the pleasure of being gorgeously arrayed; and he danced round and round.

The soldier was standing at the open door of the apartment, looking in with a suspicious eye on the supposed British officer. On observing his lieutenant, he fell back with habitual respect; and replied, with an air of puzzled thought: \"I don't know, sir, but <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> now the prisoner looked queer.

Then she went on with playful austerity: \"Now you are to do exactly what you were meaning to do when you didn't know we were coming with you. I'll make them all stay away from you <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as long as I can.\" She kept her promise so well that for an industrious hour Lidgerwood scarcely realized that he was not alone.

He could not sleep and after the others had retired took a long walk, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> to settle his nerves. Dick's walk brought him to the lot where the circus had held forth, and for some time he watched the men as they worked under the flaring gasoline torches, packing up what still remained on the grounds.

Peter's wound also was deep and wide, though his shield had broken the weight of Morella's sword, and its edge had caught upon his shoulder-piece, so that by good chance it...", "...frankness which ever marked her character, she describes the strange fluttering of her heart, the embarrassment, the attraction, and the instinctive diffidence she experienced when in the presence of a young man who had, all unconsciously, interested her affections. It seems that there was a youthful painter named Taboral, of pale, and pensive, and intellectual countenance--an artist with soul-inspired enthusiasm beaming from his eye--who occasionally called upon her father. Jane had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> been reading the Heloise of Rousseau, that gushing fountain of sentimentality. Her young heart took fire. His features mingled insensibly in her dreamings and her visions, and dwelt, a welcome guest, in her castles in the air. The diffident young man, with all the sensitiveness of genius, could not speak to the daughter, of whose accomplishments the father was so justly proud, without blushing like a girl. When Jane heard him in the shop, she always contrived to make some errand...", "...Camille and Gerard were concerned that flitted by most visibly across the faces of all three of them: that hateful rivalry of mother and daughter, contending for the man they loved. And, meantime, the silver-gilt blades of the dessert-knives were delicately peeling choice fruit. And there were bunches of golden grapes looking beautifully fresh, and a procession of sweetmeats, little cakes, an infinity of dainties, over which the most satiated appetites lingered complacently. Then, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as the finger-glasses were being served, a footman came and bent over the Baroness, who answered in an undertone, \"Well, show him into the _salon_, I will join him there.\" And aloud to the others she added: \"It's Monsieur l'Abbe Froment, who has called and asks most particularly to see me. He won't be in our way; I think that almost all of you know him. Oh! he's a genuine saint, and I have much sympathy for him.\" For a few minutes longer they loitered round the table, and then...", "...and as he heard his voice Charlie thought to himself that one of the first steps he would take towards turning over a new leaf would be to break with Mr Bill, so he answered him rather shortly, and told him that he had better mind his own business. \"That's it, quarrel with an old chum, I suppose. I ain't good enough for you now you've got to know the old General. I don't know what's come over you: you can't take a joke, you never go on the spree, and you put on no end of frills <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> because you know that poverty-stricken old dead-beat and his daughter,\" Jeffson growled out as he got up, stretched himself, and lounged into the claim, while Charlie settled down at the sorting-table. Several hours had passed without anything happening to vary the dull monotony of the work, when Charlie suddenly sprang up with an exclamation of surprise. \"Hullo! what's up? Have you found one?\" Jeffson called out. \"Found one! no. I heard some one cry out; there it is...", "...*Mrs. OSWALD. No. The only persons he mentioned were the Cuban Embassy and the Soviet Embassy in Mexico. Senator RUSSELL. Now, going back to your personal relations, Mrs. Oswald, with Lee.

This is the question that I am puzzled about and I am wondering about it myself, whether he wanted to get rid of me. Senator RUSSELL. Do you think he was really devoted to the children or was he <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> putting on a show about liking the children?* *Mrs. OSWALD. Yes; he loved the children. *I believe he loved the children, but at times--one side of his life was such that I wondered whether he did or not. Some of the things that he did certainly were not good for his children--some of the acts he was engaged in. Senator RUSSELL. He knew you would take the children back to Russia with you, if you wanted, did he not?* *Mrs. OSWALD. Of course I would have taken the children...", "...after years Mrs. Moulton smilingly replied to some questions regarding her initiation into authorship: \"I remember the huge posters with which they placarded the walls, headed, 'Read this book and see what a girl of eighteen can do.' I think I had the grace to be a little shocked at these posters, but the reviews were so kind, and said such lovely things that--Ah! shall I ever be so happy again as when I read them!\" Edmund Clarence Stedman, who had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> left Yale College and who, at the beginning of his literary career, was editing a country paper in Connecticut, greeted Miss Chandler's book with the ardent praise of youth and friendship; but these warm phrases of approval were also the almost unanimous expression of all the reviewers of the day. The twentieth century reader may smile at Mr. Stedman's youthful distrust of the \"strong-minded woman,\" but his remarks are interesting. Of \"This, That, and the Other,\" he wrote:...", "...person? She knew her master's habits--she knew the surroundings--she knew where Harborough kept that cord--she is the sort of person who could steal about as quietly as a cat.

You can run faster than I; so that's settled.\" \"Don't be absurd, dear,\" answered Barbara; \"I am not afraid of bulls.\" Lady Casterley flashed a look at her which had a gleam of amusement. \"I can feel you,\" she said; \"you're <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as trembly as I am.\" The bull was now distant some eighty yards, and they were still quite a hundred from the stile. \"Granny,\" said Barbara, \"if you don't go on as I tell you, I shall just leave you, and go and meet him!

She passed for a witch, I think; and when she died--I was eight years old then--old people put their heads together, and told strange stories about her early life. It seems that this Molly Slater was away in service at Bollington, a village half way between our place and Hillsborough, and her fellow-servants used to quiz her because she had no sweetheart. At last, she told them to wait till next Hilisboro' fair, and they should see. And <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> before the fair, she reminded them of their sneers, and said she would not come home without a sweetheart, though she took the Evil one himself. For all that, she did leave the fair alone. But, as she trudged home in the dark, a man overtook her, and made acquaintance with her. He was a pleasant fellow, and told her his name was William Easton. Of course she could not see his face very well, but he had a wonderfully sweet voice. After that night, he used to court her, and sing to...", "...Mrs Colclough's part. She amiably smiled as she perused the GAZETTE'S version of Fuge's version of the lake episode. Here was the attitude of the woman whose soul is like crystal. It seems to me that most women would have blushed, or dissented, or simulated anger, or failed to conceal vanity. But Mrs Coclough might have been reading a fairy tale, for any emotion she displayed. 'Yes,' she said blandly; 'from the things Annie used to tell me about him sometimes, I should say that was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> how he WOULD talk. They seem to have thought quite a lot of him in London, then?' 'Oh, rather!' I said. 'I suppose your sister knew him pretty well?' 'Annie? I don't know. She knew him.' I distinctly observed a certain self-consciousness in Mrs Colclough as she made this reply. Mrs Brindley had risen and with wifely attentiveness was turning over the music page for her husband.

I improvised a costume and did the song and dance for her that I am going to give in the French Relief entertainment next week. And I made a blueberry pie for dinner, and set the little kitchen in shining order, and put fresh bows on her cap, and straightened out all the bureau drawers. When everything you do is appreciated and admired and praised until you are fairly basking in approval, it makes you feel so good inside that you want to keep on that way forever. You <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> _love_ to be sweet and considerate. But afterwards it's such a comedown to go back home to those who take it as a matter of course that you should be helpful, and who feel it is their duty to improve your character by telling you what _your_ duty is. It rubs you the wrong way, and makes life much harder. Somehow, going to Fishburn Court is like climbing up into the Pilgrim monument and looking down on the town. Seen from that height, the things that loomed up so big when you...", "...as another vast swell of water came rolling along, shaking its white curled mane, like a sea-monster bent on destruction. \"Monty, it's no use,\" said Eric, hastily tearing off his jacket and waistcoat; \"I'm not going to let Russell die on that ledge of rock.

In another minute he was on the ledge by Russell's...", "...of knocking. She looked in the direction from which it came and saw Androvsky standing before the priest's door. As she looked, the door was opened by the Arab boy and Androvsky went in. Then she did not think of the gardens any more.

At first she did not pray, or even think consciously, but <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> rested in the attitude which always seems to bring humanity nearest its God. And, almost immediately, she began to feel a quietude of spirit, as if something delicate descended upon her, and lay lightly about her, shrouding her from the troubles of the world.

If it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves constitute a distinction which overturns what has <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> been said on the strict affinity of metrical language with that of prose, and paves the way for other artificial distinctions which the mind voluntarily admits, I answer that the language of such Poetry as is here recommended is, as far as is possible, a selection of the language really spoken by men; that this selection, wherever it is made with true taste and feeling, will of itself form a distinction far greater than would at first be imagined, and will entirely separate the...", "...his hand to his brow as if in pain and perplexity, and began again to walk backward and forward.

The Declaration was framed for a highly...", "...to say, \"This he never could have done.\" Enough remains from among his early efforts to accredit whatever mournful witness may now be borne of him. But what can be a nobler tribute than this, that for seventeen years after his death a poet, fast rising towards the lofty summits of his art, found that young fading image the richest source of his inspiration, and of thoughts that gave him buoyancy for a flight such as he had not hitherto attained? It would be very difficult to convey a <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> idea of this volume either by narrative or by quotation. In the series of monodies or meditations which compose it, and which follow in long series without weariness or sameness, the poet never moves away a step from the grave of his friend, but, while circling round it, has always a new point of view. Strength of love, depth of grief, aching sense of loss, have driven him forth as it were on a quest of consolation, and he asks it of nature, thought, religion, in a hundred forms...", "...Dent tells me as you'll soon be wed, and that never may I call you wife o' mine.

Kneeling over his parent, Dick set to work to resuscitate the almost drowned man.

His treatment was as skillful as memory and his love for his parent could make it, and in less than half an hour he had the satisfaction of seeing his father give a gasp and open his eyes. \"Father, don't you know me?\" \"Dick!\" came the almost inaudible reply. \"Where--where am I?\" \"You are safe, father.

Jan mentioned this to the groundcar radio. \"That's the third time in half an hour,\" he commented. \"The place tosses like the IJsselmeer on a rough day.\" \"You <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> don't forget it _isn't_ the Zuider Zee,\" retorted Heemskerk from the other end. \"You sink there and you don't come up three times.\" \"Don't worry,\" said Jan. \"I'll be back on time, with a broom at the masthead.\" \"This I shall want to see,\" chuckled Heemskerk; a logical reaction, considering the scarcity of brooms on Venus. * * * * * Two hours earlier the two men had sat across a small table playing chess, with little indication there would be...", "...our two lives; though, for my part, I must own I only swallowed it to please papa, whose eye was upon my plate. In the afternoon we walked up to the moor together, and papa was charmed because we \"put up\" quite a number of birds.

A horrid nuisance, her coming! I do wish it had not been <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> yet. By-the-bye, papa tells me he has heard from Mr. Miles, who, after all, has not yet left England, his business having turned out different from what he expected. Then how strange that we have never heard from him all these weeks! I quite thought he would be out there by this time. However, he says he really does sail in a few days, and he only wishes he saw his way to running down to say good-bye to us--but that will be impossible. I believe papa has written to him, telling...", "...should he not reign there? What was there to prevent him moving at the height of civic glory? The kingdoms of the world--his world--were spread before him, and the glory of them, and he was eager to inherit them. Lord Mayor of London, Member of Parliament for the city, knighthood, baronetcy--so ran his dream, and he knew that it was not a foolish dream. Men less able than himself had won these prizes. And he meant to have them in good time. The truly great period of his life was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> beginning. He had got the world beneath his feet at last, and he meant to keep it there. Extreme prosperity had had a softening influence upon the man; a harsh critic might have called it a disintegrating influence.

The scene between him and the infuriated Vekeel was a painful one even for the attendants who stood round; and Orion, who heard Obada's raging from the adjoining room, could gather from it some idea of the relentless hatred with which his negro enemy would persecute him.

The spirit of the new philosophy had a chance to speak out there for once, without intending, of course, to transcend that particular limit <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> laid down, namely, the measure of _verses_, and with that literal limitation, to the form of the verse, the remark is sufficiently suggestive; for he brings out from it at the next step, in the way of formula, the new principle, the new Shaksperian principle of rhetoric: _In these things_ the sense is better judge than the art.

In spite of all that has been said, I maintain that sovereignty is in its nature indivisible. It is the supreme power in a State, and we might <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as well speak of half a square, or half of a triangle, as of half a sovereignty. It is a gross error to confound the *exercise* of sovereign powers with *sovereignty* itself, or the *delegation* of such powers with the *surrender* of them.

His own mind alone has power to give him a momentary relief. Herein lies one of the strongest problems of human nature.

Dan Davis, though fairly doubled up with laughter, sprang from his donkey and ran to Sam's assistance. He did not fear that Sam would be harmed, but he saw that, with every kick, the animal was getting nearer and nearer to the bazaar. \"Hang on, Sam!\" encouraged his companions. \"Sprinkle some salt on the donkey's tail,\" suggested another. Dan leaped to the donkey's head. Instantly the animal whirled. Dan, seeing what was about to occur, threw himself forward <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as the hind hoofs of the animal shot out, the boy falling against the donkey's legs and hips. The Battleship Boy was lifted right up into the air. He landed in a heap some fifteen feet away. The jackies yelled themselves hoarse, while Dan got up, rubbing himself and grinning sheepishly. A crash at that instant attracted their attention to the bazaar. Mr. Donkey, with the red-headed boy's arms wrapped about its neck, had bolted into the bazaar. [Illustration: Sam and the...", "...XV.

The rest of us were conversing in a more or less distrait fashion till this unpleasant duty should be finished, when he took an electric torch from his pocket and flashed it on one of the bills; then on another, and so through the lot. Hesitatingly he touched Monsieur's arm, asking: \"Is this the money you won last night?\" \"That? It is <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as they paid me.\" A moment of silence, then: \"I'm sorry to tell you, but these two fifty-dollar bills are counterfeits.\" There ensued an absolute hush, and before my eyes arose the vision of Sylvia's father paying his supper check with a crisp fifty. \"Counterfeit,\" the professor mused, putting out a hand for them and moving nearer the light. \"Strange!

Her mother's eyes were anxious, and there was a warning in the look she gave the girl. \"My dear, you would not find him compliant if you wished to marry a man he did not approve of.\" Beatrice stooped to flick an imaginary piece of lint off of her skirt.

And he went contentedly off to sleep. Out of the chaos of noise and the uncertain light a big tall doctor man came striding across the grass to them, dressed in a long white operating coat which he had forgotten to throw off. Augusta rose to her knees and to her overstrained senses the tall white figure advancing upon her must have taken on some kind of a supernatural appearance. We do not know <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> what was in her mind, probably it is not important. But she raised her hand in a foolish little salute, and said, somewhat apologetically, to the doctor: \"If you please, God, we've changed our mind. We'd much rather live.\" Then she slid quietly down in a faint beside Jimmie. To this day that surgeon thinks that he did not hear correctly.

When we knew you were coming, your father and I, we used to laugh because you see, I had so many names and a title too--and I'd run away from everything <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> to be with Felix and I'd no way to get at what I owned without going back to Grandy. Besides it seemed to me that what I owned had made all of us unhappy. So we used to say all we'd give you would be the names and the titles but we'd keep you away from the rest of it--and that we were glad the days of princesses were gone for both our countries, America and France.

Arni ended by feeling quite tenderly towards the fox. He hardly knew how to give utterance to his joy.

SIR,--I have <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> had sent to me from London a copy of the Pall Mall Gazette, containing a review of my book A House of Pomegranates. {163} The writer of this review makes a certain suggestion which I beg you will allow me to correct at once. He starts by asking an extremely silly question, and that is, whether or not I have written this book for the purpose of giving pleasure to the British child. Having expressed grave doubts on this subject, a subject on which I cannot conceive any fairly...", "...read them slowly and deliberately, sometimes turning back a page and going over a part of it again. When she finished, she glanced at Nancy Ellen while slowly folding the sheets. \"Just for half a cent I'd ask you to read this,\" she said. \"I certainly shan't pay anything for the privilege, but I'll read it, if you want me to,\" offered Nancy Ellen. \"All right, go ahead,\" said Kate. \"It might possibly teach you that you can't always judge a man by appearance, or hastily; though <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> why George Holt looks more like a 'clod-hopper' than Adam, or Hiram, or Andrew, it passes me to tell.\" She handed Nancy Ellen the letter and slowly ripped open the flap of the heavy white envelope. She drew forth the sheet and sat an instant with it in her fingers, watching the expression of Nancy Ellen's face, while she read the most restrained yet impassioned plea that a man of George Holt's nature and opportunities could devise to make to a woman after having spent several...", "...intervals. The spectator thought he kept it directed to the girls' boat, chiefly, if not exclusively. He thought also that the opera-glass was more particularly pointed towards the bow of the boat, and came to the natural conclusion that the bow oar, Miss Euthymia Tower, captain of the Atalantas, \"The Wonder\" of the Corinna Institute, was the attraction which determined the direction of the instrument. \"Who is that in the canoe over there?\" asked the owner of the spy-glass. \"That's <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> what we should like to know,\" answered the old landlord's wife. \"He and his man boarded with us when they first came, but we could never find out anything about him only just his name and his ways of living. His name is Kirkwood, Maurice Kirkwood, Esq., it used to come on his letters. As for his ways of living, he was the solitariest human being that I ever came across. His man carried his meals up to him. He used to stay in his room pretty much all day, but at night he would be...", "...Yes; there she stood, old Aunt Nemesis, glaring at me from behind her spectacles. I decided to die without going over near the piano. \"Where are they?\" I could hear Aunt Martha asking in the same tone of voice I was certain the Roman Emperor used when just about to frame up a finale for a few Christians from over the Tiber. \"Uncle Peter has gone for them; we put them in the spare room,\" answered Clara J. \"What! _in the spare room_!\" gasped Aunt Martha, collapsing in a chair <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as Uncle Peter appeared in the doorway, bowing low before the visitors, who stalked clumsily into the parlor. For some reason or other Clara J. omitted the formality of springing forward and greeting my relatives effusively, so she simply said, \"You are very welcome, Aunt Eliza and cousin Julia!\" \"Great heavens! what does this mean?\" shrieked Aunt Martha. \"It cannot be possible that these two women are relatives of yours, John! Why, I engaged them both in an intelligence...", "...think that it is worth something. What I can do for you does not go beyond hospitality, but to that you are heartily welcome. You have some hours before you. If you start an hour after sunset you will be in ample time. And, in fact, you had better not start before, because the less that is seen of your movements the better. I don't know that any of the people about here are infected with the Druid superstition, though I have had one or two hints to that effect, hints which what you have <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> told me helps to explain. But, in any case, the more secret you are the better. Besides, my son's Party cannot reach the Great Temple till long after dark. Meanwhile take some rest and refreshment, for, believe me, you have something before you.\" This advice was so obviously right, that the guide, who was in command of the party, had no hesitation in accepting it. About six o'clock another start was made. At first, though the weather looked threatening, no serious obstacle...", "...serve for our Christmas number?\" \"I will have it copied out and send it for you to look at,\" said Allen. \"If it is at hand, I had better cast my eye over it, to judge whether it be worth while to copy it. I shall set forth on my holiday journey the day after to-morrow, and I should like to have my mind at rest about my Christmas number.\" So she carried off with her the Algerine number of the \"Joy,\" and in a couple of days returned it with a hasty note-- \"A capital little story, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> young and sentimental enough to make it taking, and not overdone. Please let me have it, with a few verbal corrections, ready for the press when I come home at the end of September. It will bring you in about L15.\" Allen was modestly elated, and only wished he had gone to one of the periodicals more widely circulated. It was plain that literature was his vocation, and he was going to write a novel to be published in a serial, the instalments paying his expenses for the trial....", "...be fought with; He's a problem to be solved.

Nobody in this cabin--you, nor me, nor your ma, would steal anything. Your ma's sick and don't know what she's doing, but she don't mean no real harm. I guess she ain't been treated right, and she feels upset about it, but a boy don't want, ever, to say anything bad about his ma.\" He went out and closed and locked the door. Involuntarily he glanced at Widow Potter's chimneys. No smoke came from any of them. \"Now, I just bet that woman has gone and got sick, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> when I've got my hands plumb full!\" he said disgustedly. \"I've got to go up and see what's the matter with her, or she might lie there and die and nobody know a thing about it.\" The cold had frozen the slush into hardness, and Peter cut across the corn-field. He tried Mrs. Potter's doors and found them all locked--which was a bad sign, unless she had gone to town while he was in the shanty-boat--but he knocked on the kitchen door noisily, and was rewarded after a reasonable...", "...come nearer and nearer, and the loud-mouthed chorus of the dogs in one incessant clamour which is never suffered to die, so quickly is it taken up by fresh throats, rings from the steep hillsides as the rout sweeps down the kloof.

It is a young bushbuck ram, and as it crosses the open Claverton waits till it has <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> passed him and fires. It is scarcely twenty-five yards from him, yet it is unharmed, and disappears in the opposite cover with a rush and a bound. Claverton shakes his head and whistles softly. \"_What_ a shot!\" he says. Then he looks up and catches sight of Will Jeffreys watching him with a sneering smile upon his face, and the sight angers him for a moment. \"Look out--look out, Arthur,\" sounds Jim's voice close at hand. \"There's a buck coming out, right at you.\" He...", "...he were actually present and visible. While President Kimball was very strict in his family, he was ever kind and tender towards them. I sometimes thought he was even kinder to me than to his own boys. I have heard him reprove them, but no word of reproof ever fell from his lips upon me. Later, through him, I was sent on my first mission. No better or kinder thing was ever done for me. It gave me four years of experience and seasoning which fixed my whole course of life, and it came <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> at the right time to the boy that I was. Later I was associated with him in the Endowment House, where I served with him and under his direction for years. This brought me into the most intimate relation with him, and gave to each of us the most complete and perfect opportunity of becoming thoroughly acquainted with each other. I learned to love him with the truest love, and the many evidences of his love and confidences in me are beyond all question. My latest recollections...", "...you want,\" said the sea witch; \"it is very stupid of you, but you shall have your way, and it will bring you to sorrow, my pretty princess. You want to get rid of your fish's tail, and to have two supports instead of it, like human beings on earth, so that the young prince may fall in love with you, and that you may have an immortal soul.\" And then the witch laughed so loud and disgustingly, that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground, and lay there wriggling about. \"You are but <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> in time,\" said the witch; \"for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able to help you till the end of another year. I will prepare a draught for you, with which you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise, and sit down on the shore and drink it. Your tail will then disappear, and shrink up into what mankind calls legs, and you will feel great pain, as if a sword were passing through you. But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw....", "...closely resembles that of the glove on the table.\" Mervyn, who had not been listening to the last part of the constable's evidence, turned round upon being spoken to. \"My glove, yes, here it is. What do you want it for?\" The coroner took the glove and laid it by the other. Colour and stitching matched exactly; there could be no doubt but that they were a pair. A smothered exclamation broke from almost every man in the room. \"What is it?\" Ronald Mervyn asked. \"The constable has <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> testified, Captain Mervyn, that he found this glove a few feet from the window of the deceased. No doubt you can account for its being there, but until the matter is explained it has, of course, a somewhat serious aspect, coupled with the evidence of Lieutenant Gulston.\" Again Ronald Mervyn whitened to the hair. \"Do I understand, sir,\" he said in a low voice, \"that I am accused of the murder of my cousin?\" \"No one is at present accused,\" the coroner said, quietly. \"We are...", "...face, so suddenly and sharply revealed, an unmasked aspect as she turned from Cora to him.

They had been in California for their honeymoon, and had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> returned to Freeport. Amy was not a Freeport girl, and was new to his old crowd, which the visit of Cora Albright was bringing together in various little reunions. She had been sitting over at the far side of the group, talking with Will Blair, Edith's husband. Now they too had stopped talking. \"She wanted to know about her father,\" he added. No one said anything. That irritated him. It seemed that Edith or her mother, now that Cora had opened it up, might make some little...", "...near them her hat and veil, the one glove she had had on, and the heap of jewelry. All those fine garments and the precious stones worth a fortune seemed so pitiful and useless now. We were awful silent at first, a crowd of people sitting along the walls, staring straight ahead or looking on the ground. Now and then someone would move uneasily and make a rustle, but there were moments so still you could hear the fire snapping and the scratching of the reporters' pencils. They were <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> behind me, bunched up at a table in front of the window. When the Doctor came in everyone was as quiet as death and the eyes on him were like the eyes of images, so fixed and steady. Mrs. Fowler was not present--they sent for her later--but Nora and Anne were there as pale as ghosts. The Coroner opened up by telling about how and where the deceased had been found, the position, the surroundings, etc., etc., and then called Dr. Graham, who was the county physician and had made...", "...and swiftly--not the shallow, panting breath of a runner, but deep and full, yet faster than I can breathe. I could hear him breathing in spite of all the noise of the battle.\" \"I noticed it,\" Arcot said. \"He started breathing _before_ the fight started. A human being can fight very swiftly, and with tremendous vigor, for ten seconds, putting forth his best effort, and only breathe once or twice. For another two minutes, he breathes more heavily than usual. But after that, he can't <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> slow down back to normal. He has used up the surplus oxygen in his system, and that has to be replaced; he has run into 'oxygen debt'. He has to keep on breathing hard to get back the oxygen surplus his body requires. \"But not Torlos! No fatigue for him! Why? _Because he doesn't use the oxygen of the air to do work, and therefore his body is not a chemical engine!_\" Morey nodded slowly. \"I see what you're driving at. His body uses the heat energy of the air! His muscles turn...", "...and I love you, and every instinct of my nature drives me to you; for me to live with you without kissing you or putting my arms about you, will remain always difficult. It will be so for you, as for me, and it will always be our danger, and always make us wretched. Your soul rises in you as I write this, and you say (as you've said before) that if I offered to kiss you after it, it would be an insult. But only wait until we meet! This is the one thing that has become clear to me: <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as soon as there comes the least thought of satisfaction in our love, just so soon does it cease to satisfy my best self. You cannot satisfy my best self, you do not even know it; and if it were a question of that, I should never dream of marrying you! I love you for this and for this alone--because you are an undeveloped soul, the dream of whose infinite possibilities is my one delight in the matter.

His house and a small one adjoining for pigs and poultry were built for him by the governor, who also gave him two sows and seven fowls, to which he adds a little stock...", "...words Locasto changed his tune. He became alarmed to the point of terror. He knew the hand was doomed. He lay staring at it, staring, staring.

He cut the skin of the wrist <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> above the gangrene line, and raised it up an inch or so. It was here Locasto showed wonderful nerve. He took a large bite of tobacco and chewed steadily, while his keen black eyes watched every move of the knife. \"Hurry up and get the cursed thing off,\" he snarled. The Halfbreed nicked the flesh down to the bone, then with the ragged jack-knife he began to saw. I could not bear to look. It made me deathly sick. I heard the grit, grit of the jagged blade.

He turned away from them with a long sigh. \"Nope,\" he said. \"Much obliged. I'll send my man up to-morrow. Business keeps a-goin' on just the same, no matter who passes out. If you or me died to-night, the whole world would <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> keep joggin' along.

Then slowly we commenced navigating the tortuous coast, first bearing eastwardly across the bay, and then following up the shore line as far as the Norwegian isles, a reef of rocky keys off the northwest coast. Here we took careful bearings; made allowances for the rather singular behavior of the compass, and then heading the ship due north, bore away upon our course. I felt as if I were about to sail over the face of an unknown planet, and in a great measure, it was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> this that we were destined to accomplish. I was fully alive to the terrors of that mysterious, strangely isolated quarter of our globe, where it seemed as if the Almighty had set his ban against man's advance, by encircling it with an impenetrable barrier, to cross which, every effort, of which history holds any record, was fruitless.

The propeller is caused to revolve by a steam-engine, steam-turbine, or gasolene-engine, as shown in Fig. 35. Longer boats have more than one propeller. A boat that has two propellers is called a twin-screw boat. A boat driven with four propellers is called a quadruple-screw boat. When a machine screw is turned around <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> once, it moves forward a certain distance, as a glance at Fig. 36 will show. The distance the screw moves forward will depend entirely upon the distance between the threads. The distance between the threads is called the pitch of the thread. If the threads are 1/32 inch apart, then the screw will move 1/32 inch every time it revolves. If a propeller acts in the same way as a screw, then it too must have a pitch.

But as a matter of fact Paul was not indifferent to ordinary information about men in general. On the contrary, he was exceedingly careful about getting information <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as accurate as could possibly be secured.

Folding his arms, and grinning impudently at the astounded cordon of faces, Roke drawled: \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> dropped in to say 'Howdy' to Mr. Standish. Nobody was around.

Mrs. Waycroft came along the stony hill-side road that slanted gently down from her house to Ann Boyd's.

Then Molly was the only one who dared to resist him. \"I may kiss him,\" she would say proudly, as she threw her arms round his neck; she was vain of her power over Anthony, for he would submit quietly and think nothing of it.

Victor glanced at the ground and behold! there lay a stout cudgel, newly cut. He seized it and took up his position. \"You or I!\" he shouted. \"Come on! One--two--three!\" The fight began. The bull backed like a steam-boat, smoke came through its...", "...opportunity of discovery. I went in, therefore, as had been agreed; and upon mentioning the name of Youwarkee, my father fetched a deep sigh and turned away from me in tears. At that instant Hallycarnie came in as by accident.

I shall speak afterwards of other medicines, which may in various circumstances be given, to act upon the bowels; but the above include all that are at all fit for common use in the nursery. Before leaving this subject I will add a word or two about the use of suppositories and lavements in infancy and childhood. A piece of paper rolled up into a conical form and greased, or a bit of soap, is not infrequently introduced by nurses <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> within the bowel, as a means of overcoming constipation in infants. The irritation of the muscle at its orifice (the sphincter, as it is termed) excites the bowels to action, and does away with the necessity for giving an aperient. The drawback from this, as well as from the use of the lavement, is that if frequently employed they become habitually necessary, and the bowels will then never act without their customary stimulus. The lavement, too, has the additional disadvantage...", "...the people in these ancient times hears no more than a confused murmur: one sees a swarm working like ants; a bell rings: they knock off work; another bell: they run together; they shout; they wave their hats; the listener, however, hears no words. It is difficult in any age--even in the present day--to learn or understand what the _bas peuple_ think and what they desire. They want few things indeed in every generation; only, as I said above, the three elements of freedom, health, and <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> pay. Give them these three and they will grumble no longer. When a poet puts one of them on his stage and makes him act and makes him speak, we learn the multitude from the type. Later on, after Chaucer and Piers Ploughman have spoken, we know the people better; as yet we guess at them, we do not even know them in part. Observe, however, one thing about London--a thing of great significance. When there is a Jacquerie, when the people, who have hitherto been as silent as the...", "...that his arms fell to his sides and he gazed at me as if he had lost his senses. I took advantage of this pause to make for the door, but before I could escape, he seized me by the arm and hurled me back into the room, and then with blood-shot eyes and bull-like voice he cursed and cursed. My mother, fearing the effect of his terrible rage, tried to intercede, but he pushed her aside, shouting, 'Oh, she's the daughter of her mother all right, and she'll turn out to be a damned ---- <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> like you!' \"He then came up to me, where I was standing really expecting my death, and to my surprise only pressed his fist gently against my head saying: 'See how easily I could crush you.

He was wondering if he were dreaming, so sudden and unexpected was the announcement of the disaster. When he halted at the bluff, the clerk was still discussing the affair with one of the troopers. As yet the other two were in their places of concealment, and were in ignorance of what had happened. \"It's dead right,\" the clerk said, in answer to Horrocks's sharply-put inquiry. \"I'd been in bed sometime when I was awakened by a terrible racket going on in the office. It's <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> under the room I sleep in. Well, I hopped out of bed and slipped on some clothes, and went downstairs, thinking the governor had been taken with a fit or something. When I got down the office was in darkness, and quiet as death. I went cautiously to work, for I was a bit scared. Striking a light I made my way in, expecting to find the governor laid out, but, instead, I found the furniture all chucked about and the room empty.

It uses water-power, and the beautiful mill-pond behind its high dam keeps the river full back to the rapids <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> above my own acre. In winter this is the favorite skating-pond of the town and of Smith College. In the greener seasons of college terms the girls constantly pass upstream and down in their pretty rowboats and canoes, making a charming effect as seen from my lawn's rear edge at the head of the pine and oak shaded ravine whose fish-pools are gay by turns with elder, wild sunflower, sumach, iris, water-lilies, and forget-me-not.

But here a sudden movement of his, a shifting of his place so that he sat <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> a little nearer her, made her look up. At the same moment she saw that he flung away the cigarette he had only just lit. Then she looked at his face, and saw that his mouth was a little open, and that his breath came quickly. And she knew the moment she had feared a month ago, but had allowed herself to think of as averted, hovered close to her. \"And has my presence made any difference to you?\" he asked. Joyce knew the futility of fencing, as everybody does who knows a crisis...", "...I did.

For a moment I thought he was going to; if he had I don't know what I should have done, said things for which I might have been sorry later on, probably. But he did not laugh.

It was with the utmost trepidation that she heard the key turn in the lock, and beheld Ruth enter the cell with the evening meal. Closing the door, and setting down the provisions, the jailer's daughter hastily divested herself of her dress, which was of brown serge, as well as of her coif and kerchief, while Viviana imitated her example. Without pausing to attire herself in the other's garments, Ruth then assisted Viviana to put on the dress she had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> laid aside, and arranged her hair and the head-gear so skilfully, that the disguise was complete. Hastily whispering some further instructions to her, and explaining certain peculiarities in her gait and deportment, she then pressed her to her bosom, and led her to the door. Viviana would have remonstrated, but Ruth pushed her through it, and closed it. There was now no help, so Viviana, though with great pain to herself, contrived to turn the key in the lock.

Among Republican members of Congress and abolitionists, there was serious discussion of a Fourteenth Amendment to extend to the Negro civil rights and the ballot. Susan, reading about this in Kansas, and Mrs. Stanton, discussing it in New York with her husband, Wendell Phillips, and Robert Dale Owen, saw in such a revision of the Constitution a <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> and logical opportunity to extend woman's rights at the same time. Previously committed to state action on woman suffrage but only because it had then seemed the necessary first step, both women welcomed the more direct road offered by an amendment to the Constitution. Only they of all the old woman's rights workers were awake to this opportunity. Throughout the United States, people were thinking about the Constitution as Americans had not done since the Bill of Rights was...", "...in the soil over there under that tree.

A thousand little birds, awakened by the recurring daylight, chirped and sang and preened their feathers in the freshness of those early hours.

The Turks made several attempts to recapture their lost ground, but all were unsuccessful.

I remember I had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> a vision of those brown wrestling bodies half-bared by the fury of their clutches, and I could hear the quickly drawn pants which came at a supreme moment, when there was a sharp report, which sounded a little muffled, a piece of plaster flew out of the wall behind the two, and some biting smoke bit one's nostrils.

The mule kicked at him, but Tom dodged, and, receiving the letter, hurried behind a pine-tree, and, seating himself on a rock, opened it.

Of course, he didn't think just that. The fact is, he didn't know just what he did think. Here were the springs bubbling away just as they always had.

And yet down on the Green Meadows on the other side of the Green Forest there was no longer a Laughing Brook or a Smiling Pool.

My old friend met me at the entrance. \"You have <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> come in time,\" said she, \"for Horace Greenwood has just taken Olivia, one of the handsomest of my boarders, upstairs. She is from New Orleans and one of the most lascivious girls I ever saw; I have no doubt we shall see some fun.\" So saying she led me upstairs and ushered me into a closet which communicated with the adjoining room. Olivia and her friend were already there. I was struck with the beauty of the couple. The girl had intensely black hair and eyes, the latter of which...", "...opinion. Thus it was they were ready to take fire, and a hubbub would be the result of the slightest provocation. But, on the present occasion, there was a remarkable dearth of, all subjects of the nature described. Who was to lead Israel out to battle? Alas! no one on the present occasion. Such a one, however, appeared, at least, one who furnished a ready excuse for a disturbance. Suddenly, Mrs Chillingworth appeared in the midst of a large concourse of people. She had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> left her house, which was close at hand, her eyes red with weeping, and her children around her on this occasion. The crowd made way for her, and gathered round her to see what was going to happen. \"Friends and neighbours,\" she said \"can any of you relieve the tears of a distressed wife and mother, have any of you seen anything of my husband, Mr. Chillingworth?\" \"What the doctor?\" exclaimed one.--\"Yes; Mr. Chillingworth, the surgeon.

Mary's pure spirit could hold no communion with mine; Mary's pure spirit had left me. It is needless to say that I failed to keep the secret of my depravity from the knowledge of my mother. The sight of her grief was the first influence that sobered me. In some degree at least I restrained myself: I made the effort to return to purer ways of life. Mr. Germaine, though I had disappointed him, was too <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> a man to give me up as lost. He advised me, as a means of self-reform, to make my choice of a profession, and to absorb myself in closer studies than any that I had yet pursued. I made my peace with this good friend and second father, not only by following his advice, but by adopting the profession to which he had been himself attached before he inherited his fortune--the profession of medicine. Mr. Germaine had been a surgeon: I resolved on being a surgeon too. Having...", "...an encounter with the unknown. \"Why, not if I know it! He isn't likely to say or do anything when we hurry past him, you see,\" came Paul's low reply. \"Oh! I get on now;\" whispered Jack, as he clung to the arm of his mate; \"you expect to warn Mr. Clausin! That's a good idea. He'd know what to do, of course.\" Involuntarily Paul caressed the left sleeve of his khaki coat, where the red silk badge that indicated his right to the exalted office of assistant scoutmaster was fastened, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> above the silver one telling that he was also a second class scout patrol leader. \"Why should it,\" he said in reply; \"when our motto is always 'be prepared'?

The man looked back over his shoulder several times, as though he had caught the sound of their footsteps, and was interested. Paul noticed,...", "...first chance really to see Tramecourt. The chateau is a lovely one, a fine example of such places. It had not been knocked about at all, and it looked much as it must have done in times of peace. Practically all the old furniture was still in the rooms, and there were some fine old pictures on the walls that it gave me great delight to see. Indeed, the rare old atmosphere of the chateau was restful and delightful in a way that surprised me. I had been in the presence of real war for <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> one day. And yet I took pleasure in seeing again the comforts and some of the luxuries of peace! That gave me an idea of what this sort of place must mean to men from the trenches. It must seem like a bit of heaven to them to come back to Aubigny or Tramecourt! Think of the contrast.

The gentleman said, he did not value the lives of one hundred Indians as much as the life of one white man, or words to that extent. [This was in a debate <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> before the close of the last session. The words of Mr. CARNES were, \"I would not give the life of one white man for that of fifty Indians.\"] Mr. MURRAY said, he had two points always in his view when the frontier was a subject in that House--protection to the frontier against the hostility of the Indians, and restraint upon the whites to prevent the occasions of war against the savages.

He is wanting in love for the things he recognises, but he possesses wit, a lust for the hunting after knowledge, and the intrigues in connection with it, and he finds enjoyment in all these, even up to the highest and most distant stars of knowledge--until at last there is nothing left for him to pursue but the absolutely injurious side of knowledge, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as the drunkard who ends by drinking absinthe and aquafortis. That is why last of all he feels a longing for hell, for this is the final knowledge which seduces him.

The boy was pulling one way and the pig the other; they were of equal strength, so that for a second they were fixed in a plastic group. Struggling impotently, the boy turned his big black eyes up to the man in mute appeal, and the big black eyes suddenly recalled to Burke two other such eyes in <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> such a little brown face, and these big black eyes became a measure of the road that Burke had travelled the last three years, a road he liked not to contemplate. So he was turning from the unpleasant scene when the boy let go the tail and fell back, rigid. Burke looked down upon the stark little form with a frown of perplexity and distrust.

Feeling assured in his own conscience that he had done his whole duty as far as in him lay, all his strong and manly nature was roused to indignant anger, that his fair name should thus become the target of these arrows flying in the dark, without an opportunity being allowed him of a fair and open hearing in his own defence. He would have left the service at once,--the very end his enemies had been plotting so hard to bring about,--had not the frontier settlements, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> at that moment, been threatened with more than usual peril; and to have deserted his post at such a time would have given his accusers real grounds for the charges, which heretofore had been but a mere pretence.

These rocks lie at a great distance from the south shore, and are about three leagues to the north of Cape Upright.

And at the top of the stairs was a small room, where six little maids sat spinning.

He wondered if the same thought had come to Judge Garford. But if the aged jurist had made any comparisons, they were not reflected in his benign features. A lifetime among scenes of turbulence, and watching justice gain steady ascendancy over frontier lawlessness, had made the judge indifferent to the manifestations of the moment. \"It's <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as though we were a lot of jumping-jacks,\" thought Lowell, \"and while we're doing all sorts of crazy things, the judge is looking far back behind the scenes studying the forces that are making us go. And he must be satisfied with what he sees or our illogical actions wouldn't worry him so little.\" Fire Bear and McFann took the verdict with customary calm. The Indian was released from custody and took his place in Lowell's automobile.

It is especially necessary for me to deceive him, and he manages to find me out. The secret ardour which he refers to is my plan of making my fortune. He thinks I am unworthy of being a priest, that too, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> when I was imagining that my sacrifice of fifty louis would give him the very highest idea of my piety and devotion to my mission.\" \"In future,\" continued Julien, \"I will only reckon on those elements in my character which I have tested. Who could have told me that I should find any pleasure in shedding tears? How I should like some one to convince me that I am simply a fool!\" Three days later, Julien found the excuse with which he ought to have been prepared on the first...", "...All the men when they looked at her fell to brooding as if struck by the thought that their lives had been wasted. She was the very joy and shudder of felicity and she brought only sadness and torment to the hearts of men. \"In short, she must have been an extraordinary woman, or else Tomassov was an extraordinary young fellow to feel in that way and to talk like this about her. I told you the fellow had a lot of poetry in him and observed that all this sounded true enough. It would be <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> about the sorcery a woman very much out of the common would exercise, you know. Poets do get close to truth somehow--there is no denying that. \"There is no poetry in my composition, I know, but I have my share of common shrewdness, and I have no doubt that the lady was kind to the youngster, once he did find his way inside her salon.

However, he did get in, the innocent, and he found himself in distinguished company there, amongst men of...", "...may clear my eyes, so that I may see little Pansie's beauty, and quicken my ears, that I may hear her sweet voice, and give me nerve, while God keeps me here, that I may live longer to earn bread for dear Pansie.

Yet he seemed to be in a pleasant state of feeling, and, as was frequently the case with this simple soul, in a devout frame of mind. He read a chapter in the Bible, and said his prayers for Pansie and himself, before he went to bed, and had much better sleep than usually comes to people of his advanced age; for, at that period, sleep is diffused through their wakefulness, and a dim and tiresome half-perception through...", "...us with its humor. There is a little sequence of homely verse that never fails to bring the tears to my eyes. I have tested myself with it under the most unfavorable circumstances. In the midst of business, amid social jollity, in the mental dullness of fatigue, I have stopped and repeated to myself those three verses. So quickly acts the magic of the author's skill that the earlier verses grip the fibers of my mind and twist them in such fashion that I feel the pathos of the last lines <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as I felt them for the first time, years ago. You might all tell similar stories. I believe that this is a characteristic of good literature, and that all of it will bear reading, and re-reading, and reading again. But I hear someone say, \"Do you mean to tell me that those three little verses that bring the tears to your eyes, will bring them also to mine and my neighbor's? I might listen to them appreciatively but dry-eyed; my neighbor might not care for them enough to re-read...", "...frenzy, if he can by any means procure it.

Mr. Backus was not a novice at the game; he had been there before. For nine hundred per cent. he would let them have just enough to whet their appetites. Two bottles of whiskey to eleven Indians was about the right dose; while half a dozen would send them crazy, he knew. \"I'm <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> letting them have a few shots at the mark with my rifle,\" he continued. \"It tickles them to death to shoot with a breech-loader; they aint hardly got any themselves, and it's mighty well worth my while to keep in with them.\" He winked deliberately. \"I've been talking with them, and they know all about this mine upon the Cerro de las Viboras, just as well as those stingy Santiago folks.

The truth is, as we all know, that father Fray Andres could not swim; and even had he known how, he would have swum but ill, clad in a habit of sackcloth so voluminous as that worn by the discalced religious.

Hostilities had already commenced, the First Consul having thrown aside the mask, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> three days after we left port. The frigate treated us well, it being too soon for the abuses that followed, and we got through the pass without further molestation. As soon as in the Atlantic, I took care to avoid everything we saw, and nothing got near us, until we had actually made the Highlands of Navesink. An English sloop-of-war, however, had stood into the angles of the coast, formed by Long Island and the Jersey shore, giving us a race for the Hook.

Here's something for you.\" He read out to him Gunzo's libel which had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> arrived. The old man listened attentively, but his eyebrows contracted and his nostrils expanded during the lecture. When he had come to the description of Ekkehard's curly hair and fine shoes, the Abbot was nearly convulsed with laughter, but Moengal sat there, rigid and serious, and on his forehead a frown had gathered, like clouds before a thunderstorm. \"Well I reckon, that his pride will be well whipped out of him!\" said the Abbot. \"Sublime! really sublime!

The bishop's happiness was so great that he wanted the Carmelite, with Cadiere's help, to look after Girard's other penitents, and bring them also back to their senses. They should go to the country-house; how unwillingly, and with how ill a grace we can easily guess. In truth, it was strangely ill-judged to bring those women before the bishop's ward, a girl so young still, and but <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> delivered from her own ecstatic ravings. The state of things became ridiculous and sorely embittered. Two parties faced each other, Girard's women and those of the bishop. On the side of the latter were a German lady and her daughter, dear friends of Cadiere's. On the other side were the rebels, headed by the Guiol. With her the bishop treated, in hopes of getting her to enter into relations with the Carmelite, and bring her friends over to him. He sent her his own clerk, and...", "...of displeasure; how little did the memory of him live in their hearts, whose paternal policies had secured to them the fruits of their labour!

The travellers again occupied a wheeled carriage, and pursued their journey with rapidity. In some parts they traversed extensive forests, sublime in sylvan grandeur; then they wound through the shady defiles of intersecting hills, or passed through towns and villages, whose light and airy architecture bore evidence of Moresco origin; all around was a fair garden.

What are we to do? What are we to do?\" he said, the tears hot in his own eyes. \"I can't give you up. I can't live without you.\" She clung to him, not answering, and his mind darted back to the name he had given her that first time he had his arm about her at the promenade dance. A nymph on fire.

I aren't that sort. And you aren't either. Don't you know she's got the bride-cake bought, poor girl?\" He could not speak.

I drank a mug of cider in the quaint little beerhouse kept by Gammer Joy in Tarn Regis, and read again the doggerel her grandfather had painted on its sign-board, in which the traveller was advised of the various uses of liquor, taken in moderation, and the evil effects of its abuse. Taken wisely, I remember, it was suggested that liquor proved the best of lubricants for the wheels of life. Mrs. Joy looked <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as old and just as active and rosy as she had always looked for so long as I could remember; and she hospitably insisted upon my eating a large slab of her dough cake with my cider--a very excellent comestible it was. The old dame's mood was cheerfully pessimistic--that is to say, she was garrulous, and spoke cheerily of generally downward tendencies.

The rest of us I'm afraid, as you can see <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> by looking at me, dress very badly and old-fashioned; and there's not much point in spending much on clothes anyway, as we hardly ever leave the offices, we even sleep here. But, as I said, we decided that the information-giver would have to have nice clothes. As the management here is rather peculiar in this respect, and they would get them for us, we had a collection - some of the litigants contributed too - and bought him these lovely clothes and some others besides.

I'll be there.\" CHAPTER 22. \"Young blighted Albert,\" said Keggs the butler, shifting his weight so that it distributed itself more comfortably over the creaking chair in which he reclined, \"let this be a lesson to you, young feller me lad.\" The day was a week after Lord Marshmoreton's visit to London, the hour six o'clock. The housekeeper's room, in which the upper servants took their meals, had emptied. Of the gay company which had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> finished dinner only Keggs remained, placidly digesting. Albert, whose duty it was to wait on the upper servants, was moving to and fro, morosely collecting the plates and glasses. The boy was in no happy frame of mind. Throughout dinner the conversation at table had dealt almost exclusively with the now celebrated elopement of Reggie Byng and his bride, and few subjects could have made more painful listening to Albert. \"What's been the result and what I might call the upshot,\"...", "...with it, and you'll pull through all right.'

It has been fully proved that in every case where a machine was made to work apparently by the interposition of such a material, a fraud was perpetrated and the machine was really made to move by means of some concealed springs or weights.

A little consideration of the comparative number of students with reference to the population of the country who were thus given the opportunity for higher education--and took advantage of it--at that time and the present, will show the unreasonableness of such an opinion. It is not so easy as might be imagined to determine <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> what was the population even of England in the Thirteenth Century. During Elizabeth's reign there were, according to the census, an estimate made about the time of the great Armada, altogether some four millions of people.

Secondly, as to the supposed \"Shaksperian\" colour of the play, this is a point on which one's judgment varies each time one reads it. There is a great deal in the \"un-Fletcherian\" parts which reminds one of Shakspere; some of it is so like his later style that it is not surprising to find that many great critics have assigned it to him; many other passages, however, seem <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> not to ring true; they are obscure because they have little meaning. For let not the fact be disguised, in spite of one great lyric, several splendid scenes, and some fine speeches, there is much poor stuff in _The Two Noble Kinsmen_. The simplest explanation of the double ascription in the quarto of 1634 is to suppose that Shakspere helped Fletcher in some way. He may even have written the un-Fletcherian parts,(331) though, personally, I find traces of Fletcher in them also; he...", "...against you.

Come on.\" The girls went down and ventured into one of the dining rooms.

It was in the shape of a ring, kind of. Right away I knew what it meant. I picked up one of my oar-locks and laid it on the stain and it <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> covered it.

DEAR KREHBIEL,--I'm expecting every day to get some Griot music and some queer things, and have discovered an essay upon <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> the subject of subjects that interests Us:--the effect of physiological influences upon the history of nations, and \"the physiological character of races in their relation to historical events.\" Wouldn't it be fine if we could write a scientific essay on Polynesian music in its manifestations of the physiological peculiarities of the island-races? Nothing would give me so much pleasure as to be able some day to write a most startling and stupefying preface to some treatise of...", "...most ready?\" \"Oh, Matilda!\" said her mother, \"you're just in time; run back as quick as you can to the store, and ask Mr. Pratt to cut you a thick slice of ham. Your father will be home in ten minutes, and be angry if dinner isn't ready. There, catch up your hat, and run quick.\" \"It's always the way,\" pouted Matilda, snatching the plate her mother held toward her. \"I wanted to eat my dinner, and go nutting; but I never can do any thing.\" She did not hurry in the least; but, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> outside the gate, met her two brothers, who were quarreling about a jack-knife, one of them had found. Instead of trying to make peace, she entered into the quarrel, and soon had both of them railing at her. When her father came from his toil, hungry and impatient for his dinner, his wife was fretting; and his daughter nowhere in sight. CHAPTER III. HATTY'S PEACEFUL HOME. NOW, let us follow Hatty as she ran gayly up the narrow lane toward her humble home. The...", "...wickedness? And do you not think that to rob a person of her virtue is worse than cutting her throat?\" \"Why, now,\" said she, \"how strangely you talk! Are not the two sexes made for each other? And is it not natural for a man to love a pretty woman?\" And then the wretch fell a-laughing, and talk'd most impertinently, and show'd me that I had nothing to expect either from her virtue or compassion. _I am now come to the twenty-seventh day of my imprisonment_. One stratagem I have <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> thought of, though attended with this discouraging circumstance that I have neither friends, nor money, nor know one step of the way were I actually out of the house. But let bulls and bears and lions and tigers and, what is worse, false, treacherous, deceitful man stand in my way, I cannot be in more danger than I now think myself in.

It...", "...Water was dripping from the roof, and if there had been any story in the snow, it had thawed away. I walked along with my head down, thinking and wondering whether I would tell the Judge. Mrs. Welstoke used to say, \"Silence, my dear, is the result of thinking. You might not suppose so, perhaps, but why tell anything without a reason? People find out the good or bad news soon enough without your help. If it's good, their appetite is the sharper for it, and if it's bad, they have had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> so much longer in peace.\" I thought of these words and wondered, too, what use it would be to worry the master. If evil was to come, it would come. And then, at that moment, my eye lit on something that shone in a hollow of the snow. \"A piece of jewelry!\" I said to myself, stooping for it. My fingers never reached it in that attempt; instinct made them draw back as if the object had been of red-hot metal. But it was not of red-hot metal. It was of gold. It was a locket. It was...", "...When I discovered the matter, I began to reprove him, not with gentleness, nor in the way suited to the love-sick mind of a youth, but with violence, and after the usual method of fathers.

She left him at the hotel door and her parting hand-clasp quickened his breath. An indefinite and unreasonable exultation filled his eyes with light.

But he had faith in the big Fremont man. He took a look from the rail, to watch the dock below. Most of the passengers up here were crowded at this rail, to survey <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as he was surveying. The stern had been left comparatively free. There was his father--he recognized the tall figure, and the limp--just arrived below, gazing about anxiously. Charley yelled, and waved, but he could not make himself heard or seen. Too much else was going on. So he raced down, and rushed out upon the dock. \"Come on, quick, dad,\" he greeted, breathless. \"We've found a place!\" \"Who?\" \"The Fremont man and I.

When Nature's mantle had once more been pinned up and a drapery substituted for it, she settled down in the chair the master had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> vacated, and proceeded to discuss the grave question as to what should be done with the half-crown. She scorned my suggestion that she should spend it on a pair of gloves, and then and there decided to have it made into a brooch as a memento of the memorable afternoon.

And Abigail went down and scolded the man with the more vigor that she herself had been scolded all day on account of the headache. And so Pedro <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> grinned at her in his exasperating furrin way, and played on until he got good and ready to go.

We know that these laws are a part of the great cosmic...", "...to dad? He looked at me as if he, too, were trying to utter something difficult. 'There are passions of the head as well as of the heart,' he said finally. I opened my eyes, for he didn't often talk in such fashion. 'The old Greeks knew that. I always supposed a scholar, a teacher, had to feel that way if he was any good--that it was the mark of his calling. Perhaps you've been called; but, if so, you keep it pretty dark.' He stopped and waited for an appropriate response, but I <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> couldn't get it out. So I remarked, 'If I'm not on the boat this summer, you'll need another man when you cruise.' 'That's my affair,' said he, looking disappointed. 'Yours will be to hold down your job. I've got one ready for you. If you don't like it, you can get another. We'll see about a Ph.D. and Germany later on. But for this season, I had influence enough to get you the summer school in the Jericho district beyond Garibaldi, and you can board with Seth Miles.' When I...", "...\"You can go back to whatever you were doing, Lieutenant; I know you're not on watch right now.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" Nevan bowed to Corina, then left. Medart gave Corina his full attention. If he hadn't just watched her do it, he would have found it almost impossible to believe one small, delicate-looking student could defeat five Marines at all, much less do it so quickly and with so little apparent effort. Her demonstration didn't make the actual threat any worse, of course; it <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> made the magnitude of that threat a lot more apparent. The White Order was a small group compared to the rest of the Empire, but with that type of power, it wouldn't take many of them to cause a major disruption. Especially if they selected their targets carefully, which Medart had no doubt would be the case. He'd better find out her potential as soon as he could, he decided. If she wasn't Ranger material, best to know it right away and go from there; if she was, she should...", "...'to our Eastern question. What is Baraguay d'Hilliers?' 'A _brouillon_,' said Tocqueville. 'He is the most impracticable man in France. His vanity, his ill-temper, and his jealousy make him quarrel with everybody with whom he comes in contact. In the interest of our alliance you should get him recalled.' 'What sort of man,' I asked, 'shall I find General Randon?' 'Very intelligent,' said Tocqueville. 'He was to have had the command of the Roman army when Oudinot gave it up; but, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as he was going, it was discovered that he was a Protestant. He was not so accommodating as one of our generals during the Restoration. He also was a Protestant.

In other words, and he made the remark or something, he was probably shot in the head, if he was sitting in a convertible or to that effect.

He's out of town.\" A tall, thin man of middle age, who had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> emerged from one of the private offices, paused beside them.

And all of the remaining houses on the deserted street, desolated as though after a pestilence, were closed as well. With a contracting heart Lichonin pulled the bell-handle. A maid, barefooted, with skirt caught up, with a wet rag in her hand, with face striped from dirt, answered the bell--she had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> been washing the floor. \"I'd like to see Jennka,\" timidly requested Lichonin. \"Well, now, the young lady is busy with a guest.

All at once he raised it. A sort of splendid rectification had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> been effected in his mind. There is a widening of the sphere of thought which is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave; it makes one see clearly to be near death. The vision of the action into which he felt that he was, perhaps, on the point of entering, appeared to him no more as lamentable, but as superb.

The only opportunities for the study of aesthetics or art criticism, fifty years ago, were to be found in German universities. Kugler's handbook of painting was the chief authority in use, rather academic, but correct enough in a general way. Ruskin, a more eloquent and discriminating writer, had devoted himself chiefly to celebrating the merits of Turner and Tintoretto, but was never quite <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> to Florentine art. Mrs. Jameson followed closely after Kugler, and was the only one of these that Hawthorne appears to have consulted. Winckelmann's history of Greek sculpture, which was not a history in the proper sense of the word, had been translated by Lodge, but Hawthorne does not mention it, and it would not have been much assistance to him if he had read it. Like Winckelmann and Lessing, however, he admired the \"Laocooen,\"--an admiration now somewhat out of fashion....", "...\"He must have heard that you were here.\" \"Will he hurt me?

But, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> because he is big and strong, though not so big and strong as I am, I have taught my boy to be kind to the little animals.\" \"Then I will have no fear,\" said Uncle Wiggily, winking his nose--I mean his eyes--and just then the door of the giant's house opened and in came his little boy. Well, at first Uncle Wiggily was so frightened that he did not know what to do. I wonder what you would say if you were suddenly to see a boy almost as big as your house, or mine, walk into the...", "...these the Lugg, like the Teme, held high rank. After running out of Wales through the deep woody glens about Presteign and Aymestry, and then traversing the battlefield of Mortimers Cross, it turns due south at Leominster, and ripples brightly over a stony bed, amid lush meadows and ruddy banks, down the heart of Herefordshire towards the Wye. Ross is, of course, quite a noted little place, and has associated itself with the glories of the Wye with a particularity that is, I think, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> a trifle unfair to Hereford, which as a town is of course incomparably more interesting, and even as a vantage point on the Wye has some advantages. But Ross is the place where oarsmen, with a trip to Chepstow in view, usually hire their boats, and if not archaeologically inspiring, it is picturesquely seated on a ridge above the river, with a fine church crowning it, and a good Jacobean town hall.

That is, he can do four times as much in amount, with the same degree of fatigue, if you allow him to do it slowly. It is curious that the case is precisely the same with a steam engine. A steamer can cross the Atlantic with a very much smaller supply of coal, if she goes slowly, than if she goes fast. One might imagine that it would take <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> twice as much coal to go ten miles an hour as would be required to go five; but in reality it takes more than four times as much--the higher rate of speed requiring a very disproportionate expenditure of power.

The Twelfth Corps were sent to Leesburg, the Fifth to Aldie, and the Second to Thoroughfare Gap. The other corps formed a second line in reserve. This covered Washington and gave Hooker an excellent base of operations. In answer to his demand for reinforcements, Crawford's division of Pennsylvania Reserves, and Abercrombie's division were sent to him. As the latter was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> going out of service, it was of no use. Hooker contended that his army constituted the proper defence of Washington, and that it was not necessary to keep a large force inactive there, who could be of much more service at the front. The authorities were timid, however, did not see the force of this reasoning and therefore refused to place Schenck's and Heintzelman's commands under his orders.

For these remains were found on land actually belonging to John Bellingham, and their discovery resulted from certain operations (the clearing of the...", "...7.

I had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> heard of a child, who, after hearing me preach, was immediately taken sick, and said, 'I will go to Mr. Whitefield's God.' In a short time he died. This encouraged me to speak to little ones; but, oh, how were the old people affected, when I said, 'Little children, if your parents will not come to Christ, do you come, and go to heaven without them.'

The withdrawal of Federal troops from the South, and all the evils of the aftermath of reconstruction, led to such a terrorizing of the Negroes and such a denial of civil rights that there set in the movement that culminated in the great exodus from the South in...", "...as I shall be wanted at home.\" \"Very well, Herbert.\" Herbert left the room and hurried home, for it was nearly twelve. On the way he stopped at the post office, and found a letter addressed to his mother. He did not recognize the handwriting, nor, such was his hurry, did he notice where it was postmarked. He had no watch, but thought it must be close upon twelve o'clock. So he thrust the letter into his pocket, and continued his way homeward on a half run. He was in time, for, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as he reached the front gate from one direction, the squire reached it from the other. \"Good morning,\" said the squire, a little stiffly. \"Is your mother at home?\" \"I presume she is. Won't you come in?\" \"I wonder if they've got the money ready,\" thought the squire, as he followed Herbert into the modest sitting room. CHAPTER XVII WHAT THE LETTER CONTAINED Leaving the squire in the sitting room, Herbert went in quest of his mother. \"Squire Leech is here,\"...", "...mind, papa,\" she said at last very quietly; \"please tell me what it is.\" \"Well, dear, there are three ways out of it. You must either go to school, have some one come and live with you here, or go to live in the family of some one we know.\" \"I've always thought I should just love to go to boarding-school,\" said Ruth thoughtfully, \"but now it seems to me I should hate it. And I should simply die if you left me in this house, for I should miss you and mamma every minute.\" \"That's <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> what I feared,\" said Mr. Shirley, \"and as to the boarding-school plan, there are several reasons why I should prefer to give that up for this year. That leaves plan number three to be considered, and today I've had what I think is a brilliant idea regarding it.\" \"What is it, papa?\" asked Ruth, beginning to get interested. \"It seems to me that if I leave you with any of our friends here in Chicago you will be constantly reminded of mamma and me and will miss us more than you...", "...on the other boys.\" Here, again, the master detected a note of blame; and by the time he reached the Old Grange he was in an evil humour. He hardly knew which he found the more offensive--Chesson's dish or his discourse. He was a dainty man in his feeding, and the thought of the great fat gigot pouring out a thin red stream from the gaping wound dealt to it by the Head mingled with his resentment of the indirect scolding which he considered that he had received, and on the fire <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> kindled every drop of that corrosive sherry was oil. He drank his tea in black silence, his rage growing fiercer for want of vent, and it is doubtful whether in his inmost heart he was altogether displeased when report was made at six o'clock that Meyrick had not come in. He saw a prospect--more than a prospect--of satisfactory relief. Some philosophers have affirmed that lunatic doctors (or mental specialists) grow in time to a certain resemblance to their patients, or, in...", "...that there was no use in attempting to draw forth the information he required before the old man was ready to give it. After a pause, seeing that Morton was not again going to speak, the old man continued: \"Well, as I was saying, sir, he who is gone came to Eagleshay and me, and says he, `Are you lads ready to gain more golden guineas than you ever set eyes on in your life?' Of course we were. `It's nothing but carrying off a slip of a baby who can do little more than talk, and <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> leaving him in the plantations.' We didn't ask questions, but we went on board a little sloop he owned, and then we waited, cruising about, till one evening he told us to pull on shore, and there we found a nurse and child, and the woman gave us the child. Away we went with it aboard the sloop, and made sail, and never dropped anchor till we reached the port of Dublin. Then our captain sold the sloop, and we all went aboard a ship and sailed for America. We didn't reach it...", "...a growing discontent which covered his handsome face with a deepening shadow. He disliked being tied down to the dull life of the farm, and his horse-power threshing machine no longer paid him enough to compensate for the loss of time and care on the other phases of his industry. His voice was still glorious and he played the violin when strongly urged, though with a sense of dissatisfaction. He and mother and Aunt Deborah sang _Nellie Wildwood_ and _Lily Dale_ and _Minnie Minturn_ <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as they used to do in the coulee, and I forgot my disgrace and the pain of my blistered feet in the rapture of that exquisite hour of blended melody and memory. The world they represented was passing and though I did not fully realize this, I sensed in some degree the transitory nature of this reunion. In truth it never came again. Never again did these three brothers meet, and when they said good-bye to us next morning, I wondered why it was, we must be so widely separated from...", "...till I call. They can talk without speaking, these two. I'll question 'em separately.\" For the second time within an hour he searched Denby. From the right-hand pocket of his dinner jacket he took an automatic pistol. From the left he drew out the string of pearls. \"It's a pippin, all right,\" Taylor muttered, his eyes gloating over the treasure. \"How much did you pay the girl?\" \"Not a cent,\" his prisoner asserted. \"Nothing. You're all wrong there.\" \"Then why did she tip you off <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> now?\" \"She didn't tip me off,\" Denby told him. \"She didn't say a word, as you yourself must have heard.\" \"Can it! can it!\" Taylor retorted impatiently. \"I saw the result all right, but I couldn't get on to the cause. What did she do it for?\" Denby shrugged his shoulders and smiled a little. It was the first time he had come off his high horse. \"Maybe,\" he hinted, \"she didn't want to see me go to prison.\" \"Oh, you pulled the soft stuff, eh?\" Taylor said. \"Well, she tried...", "...with boundless hope, seeing Rome double her population, grow and spread with a wild vegetation of new districts, and once more, in his loving enraptured eyes, become the queen of the world.

It was necessary to carry him up again, and never since had he set foot on the street pavement. At that time he had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> completed his fifty-sixth year, and for fourteen years since he had remained in his arm-chair, as motionless as stone, he who had so impetuously trod every battlefield of Italy. It was a pitiful business, the collapse of a hero. And worst of all, from that room where he was for ever imprisoned, the old soldier beheld the slow crumbling of all his hopes, and fell into dismal melancholy, full of unacknowledged fear for the future. Now that the intoxication of action no longer dimmed...", "...stories. Now my thought is this: When Adam and Eve left the garden of Eden, there were two of their dumb companions whose hearts were sad for their master and mistress. They said, \"We will not let them go alone.\" And when Adam and Eve left the garden, a dog walked by his master's side, and a cat by the side of the mistress--faithful in their misfortune. XVII THE STORY OF FREIDA My mistress was not silly about me. She would say: \"I am perfectly satisfied with Daisy, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as God made him. I do not presume to improve what he has made perfect. I do all I can to bring out his good points, and leave the rest to nature.\" Then she told me the story of \"Adonis.\" His mistress had his ears pierced and gold earrings put in them. He wore them at home only. That cat did suffer for his mistress's vanity, and I could not help wishing she had been the victim; for one day a lady called, bringing with her a pet dog. She said, \"My dog has a lovely disposition,...", "...him to a tree, and flogged him to the bone; then stuck an ace o diamonds on to his back, and on it _Returned with thanks_.\" \"And that warn't all,\" grumbled the deep voice. \"That it warn't,\" came the windy chorus. \"Never is with them.\" \"But who'd done it?\" cried the boy. \"Gap Gang, sir.\" \"Who are they?\" \"Why, sir, Birling Gap Gang it should be by rights. That's where they mostly lay rough when they're this side.

The absolute assurance of a future life and of rewards and punishments consequent on our deeds in the present world would defeat the very end for which, according to the hypothesis, we are placed here; it would be fatal to the purpose of our present life considered as a state of probation. What such a state of probation requires is precisely what we have--hope; no less than this and no more. Does our heaven overcloud because we lack certainty? No: Hope the arrowy, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as constant, comes to pierce its gloom, compelled By a power and by a purpose which, if no one else beheld, I behold in life, so--hope! Such is the conclusion with Browning of the whole matter.

During the time David occupied in pouring out the pious feelings of his spirit in this manner, not a sign of surprise, nor a look of impatience, escaped them.

Excited by the scene he had <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> witnessed, and perhaps influenced by his own secret emotions, the master of song exceeded his usual efforts. His full rich voice was not found to suffer by a comparison with the soft tones of the girls; and his more modulated strains possessed, at least for the ears of those to whom they were peculiarly addressed, the additional power of intelligence. He ended the anthem, as he had commenced it, in the midst of a grave and solemn stillness. When, however, the closing cadence had...", "...smile changed in character from reflection to impatience.

She had felt it move under her hand--or under her heart, which was it?--yesterday evening. Again this morning, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> now, she had noted signs of its vitality, wholly convincing to one skilled in such matters. Impatience, then, became very excusable. \"For my time is short and the action disengages itself so deplorably slowly!\" she exclaimed. \"Pah! you greedy, conceited birds, which do you hold dearest after all, the filling of your little stomachs, or the supporting of your little dignities?

That stormy little meeting ended inconclusively. \"Will you some tea, gnadiges Fraulein?\" Pushing Jon from her, she cried out: \"No--no, thank you!

Besides, the general delicacy of the work is not in the style of Timoteo. Passavant's objection to the limbs is overruled by the presence of similar limbs in the Mond Crucifixion.

Indeed, he's quite good-looking. Since his mother died, I had lost trace of him. But I found a photograph of hers when I was clearing up my desk some months ago, and sent it to him, and he came to thank me. I forgot to tell you that I invited him for a fortnight any time he chose, and he has <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> written to ask if he may come now. I regret to say that he's on the Stock Exchange--but I was very fond of his mother. It doesn't seem to me quite a legitimate business.\" \"Why!\" exclaimed little Mrs. Joshua, unexpectedly, \"I'm given to understand that the Stock Exchange is quite aristocratic in these days.\" \"I'm afraid I am old-fashioned, my dear,\" said Mrs. Holt, rising. \"It has always seemed to me little better than a gambling place. Honora, if you still wish to go to the...", "...I don't know what to make of him. He is a sort of idol, you know, of your father's, and yet I don't think he helps him much.

'That is <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> the reason I wish it. If it were at all pleasant, it would be quite commonplace. I like to hear of adventures, dangers, and misfortunes; and above all, I love a mystery. You know, papa will never tell me, and I dare not ask him; not that he is ever unkind, but, somehow, I am afraid; and neither Mrs. Rusk nor Mary Quince will tell me anything, although I suspect they know a good deal.' 'I don't see any good in telling you, dear, nor, to say the truth, any great harm either.'...", "...and it's likely I should have died if Barzilla Giberson and Jacob Vannote hadn't found me. They took me up and carried me over to Benzeor's, though I didn't know anything about it at the time. Sarah and her mother took such good care of me that I'm all right now, or at least I'm a good deal better.\" \"You don't look as if you ought to be here,\" replied Tom. \"You say Barzilla and Jacob found you and took you over to Benzeor's? I don't understand.\" \"They're all right; I understand <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> how it is now.\" \"What, Benzeor all right?\" \"No, Barzilla and Jacob. I know all about Benzeor, too,\" he added in a low voice. \"Where is he?\" \"He hasn't been seen or heard from in four days. I don't think he'll come home again very soon. Tom, Sarah wanted me to tell you, if I saw you, that you were to come home just as soon as you could. I think she wants to explain something to you,\" he added, noting Tom's expression of surprise. \"Since she's found out about Benzeor she...", "...like mushrooms all over the United Kingdom of Great Britain, and of the 5,000,000 pounds imported from China, at least 1,500,000 pounds were sent to the American colonies. \"'Tea, in short, formed a harmless luxury indulged in by the thousands who, despite the high price and tax, contrived to have it for a delectable drink of an evening when company had to be entertained.

Come along, come along, lads. Here we are waiting for stowage, and you talk about us keeping you waiting.\" \"You mind your own job,\" growled the voice that Hilary had heard finding fault before. There was more scuffling of feet, and then the two men went on talking. \"The cutter's sailors had come, of course, after the boy, and they stumbled on the way through the rocks, <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> same as the boy did; and we waited for 'em with a few sticks, and then give 'em as much as were good for 'em, and then retreated, big Joey keeping the way till we had all got up the rock, and then up he come in the dark, and you'd have laughed fit to crack your sides to hear them down below whacking at the stones with their cutlashes till they was obliged to believe we was gone, and then they went back with their tails between their legs like a pack of dogs.\" The other man...", "...and dry, like sea-sand. And there were little shells in it. \"Fancy it having been wet sea here once, all sloppy and shiny,\" said Jane, \"with fishes and conger-eels and coral and mermaids.\" \"And masts of ships and wrecked Spanish treasure. I wish we could find a gold doubloon, or something,\" Cyril said. \"How did the sea get carried away?\" Robert asked. \"Not in a pail, silly,\" said his brother. \"Father says the earth got too hot underneath, as you do in bed sometimes, so it <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> hunched up its shoulders, and the sea had to slip off, like the blankets do us, and the shoulder was left sticking out, and turned into dry land. Let's go and look for shells; I think that little cave looks likely, and I see something sticking out there like a bit of wrecked ship's anchor, and it's beastly hot in the Australian hole.\" The others agreed, but Anthea went on digging. She always liked to finish a thing when she had once begun it. She felt it would be a disgrace to...", "...some caution. Fortunately the doorway was so deep that only two could assail me at once, and I held my ground for some time pretty fairly, only receiving a few scratches. Presently I saw another opening, and, parrying a thrust, I ran my sword through the fellow's throat. He fell with a loud outcry, which was fortunate, for it came to the ears of my friend here, and brought him and a stout retainer--a prodigiously tall fellow, with a staff longer than himself--to my aid. They were but <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> in time, for the ruffians, furious at the fall of another of their companions, were pressing me hotly, and slashing so furiously with their swords that it was as much as I could do to parry them, and had no time to thrust back in reply. My friend here ran two of them through, his tall companion levelled six to the ground with his staff, while I did what I could to aid them, and at last the four that remained still on their legs ran off. I believe they thought that the man with the...", "...laughed Marion, \"and if the moon is really made of green cheese, and we could get a slice of it, we might ripen it and have it for to-morrow's dinner.\" \"But preacher Gibson thinks it's hidden somewhere about here. He saw it, over sixty years ago. When Jeff Middleton came home from the war he came from Georgia driving a white mule hitched to a kind of sled with a box on it, and on the sled, along with some other things, was a bag of gold. Not real coins, Preacher Gibson said, but <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> like them; 'sort of queer-like coins,' that's just the way he said it. There wasn't anything to spend gold for back here in the mountains in those days. He built this house, so he must have hidden the gold here. He lived here until he was killed. The gold must still be here.\" \"Sounds all right,\" said Marion with a merry little laugh, \"but I imagine the schoolhouse windows will have to be patched with something other than that gold. And besides--\" she rose, yawning, \"we haven't...", "...like the one before described,\" containing two little jars. The same author also speaks of burnt bricks which seem to have been used sparingly.[VI-49] Waldeck, having made a similar excavation in what he calls the temple of the Palace, perhaps the building C, found a gallery containing hewn blocks of stone, and earthen cups and vases with many little earthen balls of different colors. He also speaks of a fine fragment of terra cotta which he found in the court 1 where he also discovered <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> before leaving Palenque the entrance to other galleries of the pyramid. Waldeck also gives drawings of two images of human form in terra cotta, from Dr Corroy's collection; also a face, or mask, in stucco from the cornice of the Temple of Death, whatever that building may have been.[VI-50] Galindo found stones apparently for grinding maize, similar to the Mexican _metate_; also artificially shaped pebbles, similar, as he says, to those used by the modern Lacandones but smaller....", "...\"Woman!

Will Rogers was a passenger on the same ship. When we stopped at Columbus, I managed to engage Rogers in conversation. I had always been curious about whether he talked in private life as he does on the stage and radio, and if the poor grammar in his writing was deliberate or natural. He talked to me exactly as he does on the stage and radio, and his grammar was <span class=\"clocktext\">just</span> as bad as it is in his writing. So I decided that, if it was an act, he was carrying it pretty far. I noticed that he made certain movements with difficulty. He seemed to be crippled up a little. I asked him what was the matter. He said he had fallen off his horse before he left California and had broken a couple of ribs. I thought that was kind of funny, because I had always supposed he was a good horseman. I told him that, and he said it was a new horse and he wasn't used to...", "...was well it had a door--wasn't it?\" \"You dreamed of the door because you wanted it,\" said Diamond. \"No, I didn't; it came of itself.

What Diamond meant, I do not pretend to say. He had curious notions about things. \"And now,\" said Nanny, \"I didn't know what to do, for the dog kept barking at the door, and I couldn't get out.

I was still somewhat puzzled to account for the extreme length of the night--that was altogether mysterious--and I began to think that I must have slept during the whole of a day, and was awake for two nights instead of one.
