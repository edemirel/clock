When men sailed timidly along the coasts, and dared not explore distant seas, the true position and characteristics of countries could not be ascertained with the definiteness that it is at present.

He was born 23 A.D., and was fifty-six when the eruption of Vesuvius took place, which caused his death.

From sixteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age he served in the navy, and was often surrounded with dangers and difficulties unparalleled, always proving himself an able, active, and gallant officer.

Matthew says that there were forty-two generations from Abraham to Christ. Luke insists that there were forty-two from Christ to David, while Matthew gives the number as twenty-eight. It may be said that this is an old objection. An objection-remains young until it has been answered. Is it not wonderful that Luke and Matthew do not agree on a single name of Christ's ancestors for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> generations? There is a difference of opinion among the \"witnesses\" as to what the gospel of Christ is. If we take the \"depositions\" of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, then the gospel of Christ amounts simply to this: That God will forgive the forgiving, and that he will be merciful to the merciful. According to three witnesses, Christ knew nothing of the doctrine of the atonement; never heard of the second birth; and did not base salvation, in whole nor in part, on belief.

Voltaire thought it would simplify the subject by making it originate with the Egyptians, from whom the Hebrews were to borrow it. To do this he adopted the relation of Herodotus on the subject.

For the first ten years he made nothing but spoons, thimbles, and silver combs, with an occasional napkin-ring, if any one in Providence was bold enough to order one. Businesses grew very slowly in those days. It was thought a grand success when Jabez Gorham, after nearly twenty years' exertion, had fifteen men employed in making spoons, forks,...", "...is rapidly being eliminated, so I suppose the pressure on Natural History and coals will increase.

He wrote in his day some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> plays and a few poems; since then as many hundred volumes have been written in praise of his accomplishment. He died three centuries ago, without caring enough for his own work to print it. At the present time unnumbered critics, historians, scholars, are still explaining the mind and the art displayed in that same neglected work. Most of these eulogists begin or end their volumes with the remark that Shakespeare is so great as to be above praise or criticism. As Taine...", "...I hitched his horse, and then made him undress himself, all to his shirt and drawers, and ordered him to turn his back to me. He said, 'If you are determined to kill me, let me have time to pray before I die,' I told him I had no time to hear him pray. He turned around and dropped on his knees, and I shot him through the back of the head. I ripped open his belly and took out his entrails, and sunk him in the creek. I then searched his pockets, and found four hundred dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> cents, and a number of papers that I did not take time to examine. I sunk the pocket-book and papers and his hat, in the creek. His boots were brand-new, and fitted me genteelly; and I put them on and sunk my old shoes in the creek, to atone for them. I rolled up his clothes and put them into his portmanteau, as they were brand-new cloth of the best quality.

'Oh! that it was but his brother! Oh! that it was but the Butcher!' Unfortunately, the speeches of neither Pitt nor Fox in this session have come down to us. All that we know is that Pelham declared that Pitt's was the finest speech that ever he heard. Pitt had strongly maintained that the Regency must be closely restricted, the vital contention of his son <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years later, and hinted that Cumberland, if unrestrained in his capacity as head of the Council of Regency, might be tempted to usurp the Crown. Hence the wrath of Fox, the close friend of the royal Duke; hence, too, the antipathy of Cumberland to Pitt, which was to cause complications thereafter. Pitt and his family connections, whose allegiance to the Ministry had been under suspicion, and who had been in negotiation with the Prince's party, were rallied into apparent...", "...of the young, fresh, and budding flowers; preserving, as nearly as I could, their ancient simplicity and diction.

He would ask the house, if the fathers were to be deprived of the earnings of the children, how could they provide bread for them? It was perfectly impossible.

It was promptly seized upon. It was agreed that Maine, where by no possibility slavery would or could go, should come into the Union as a free State; Missouri as a slave State, and the proviso limiting slavery in the remaining territory south of 36 deg. 30' should be adopted. This compromise was adopted in the Senate, and later, after close votes on amendments, the House also agreed to it. John Randolph and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> Southern members voted against it, and, but for weak-kneed Northern members, it would have failed. This compromise Randolph said was a \"_dirty bargain_,\" and the Northern members who supported it he denounced as \"doughfaces,\"--a coined phrase still known to our political vocabulary.

Some of the Moralities, like Bayle's _King Johan_ (1538), are crude Chronicle plays, and the early Robin Hood plays and the first tragedy, _Gorboduc_, show the same awakened popular interest in English history.

Of Shakespeare's <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> dramas, ten are true Chronicle plays of English kings; three are from the legendary annals of Britain; and three more are from the history of other nations. Other types of the early drama are less clearly defined, but we may sum them up under a few general heads: (1) The Domestic Drama began with crude home scenes introduced into the Miracles and developed in a score of different ways, from the coarse humor of _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ to the Comedy of Manners of Jonson...", "...have half the improvements that were made, and half the crop that was raised by the company I fitted out with teams, seeds, and provisions.

This increase, however, affords no criterion by which to estimate the increase in the number of plantations, for these make no returns for the first few years after being laid out.

If Vespucius had really made this marvellous voyage, he would have far outstripped all the navigators of his time, and would have fully deserved that his name should be given to the newly-discovered continent, whose coast-line he had explored for so great a distance. But nothing is less certain, and Humboldt's opinion has hitherto appeared to the best writers to offer the largest amount of...", "...many drawings; but when one remembers that the largest exhibition of his work which has ever been held contained some 450 pictures alone, not to speak of drawings, it will be seen that to be acquainted with 200 of his works is a long way from possessing a complete knowledge of what he achieved. Still the specimens I have seen I believe to have been thoroughly representative, and in any case sufficient to warrant my forming an opinion as to his merits. Van Gogh died when he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age, and Emile Bernard reminds us that though he always used to draw, he really did not give his attention wholly to painting until the year 1882--that is to say, when he was fully twenty-nine years old. About this time he writes to his brother: \"In a sense I am glad that I never learned to paint.... I really do not know how to paint. Armed with a white panel I take up a position in front of the spot that interests me, contemplate what lies before me, and say to...", "...of the ball, he was lunging upward and forward with both hands, all the muscles of his tense body behind that quick thrust, and the Claflin opponent, caught unawares, spun sideways and crashed into his guard, while Harris, the ball clutched to his stomach, smashed through and past and, stumbling, twisting, panting, pushed three yards of turf behind him before the Claflin backs pulled him down. And so it went until Brimfield, taking the enemy by surprise, had won her way to the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> yards. There someone mistook the signals, three yards were lost on second down, and, with seven to go, Harris punted high and far. Clint found his opponents too much for him that time and was hurled aside. Claflin caught on her thirty-three and ran back six. Then Clint had a chance to prove himself on the defence, and prove himself he did on the second play. The renowned Terrill, striving to draw Clint out from his guard, suddenly found himself nicely fooled, and Clint,...", "...inventions in car-coupling devices. Mr. William Douglass, of Kansas, was granted about a half dozen patents for various inventions in harvesting machines. One of his patents, that one numbered 789,010, and dated May 2, 1905, for a self-binding harvester, is conspicuous in the records of the Patent Office for the complicated and intricate character of the machine, for the extensive drawings required to illustrate it and the lengthy specifications required to explain it--there being <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> large sheets of mechanical drawings and thirty-two printed pages of descriptive matter, including the 166 claims drawn to cover the novel points presented.

This was the result of my reflections on the subject five and forty years ago, and I have never yet been able to conceive any other practicable plan. It was sketched in the Notes on Virginia, under the fourteenth query.

And from what fund are these expenses to be furnished? Why not from that of the lands which have been ceded by the very States now needing this relief? And ceded on no consideration, for the most part, but that of the general good of the whole. These cessions already constitute one fourth of the States of the Union.

In the wars of the Moghuls they were used extensively. The domestication of the African elephant has now entirely ceased; there is however no reason why this noble animal should not be made as useful as its Indian brother; it is a bigger animal, and as tractable, judging from the specimens in menageries.

This was the end that befell Otho, after he had lived <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years lacking eleven days and had reigned ninety days, and it overshadowed the impiety and wickedness of his active career. In life the basest of men he died most nobly. He had seized the empire by the most villainous trick, but took leave of it most creditably.

By this time the Russian auxiliaries, to the number of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> thousand, commanded by prince Repnin, had arrived in Moravia, where they were reviewed by their imperial majesties; then they proceeded to the confines of Franconia, where they were ordered to halt, after they had marched seven hundred miles since the beginning of the year.

The joint assault by Fox and Pitt against the Ministry on 23rd April produced a great sensation, the speech of Pitt being remarkable for its suppressed sarcasm and thinly veiled charges of inefficiency.

Addington became alarmed, and advised the King, who was now convalescent, to instruct the Lord Chancellor, Eldon, to confer with Pitt, a fact which refutes the charges of Brougham and Dean Pellew against Eldon.

SHOOTING THE CHUTE. BY WALTER CLARK NICHOLS. More swiftly than the lightest-feathered swallow wings her flight southward in the fall, more rapidly than any railroad train in the world sweeps along its iron road, you speed down a long slide at an angle of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> degrees. Your heart leaps into your throat as the boat you are in strikes the water and skims unevenly over the surface of a small pond, and then your heart comes back to its right place as you find you are unhurt. Then you give a gasp of pleasure, and are ready to try it all over again. For you have \"shot the chute.\" \"Shooting the chute\" is the invention of that intrepid swimmer and bold paddler Captain Paul Boyton. Captain Boyton, who is as brave as he is modest, is...", "...[Illustration: He meets a Bull-dog.] Neither seemed disposed to begin hostilities. Finally the dog rushed upon his adversary, who avoided him adroitly, passed underneath him, and fled in the direction of the quay, the bull-dog giving chase. Away they went, darting among the crowd of pedestrians and in and out between the carriages. In a natural spirit of imitation, the wandering dogs that encountered them running joined in the race, and at the end of a minute Moumouth had more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> dogs in pursuit of him. \"I am lost,\" he says to himself, \"but at least I shall sell my life dearly.\" [Illustration: He climbs a Wall.] He backs against a wall, and braces himself haughtily on his feet; his teeth gnashing, his hair bristling, he faces his numerous enemies with so terrible an eye that they recoil like a single man. Profiting by their hesitation, he turns suddenly and scrambles to the top of the wall. He is soon beyond the reach of the dogs, but he is...", "...of South America, the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere is twenty-eight degrees. The humidity, which modifies the conducting power of the air for heat, contributes greatly to these impressions.

When the hour of battle arrived, these two and the sailing master, and a number of raw midshipmen, were the only line-officers left, and two French officers of marines. The rest had been lost in various ways. And the crew of the 'Bon homme Richard' was as sorry a lot as ever trod a deck.

In this battle they are said to have lost above fifteen thousand men, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> colours, five standards, twelve mortars, the greater part of their baggage, and above one hundred pieces of cannon. Among the prisoners that fell into the hands of the victor, were several general officers, and a good number lost their lives on the field of battle.

The rates of postage were absurdly outrageous. For instance there was an extra charge for delivery. When a native Cuban received a prepaid letter at his own door, he was obliged to pay <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> and a half cents additional postage. The taxes on flour were so high that wheaten bread ceased to be an article of ordinary diet. The annual consumption of bread in Spain was four hundred pounds for each person, while in Cuba, it was only fifty-three pounds, nine ounces. In fact, all the necessaries of life were burdened with most iniquitous taxation. Then again there was the interest on the national debt. While the Spaniards paid three dollars and twenty-three cents...", "...He had gone about a mile toward the northeast when he came upon the fresh trail of a large band of elk that were moving toward the east. He followed, and in a short time came up with them.

The others followed him--the stronger ones in front and the weaker ones bringing up the rear. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> in the band, and by the time they had all walked in the same line they left it an open, well-beaten trail.

His own eastern provinces suffered terribly from barbarian inroads, and the end of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years' domination, which had seemed a resurrection at the beginning, showed the mighty eastern empire from day to day declining, the western bishops under the action of the Pope more and more exerting an independence which the East could not prevent, the patriarch of Constantinople more and more advancing as the agent of the imperial will in dealing with eastern bishops.

The third coalition of Europe succeeds the second. Trafalgar strews the sea with the wrecks of France, and Austerlitz strews the land with the wrecks of Russia and Austria. The sea is virtually abandoned by the man of destiny, but over the land he rises as War-lord and Emperor.

The hall is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> feet square, and no less than seventy-five feet high in the centre of the roof, which is not the original one. Some of the finest stucco wall decoration in the place is to be seen here, with elegant Arabic inscriptions, in the ancient style of ornamental writing known as Kufic, most of the instances of the latter meaning, \"O God, to Thee be endless praise, and thanks ascending.\" Over the windows are lines in cursive Arabic, ascribing victory and glory to the \"leader of...", "...were for?\" I asked. \"Why--just to--to keep,\" he said hesitatingly. \"Wait a minute,\" said I, wheeling a couple of cannon off to a distance of a yard from the passing troops. \"I'll show you something else you can do with them.\" I loaded both cannon to the muzzle with dried pease, and showed him how to shoot. \"Now,\" said I, \"_fire_!\" He snapped the spring, and the dried pease flew out like death-dealing shells in war.

It is true that most of our new naval heroes have never ventured far from our coast, and all their naval laurels have been gathered under our land batteries; but the impulse is given to the national spirit, and our conscripts in the maritime departments prefer, to a man, the navy to the army, which was not formerly the case.

The poet produced verses that his friend might set to music. The following year, 1815, he wrote a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> songs, to say nothing of six operas, and much music for church and piano. Twenty-nine of these songs were written in the month of August. One day in August eight songs were created; on another day seven.

His name was Franz Schober, and he intended entering the University in Vienna.

Perhaps the sectional tendency of the vote should be considered as indicative of the loss of the Southern States to the Administration and prophetic of the support which individualism was to receive from that section.

Of the Southern members in the House, nine voted for and thirty against sending away dangerous aliens.

It authorized the relinquishment of contracts for lands which had been entered into at high prices, and a reduction in other cases of not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> and a half per cent on the purchase-money. Many millions of dollars, six or seven, I believe, probably much more, were relinquished by this law.

S._, iii, 415), and a company of cavalry fifty; but the numbers always ran ten or twenty per cent below what the law allowed (Sen. 1; 29, 1, p. 193). One or more \"grenadier\" companies (tall...", "...INSCRIPTIONS AND HIERATIC PAPYRI Translated by Various Egyptologists The Great Tablet Of Rameses II At Abu-Simbel Translated by Edouard Naville In the great temple of Abu-Simbel, between two pillars of the first hall, there is a large tablet, which has been added, evidently, a long time after the completion of the temple. This tablet, which is the object of the present translation, is covered with a text of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> lines, containing a speech of the god Ptah Totunen to the King Rameses II, and the answer of the King. It was very likely considered by the kings of Egypt to be a remarkable piece of literature, as it has been repeated, with slight alterations, on the pylons of the temple of Medinet-Habu, built by Rameses III. The tablet, which is decaying rapidly, has been published three times: first, by Burton, in the \"_Excerpta Hieroglyphica_,\" pl. 60; then from the copies of...", "...the arms of the monarch. Vsevelod was so much affected by the sufferings which he was thus called to witness, that, dejected and disheartened, he made the best terms he could, soothing his pride by extorting from the vanquished a vague acknowledgment of subjection to the empire. He then commenced his long march of toil and suffering back again to Moscow, over vast plains and through dense forests, having really accomplished nothing of any moment. The reign of Vsevelod continued for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years. It was a scene of incessant conflict with insurgent princes disputing his power and struggling for the supremacy. Often his imperial title was merely nominal. Again a successful battle would humble his foes and bring them in subjection to the foot of his throne. But, on the whole, during his reign the fragmentary empire gained solidity, the monarchical arm gained strength, and the sovereign obtained a more marked supremacy above the rival princes who had so long...", "...This design was most useful as a \"poster\" to advertise the play.

No words of mine can fitly describe the impression, but figures sometimes aid the imagination.

At each corner of the foundation stands a tall, graceful minaret, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> feet in height. Add to this the statement that it took twenty thousand men seventeen years to complete the work, at a cost variously estimated at from $17,000,000 to $20,000,000, and you may form an idea of the delicate workmanship and artistic skill which the Taj represents. But simplicity is, after all, the keynote, and there is also a rare personality in its outlines reflecting feminine grace.

It was now far more convenient for him that his wife should remain with her relations, where she would at least have a roof over her head, than accompany him to Paris, whither he was determined to return. Madame Gauguin agreed with this arrangement, hoping to see her husband, now disembarrassed of his family, make a rapid conquest of the Parisian art-world. And so in 1885 Paul Gauguin returned to France once more to try his fortune. V He was now <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years old. Hitherto the events of his life had been largely controlled by chance; from now on he began to strive more consciously to be the master of his own destiny. It is therefore necessary, before going further with this story, to take stock of the man, both as regards his physical appearance and his intellectual equipment. Gauguin was of not more than middle height, but stockily built and of strong physical development.

But, more than this, she had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> prisoners aboard, while her own crew was sorely reduced by manning prizes. The night being calm, the British attempted to take the ship by boarding from small boats, for what reason does not readily appear, since the vessels were within range of each other, and the frigate's superior metal could probably have reduced the Americans to subjection. Instead, however, of opening fire with his broadside, the enemy sent out boarding parties in five boats. Their approach was...", "...(June-August, 1618) 331 XXVIII.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years he lived in the full glare of publicity. The social and political literature of more than a generation abounds in allusions to him. He appears and reappears continually in the correspondence of Burleigh, Robert Cecil, Christopher Hatton, Essex, Anthony Bacon, Henry Sidney, Richard Boyle, Ralph Winwood, Dudley Carleton, George Carew, Henry Howard, and King James.

This movement is sometimes counterbalanced by swinging the hand on the opposite side. [Footnote: In ordinary walking the speed is nearly four miles an hour, and can be kept up for a long period. But exercise and a special aptitude for it enable some men to walk great distances in a relatively short space of time. Trained walkers have gone seventy-five miles in twenty hours, and walked the distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> miles at the rate of five miles an hour. The mountaineers of the Alps are generally good walkers, and some of them are not less remarkable for endurance than for speed. Jacques Balmat, who was the first to reach the summit of Mont Blanc, at sixteen years of age could walk from the hamlet of the Pelerins to the mountain of La Cote in two hours,--a distance which the best- trained travelers required from five to six hours to get over.

When they were caught at last, and had to answer before justice, most of these knights of the rumal--the handkerchief with which the operation of strangling was performed--proved to be Mussulmans. The most illustrious of their leaders were not Hindus, but followers of the Prophet, the celebrated Ahmed, for instance. Out of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> Thugs caught by the police there were twenty-two Mahometans. This proves perfectly clearly that their religion, having nothing in common with the Hindu gods, had nothing to do with their cruel profession; the reason and cause was robbery.

In the valley of Guasco, the step-formed terraces of gravel are displaced in a more striking manner than at any other point. I followed the valley for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> miles (as reckoned by the inhabitants) from the coast to Ballenar; in nearly the whole of this distance, five grand terraces, running at corresponding heights on both sides of the broad valley, are more conspicuous than the three best-developed ones at Coquimbo.

The average of over sixty such ages is thirty-seven years; which means that, on the average, a man must be thirty-seven years old in order to be a candidate for a place on this list. The real question, then, is, How does the longevity of this select class of thirty-seven-year-old men compare with that of more ordinary individuals? The answer is given by the expectation of life at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years, which is twenty-nine years, making the average age at death sixty-six years. And this is precisely the age at death of these sixty great men; showing that, as a class (for these sixty may be considered a fair sample) great men are not distinguished by longevity from other men. It will thus be seen that my own conclusion is entirely opposed to that of Mr. Thayer. But this opposition rests not upon a difference of data, but upon a difference of logic. To my mind the...", "...recapture of King Henry. For the first time in her life the poor queen was completely crushed, and wished she might die rather than live for the misery that was yet in store for her. Some of the Lancastrian nobles sought her out, and expressed their intention of continuing the fight against Edward IV., and at last so aroused her from the despondent state into which she had fallen that she consented to aid them. Placing herself at the head of an army that they had raised, she marched <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> miles in one day, and met her enemy within a mile of Tewksbury.

The verdict which Voltaire passed upon his eighty years of life might, perhaps, have been applied by Montriveau to his own <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of existence; had he not thirty-seven follies with which to reproach himself? At his age he was as much a novice in love as the lad that has just been furtively reading _Faublas_. Of women he had nothing to learn; of love he knew nothing; and thus, desires, quite unknown before, sprang from this virginity of feeling.

His impression regarding this mail, both in and out of the office, agreed exactly with his evidence in 1843; viz., that all day mails, to be efficient for their purpose, should start as late as was consistent with their reaching London in time for their letters to be forwarded by the outgoing evening mails.

Having encamped on the main shore, after a run of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> miles, we set up a pole to ascertain the rise and fall of the water, which was repeated at every halting-place, and Hepburn was ordered to attend to the result.

It is true that most of our new naval heroes have never ventured far from our coast, and all their naval laurels have been gathered under our land batteries; but the impulse is given to the national spirit, and our conscripts in the maritime departments prefer, to a man, the navy to the army, which was not formerly the case.

After this long and varied career he had finally landed in that asylum for worn-out mariners, the \"Sailors' Snug Harbor.\" From here, late in 1842, he wrote to Cooper, asking him if he were the one with whom he had served in the Sterling. Cooper, who never forgot a friend, sent him a reply, beginning: \"I am your old shipmate, Ned,\" and told him when and where he could be found in New York. There in a few months they met after an interval of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years. Cooper took the battered old hulk of a seaman up to Cooperstown in June, 1843, and entertained him for several weeks.

The Telegraph.%--Think, again, what would be our condition if every telegraph line in the world were suddenly pulled down. Yet the telegraph, like the reaper and the sewing machine, was introduced slowly. Samuel F. B. Morse got his patent in 1837; and for seven years, helped by Alfred Vail, he struggled on against poverty. In 1842 he had but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> cents in the world. But perseverance conquers all things; and with thirty thousand dollars, granted by Congress, the first telegraph line in the world was built in 1844 from Baltimore to Washington. In 1845 New York and Philadelphia were connected; but as wires could not be made to work under water, the messages were received on the New Jersey side of the Hudson and carried to New York by boat. By 1856 the telegraph was in use in the most populous states. Some forty...", "...of these storms may have passed entirely along oceanic tracks, while others invaded the borders of the land, and gave rise to the floods and to the wearing away of the coast described by Pettersson. Turning now to the east of Europe, Brueckner's[34] study of the Caspian Sea shows that that region as well as western Europe was subject to great climatic vicissitudes in the first half of the fourteenth century. In 1306-1307 the Caspian Sea, after rising rapidly for several years, stood <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> feet above the present level and it probably rose still higher during the succeeding decades. At least it remained at a high level, for Hamdulla, the Persian, tells us that in 1325 a place called Aboskun was under water.[35] Still further east the inland lake of Lop Nor also rose at about this time. According to a Chinese account the Dragon Town on the shore of Lop Nor was destroyed by a flood. From Himley's translation it appears that the level of the lake rose so as to...", "...male offspring, their female offspring still inheriting the slaty tint.

The extreme importance, or rather necessity in the above case of the desired character, namely, pale-blueness, being present though in a latent state in the female, so that the male offspring should not be deteriorated, will be best appreciated as follows: the male of Soemmerring's pheasant has a tail <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> inches in length, whilst that of the female is only eight inches; the tail of the male common pheasant is about twenty inches, and that of the female twelve inches long. Now if the female Soemmerring pheasant with her SHORT tail were crossed with the male common pheasant, there can be no doubt that the male hybrid offspring would have a much LONGER tail than that of the pure offspring of the common pheasant. On the other hand, if the female common pheasant, with a tail...", "...fell into a nest of detectives, magistrates, and physicians, and I thought for a while that they were going to arrest me.

Now on that portion of the revenue with which alone he had dealt, there was a deficiency, through his changes, to the amount of five millions sterling, which loss was compensated by the increase on those very articles which Sir Robert had left untouched.

He has been at Trentham, and crossed the country back to Woburn, without coming to town.(657) Lord Gower has...", "...up his mind to leave and join the union party for Canada. He stated that the general owned a large number of slaves, which he hired out principally. Moses had no special fault to find with his master, except such as have been alluded to, but as to mistress Briscoe, he said, that she was pretty rough. Moses left four sisters in bondage. David, the next member of this freedom-loving band, was an intelligent man; his manners and movements were decidedly prepossessing. He was about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age, dark, tall, and rather of a slender stature, possessing very large hopes. He charged Dr. Josiah Harding of Rockville, Montgomery county, with having enslaved him contrary to his wish or will. As a slave, David had been required at one time to work on a farm, and at another time to drive carriage, of course, without pay. Again he had been bound as a waiter on the no pay system, and again he had been called into the kitchen to cook, all for the benefit of the...", "...between revolution and conservatism, desired that the one should conquer without violence, and the other concede without vindictiveness. These were the philosophers of the Revolution,--but it was not the hour for philosophy, it was the hour of victory; the two ideas required champions, not judges; they crushed men in their encounter. Let us enumerate the principal chiefs of the contending parties, and make them known before we bring them into action. King Louis XVI. was then only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age; his features resembled those of his race, rendered somewhat heavy by the German blood of his mother, a princess of the house of Saxony. Fine blue eyes, very wide open, and clear rather than dazzling, a round and retreating forehead, a Roman nose, the nostrils flaccid and large, and somewhat destroying the energy of the aquiline profile, a mouth smiling and gracious in expression, lips thick, but well shaped, a fine skin, fresh and high-coloured in tint,...", "...operation, throughout five continents, as well as the islands of the seas, gathered swift momentum, and is demonstrating, in both its territorial and institutional aspects, a vitality, and has registered successes, that have far exceeded the expectations of even the most sanguine among its promoters. The number of localities into which the light of this unconquerable Faith, now radiating the splendor of its glory over the face of the planet, has penetrated, has swelled to well nigh <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> hundred, marking an increase of almost five hundred in the course of a single year. The number of Sovereign States and Chief Dependencies included within its pale, which multiplied with such amazing swiftness during the opening year of this World-Crusade, has now risen to two hundred and forty-seven through the arrival of the Knights of Baha'u'llah Udai Narain Singh, Frank Wyss and Daniel Haumont, in Tibet, in Cocos Island and Loyalty Islands, respectively, as well as...", "...discharged by countrymen of his, who are justly proud that he should have been able, after a search of only a few weeks, to find a land where the hand-organ had never been heard. The Italians, as a people, have not profited much by this discovery; not so much, indeed, as the Spaniards, who got a reputation by it which even now gilds their decay. That Columbus was born in Genoa entitles the Italians to celebrate the great achievement of his life; though why they should discharge exactly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> guns I do not know. Columbus did not discover the United States: that we partly found ourselves, and partly bought, and gouged the Mexicans out of. He did not even appear to know that there was a continent here. He discovered the West Indies, which he thought were the East; and ten guns would be enough for them. It is probable that he did open the way to the discovery of the New World. If he had waited, however, somebody else would have discovered it,--perhaps some...", "...when she came back, nearly two hours later, it was distinctly an annoyance to find her bedroom still untouched. She was tired then, and wanted her lunch; but instead she replaced her street dress with a loose house gown, and went resolutely to work. Musing over her solitary luncheon, she found the whole thing a little absurd. There was still the drawing-room to be put in order, and no reason in the world why Justine should not do it. The girl was not overworked, and she was being paid <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> dollars and fifty cents every month! Justine was big and strong, she could toss the little extra work off without any effort at all. She wondered why it is almost a physical impossibility for a nice woman to ask a maid the simplest thing in the world, if she is fairly certain that that maid will be ungracious about it. \"Dear me!\" thought Mrs. Salisbury, eating her chop and salad, her hot muffin and tart without much heart to appreciate these delicacies, \"How much time...", "...but prices must rule lower in consequence of India. Beyond that let posterity wrestle with the question. As to cotton, of which America holds a firmer grasp upon the world's supply than it appears she does of wheat, India is not an impossible second if from any cause the American supply were forced to extreme prices. During the civil war in the United States, cotton cultivation in India, as I have before said, reached an extraordinary development. In 1866 the exports amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> millions of pounds sterling, $185,000,000; now the average has fallen to about $40,000,000 per year. If the staple were equal to the American, India would be formidable as a rival, but it is not, and consequently the growth of cotton in the South seems sure to increase as rapidly as ever.

Aden was reached Sunday morning, and we drove out to the native...", "...in 825. After this victory Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex submitted to Wessex; while the East Anglians, who slew Beornwulf shortly afterwards, acknowledged Ecgbert as overlord. In 829 the king conquered Mercia, and Northumbria accepted him as overlord. In 830 he led a successful expedition against the Welsh. In 836 he was defeated by the Danes, but in 838 he won a battle against them and their allies the West Welsh at Hingston Down in Cornwall. Ecgbert died in 839, after a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years, and was succeeded by his son AEthelwulf. A somewhat difficult question has arisen as to the parentage of Ecgbert. Under the year 825 the Chronicle states that in his eastern conquests Ecgbert recovered what had been the rightful property of his kin. The father of Ecgbert was called Ealhmund, and we find an Ealhmund, king in Kent, mentioned in a charter dated 784, who is identified with Ecgbert's father in a late addition to the Chronicle under the date 784.

Mrs. Lease, who is reported to have made 160 speeches in the summer and autumn of 1890, was a curiosity in American politics. Of Irish birth and New York upbringing, she went to Kansas and, before she was twenty years old, married Charles L. Lease. Twelve years later she was admitted to the bar. At the time of the campaign of 1890 she was a tall, mannish-looking, but not unattractive woman of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years, the mother of four children. She was characterized by her friends as refined, magnetic, and witty; by her enemies of the Republican party as a hard, unlovely shrew. The hostile press made the most of popular prejudice against a woman stump speaker and attempted by ridicule and invective to drive her from the stage. But Mrs. Lease continued to talk.

The peace strength of the army was 14,000 officers and 271,000 men. Mobilization added to each of the twelve corps a division of Mobile Militia bringing its strength up to 37,000 men and 134 guns.

What an innumerable multitude must have been provided for the goatsuckers alone! But there are a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> species of fly-catchers; and Noah must have had a fly-catcher family of nineteen hundred and eighteen individuals to supply with appropriate food. There are thirty-seven species of bee-eaters; and there must have been five hundred and eighteen of these birds to supply with bees. A very large apiary would be required to supply their needs.

The chief sources of support of the schools, which up to 1844 remained pauper schools, were subscriptions, lotteries, a tax on slaves and dogs, certain license fees, and a small appropriation ($1500) each year from the city council. [5] This organization opened the first schools in Philadelphia for children regardless of religious affiliation, and for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years rendered a useful service there. [6] All at once, comparatively, a new system had been introduced which not only improved but tremendously cheapened education. In 1822 it cost but $1.22 per pupil per year to give instruction in New York City, though by 1844 the per-capita cost, due largely to the decreasing size of the classes, had risen to $2.70, and by 1852 to $5.83. In Philadelphia, in 1817, the expense was $3, as against $12 in the private and church schools....", "...towards Cleopatra, the Queen, and of other things.

At Jerusalem he built a church and a hospital for pilgrims. All this was for religion, the republic, and the world. For himself he constructed four splendid villas, at Careggi, Fiesole, Caffaggiolo, and Trebbio, and in the city the magnificent palace in the Via Larga, now called the Riccardi. In <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years, from 1434 to 1471, he and his successors expended eight millions of francs (663,755 gold florins) in buildings and charities,--a sum which may be represented by as many, or, as some would reckon, twice as many, dollars at the present day. Nevertheless, the income of Cosmo was never more than 600,000 francs, (50,000 gold florins,) while his fortune was never thought to exceed three millions of francs, or six hundred thousand dollars.

But on further inquiry it was found that his title to the estate ceased with the abolition of the entail under the Entail Amendment Act of 1848.

In comparing the impressions of Gordon's disposition given by his friends, it is curious to note that among the few things in which they agree is an absence of surprise at his suicide.

Giovanni, in particular, had inherited no small portion of the Medicean craft.

Four thousand more were dispatched under Major-General Ross, of the Peninsular army, to cooperate with the navy under Admiral Cochrane on the shores of Chesapeake Bay.

Schamyl was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age when he became leader of the tribes. Of middle stature, with fair hair, gray eyes shadowed with thick brows, a Grecian nose, small mouth, and unusually fair complexion, he was one of the handsomest and most distinguished in appearance of the mountaineers.

Many libraries, of course, had been established long before the Civil War--the Library of Congress, for example, having been founded in 1800--but the great growth of the public library supported by taxation and open to all citizens alike occurred after 1865.

By 1914 there were over 2,000 libraries containing at least 5,000 volumes, and forty that contained more than 200,000 each.

The prevailing type of mind among Quaker Hill folk is the Ideo-Emotional; for these folk are a gentle, social sort of persons, ready of affection, imaginative and analogical in mental process, weak and complacent in emotionality, with motor reaction rather inconstant, and of slow response.

These are composed of persons in whom austere and domineering character proceeds from a dogmatic fixity of mind, and expresses itself in the same inconstant application shown by the former class. A few of the more notable of the personalities produced by Quaker birth and breeding belong, I think, in the Ideo-Motor class.

He was a lawyer, and a man of energy and ability; and his career was on the whole successful, from the point of view of his employers and himself; his tenure of office in New York was eight years; he was governor of New England from 1686 to 1689, when he was seized and thrown in jail by the people, on the outbreak of the Revolution in England; and he afterward governed Virginia...", "...her at the time of capture were found thirty-six chests of money intended for the pay and subsistence of the men who were to be employed in the expedition against Jamaica; and she had on board, at the commencement of the action on the 9th, 1,300 men: in the other captured ships, the whole train of artillery, the battering cannon and carriages meant for the expedition, were found. The loss of men in the British fleet in both actions was very small, amounting to only two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> killed, and seven hundred and seventy-six wounded; while the loss of the French was computed to be three thousand slain, and double that number wounded. In the Ville de Paris alone three hundred were killed. In the engagement on the 9th of April, the French fleet consisted of thirty-four sail of the line, and the British of thirty-six; but in that engagement, two of the enemy's ships having been disabled, their numerical force was reduced in the battle of the 12th to...", "...rested on his girlish visitor. \"What can I do for you?\" he asked courteously. Theodora was breathing a little quickly, and the bright color came and went in her cheeks. All unconsciously, she was looking her very best. \"I came to ask you about publishing a book.\" \"Mm. Is it one you have written?\" \"Yes.\" There was a pause, slight, yet perceptible. Then the man asked,-- \"What sort of a book is it?\" \"It's a novel. Kind of a love story.\" \"How long is it?\" \"There are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> chapters done.\" \"Then it isn't finished?\" \"No; but I could end it off about any time, if you are in a hurry for it.\" In spite of himself, the publisher smiled. Theodora's girlish naivete was refreshing to him. He liked her face and manner, and he was curious to see more of this young aspirant for fame, so he pushed forward a chair. \"Sit down,\" he said genially; \"and tell me more about it.\" With the off-hand, healthy directness of a boy, Theodora plunged into...", "...him for rent amounting to L3000. They got judgment against him, and then, when he failed to pay it, had him arrested and put in prison for the debt. So now we find the owner of the great province of Pennsylvania not only shorn of his title to his property, but actually in jail on a charge of failing to pay his rent. When the officers came to arrest him, they found him at the Quaker meeting in Gracechurch Street in London, strange to say the very place where he had first been arrested <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years before for preaching to the Quakers. For nine months Penn had to stay in prison, while the suit against him dragged slowly through the courts of chancery. The fact that he had paid so little attention to Ford's accounts, and had made no complaint about the figures in them, made it look as if the claim against him might be just. His friends tried to straighten out the tangled matter, and meantime Penn, who was allowed fairly comfortable quarters, held small...", "...both tropical and temperate kinds, of great beauty and variety in colour, form, and size of blossom.

No rhododendron grows at Churra, but several species occur a little further north: there is but one pine (_P.

Prominent among the band of heroes who accompanied Wolfe on his memorable expedition against Quebec in 1759 was a gallant hero who held the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the British army, and whose name was Guy Carleton. He was an intimate personal friend of General Wolfe, and was at that time <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age, having been born in 1722, at Strabane, in the county of Tyrone, Ireland. He had embraced a military career in his earliest youth, and had already done good service on more than one hotly-contested field.

From these dangers he managed to extricate himself by policy or warlike measures, and maintained his position till the age of seventy, during a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years.

The _Peacock_ was famous for shining brass work, spotless paint, and the immaculate trimness of a yacht, but her gunnery had been neglected, for which reason she went to the bottom in six fathoms of water with shot-holes in her hull and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> of her crew put out of action. The sting of the _Hornet_ had been prompt and fatal. Captain Lawrence had only one man killed and two wounded, and his ship was as good as ever. Crowding his prisoners on board and being short of provisions and water, he set sail for a home port and anchored in New York harbor.

The year after the war he went to Boston with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> of his warriors carrying a present of wampum for the governor. But the governor would not accept the present until Uncas had given satisfaction about the Pequots he was hiding.

ENGLISHMEN who visit America take away with them two widely different sets of opinions. In most instances they have rushed through the land, note-book in hand, recording impressions and eliciting information. The visit is too frequently a first and a last one; the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> states are run over in thirty-seven days; then out comes the book, and the great question of America, socially and politically considered, is sealed for evermore.

His little volume contained <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> poems, including _The Song of Steam_, which has been singled out by critics as his masterpiece, an ode to Henry Clay, his political idol, and his fine descriptive poem, _The Creation of Woman_.

Hannibal was the life and soul of every movement. His bold plan was to cross the Pyrenees and the Alps and descend upon Rome from the north. [Illustration: HANNIBAL] With his preparations completed, Hannibal left New Carthage early in the spring of 218 B.C., with an army numbering about one hundred thousand men, and including <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> war elephants. Crossing the Pyrenees and the Rhone, he reached the foot-hills of the Alps. Nature and man joined to oppose the passage. The season was already far advanced--it was October-- and snow was falling upon the higher portions of the trail. Day after day the army toiled painfully up the dangerous path. In places the narrow way had to be cut wider for the monstrous bodies of the elephants. Often avalanches of stone were hurled upon the trains by the hostile bands...", "...whole happiness centred on getting Joseph among them.

One thing appeared improbable--how the assumed prince should have forgotten his native language.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> cruisers, all but four of which were of wood; the fourteen single-turreted monitors built during the war; the muzzle-loading guns, belonged to a past age. By 1881 this was fully realized and the foundation of a new and splendid navy was begun by the construction of three unarmored cruisers--the _Atlanta_, _Boston_, and _Chicago_. Once started, the new navy grew rapidly, and in the course of twelve years forty-seven vessels were afloat or on the stocks.

In the dark days of the rebellion of 1798, New Ross and this vicinity of Bannow suffered horribly. Indeed the battle at the former town was the most sanguinary of that period, and an event which followed it here too horrible to be passed over without notice even at this late date. Scullaboyne House, but lately deserted by its owner, Capt. King, and seized by the rebels, was in use as a prison. In the house itself were confined some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> men and women and in the adjoining barn were over one hundred men, women, and children, chiefly, but not exclusively, Protestants. After their defeat at New Ross the rebels sent word to destroy these prisoners.

When Major Acland was sufficiently recovered to be able to travel he returned with his wife to England, where the story of Lady Harriet's bravery and devotion was already well-known. A portrait of her, in which she is depicted standing in the boat holding aloft a white handkerchief, was exhibited in the Royal Academy and engraved. Sir Joshua Reynolds also painted a portrait of her.

My dear Sir Henry,-- Nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years have gone by, more than a generation, since first we saw the shores of Southern Africa rising from the sea. Since then how much has happened: the Annexation of the Transvaal, the Zulu War, the first Boer War, the discovery of the Rand, the taking of Rhodesia, the second Boer War, and many other matters which in these quick-moving times are now reckoned as ancient history. Alas! I fear that were we to re-visit that country we should find but few faces which we knew....", "...of twenty large engravings called 'The Life of the Virgin' was published and sold by Duerer himself in book form at about the same time (1510), and was equally well received by the German people, who were at that time in a state of religious ferment consequent on the preachings of Martin Luther, and Duerer was one of his prominent disciples. {72} [Illustration: THE VIRGIN CROWNED BY TWO ANGELS.

All the subjects of 'The Larger Passion' are repeated, with variations, in this series, and twenty-five others from the Life of Christ are added. By a happy chance, thirty-five of the original woodcuts of this series are preserved in the British Museum.

Five narrow, gently sloping, fringe-like terraces rise one behind the other, and where best developed are formed of shingle: they front the bay, and sweep up both sides of the valley. At Guasco, north of Coquimbo, the phenomenon is displayed on a much grander scale, so as to strike with surprise even some of the inhabitants. The terraces are there much broader, and may be called plains, in some parts there are six of them, but generally only five; they run up the valley for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> miles from the coast. These step-formed terraces or fringes closely resemble those in the valley of S. Cruz, and, except in being on a smaller scale, those great ones along the whole coast-line of Patagonia. They have undoubtedly been formed by the denuding power of the sea, during long periods of rest in the gradual elevation of the continent. Shells of many existing species not only lie on the surface of the terraces at Coquimbo (to a height of 250 feet), but are...", "...became thence engaged in a struggle against the liberty of his country; and, in defence of their liberty, his countrymen took arms against him: so that, while with various fortune he contended with them, he fell by the treachery of his own kindred: the deliverer of Germany without doubt he was; one who assailed the Roman power, not like other kings and leaders, in its first elements, but in its highest pride and elevation; one sometimes beaten in battle, but never conquered in war: <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years he lived; twelve he commanded; and, amongst these barbarous nations, his memory is still celebrated in their songs; but his name unknown in the annals of the Greeks, who only admire their own national exploits and renown; nor even amongst the Romans does this great captain bear much distinction, while, overlooking instances of modern prowess and glory, we only delight to magnify men and feats of old.

What astonishes me is that it should feed no more; and I promise you that when it is better governed it will feed many more. The population of the States of the Church has increased by one-third in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years. But that of Greece has trebled between 1832 and 1853. Nevertheless Greece is in the enjoyment of a detestable government; as I believe I have pretty correctly demonstrated elsewhere.[2] The increase of a population proves the vitality of a race rather than the solicitude of an administration.

For, in their desire to shut out the Roman clergy and people from any share in the election, the Cardinals made haste to find a successor. As it happened, the object of their choice was also the favourite of the Roman people. Lothair of Segni was the youngest of the Cardinals, being only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age. He was sprung from a German family which had settled in the tenth century in the Campagna. He had studied in Paris and Bologna, and had been made Cardinal by his uncle, Clement III. Celestine was of the rival family of Orsini, and during his reign the young Cardinal remained in retirement and consoled himself by writing a book on the _Despite of the World_. Thus he was young, noble, wealthy, and distinguished. He showed his power of self-control at once by...", "...ancient writings, the buried tombs and temples--all those Galusha saw and took, figuratively speaking, for his own.

His speech-making proved so attractive that his father was forced to forbid him to practise it during working hours because the men would always leave their work to listen to him. During these years he had no regular employment, but did odd jobs wherever he got a chance. At one time, for example, he worked on a ferryboat for the munificent wages of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> and one half cents a day.

He attended court at Boonville, county seat of Warwick County and heard a case in which one of the aristocratic Breckenridges of Kentucky was attorney for the defense.

I should have used it much more largely but for one circumstance, namely, the almost impracticable difficulty of making it with sufficient ease and in sufficient quantities to meet the necessities of sanitary practice. We are often obstructed in this way. We know of something exceedingly useful, but we cannot utilize it. This was the case with ozone.

He had resumed that feature of his exhibition, and though he never again equaled his record of four minutes and forty seconds, he several times stayed under for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> seconds beyond the four minutes, thus evening up with the record established as a world's record--that is, so far as is known. Now and then Joe introduced something new in the way of a trick, for he still kept up his sleight-of-hand practice, not knowing when it might be useful. He could not do much of that under water, but what he did do was novel in effect. Lizzie, too, was very teachable, and she and Joe became great friends.

It authorized the relinquishment of contracts for lands which had been entered into at high prices, and a reduction in other cases of not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> and a half per cent on the purchase-money. Many millions of dollars, six or seven, I believe, probably much more, were relinquished by this law. On this bill, New England, with her forty members, gave more affirmative votes than the four Southern States, with their fifty-two or fifty-three members. These two are far the most important general measures respecting the public lands which have been adopted within the last twenty years. They took place in 1820 and 1821. That is...", "...half the written surface of one of our books, of which every page is covered with letters. A library, then, composed of 100,000 rolls, would contain no more matter than one of our libraries composed of 50,000 manuscripts. It is well known, also, that a work was divided into as many rolls as the books which it contained. Thus the Natural History of Pliny, which in the _Princeps_ edition of Venice forms but one folio volume, would, since it is divided into thirty-seven books, have formed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> rolls or volumes. If it were possible to compare elements of so different a nature, we should say that these rolls might be compared to the sheets of our newspapers, or to the numbers of our weekly serials. What would become of the great library of Paris were we to suppose its 824,000 volumes in folio, quarto, &c., to be but so many numbers of five or six sheets each? Yet this is the rule by which we ought to estimate the literary wealth of the great libraries of ancient...", "...5,000 men. Ahmed, with the object of assisting the Khalifa, had withdrawn the greater part of his force from Gedaref, and on the 7th September, Colonel Parsons started from Kassala with 1,300 men composed of the 16th Egyptian Battalion and some irregulars to dislodge the garrison remaining at Gedaref. On the 22nd Parsons arrived in front of the place, and, after defeating some 3,000 Dervishes, succeeded in occupying it. The fight was severe, the Egyptian losses being no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> killed and fifty-seven wounded. Meanwhile Ahmed Fedil, who had failed to reach Omdurman, was making his way back towards Gedaref, where, on the 28th, he turned up with 3,500 men. He made a determined assault on the town, but his Dervishes were defeated by Parsons with heavy loss. On the 1st October they withdrew to some distance, and the Egyptian force not being strong enough to pursue, occupied themselves in strengthening their defences. General Rundle was then sent up...", "...which he had commanded. We may guess, but can not assert, that his object was to establish a national organization, like that of Rome, and in doing this, he must have come into conflict with laws and customs which were considered sacred by the people. But his remaining days were too few for even the beginning of a task which included such an advance in the civilization of the race. We only know that he was waylaid and assassinated by members of his own family in the year 21. He was then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years old, and had been for thirteen years a leader of his people. The best monument to his ability and heroism may be found in the words of a Roman, the historian Tacitus; who says: \"He was undoubtedly the liberator of Germany, having dared to grapple with the Roman power, not in its beginnings, like other kings and commanders, but in the maturity of its strength. He was not always victorious in battle, but in _war_ he was never subdued. He still lives in the songs of the...", "...you will care much to hear about them.\" \"Oh, yes, we do.

Allusions are found in some of the classical writers to inscriptions written on the skins of goats and sheep; it has, indeed, been asserted by some scholars that the Books of Moses were written on such skins.

The goat skins were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> in number, dyed red, and were sewn together, so as to form a roll forty-eight feet in length by twenty-two inches in width.

To this it may be added that the fugue we are considering is essentially adapted for the pianoforte both in conception and composition.

The effect of the C minor fugue (426 K), also, rests neither on the sound effects of the pianoforte nor on those of the stringed instruments.

His fame does not rest merely upon his hymns, although he wrote 650 in all, but Neumeister will also be remembered as the originator of the Church Cantata. In this new field of musical art he was fortunate in having the cooperation of such a genius as Bach. Bach belonged to the fifth generation of a remarkable family of musicians. As many as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> of the family are known to have held important musical positions. John Sebastian, who is by far the greatest musician the Protestant Church has produced, was born in Eisenach, on March 21, 1685. The greater part of his life was spent in Leipzig, where he labored from 1723 until his death in 1750 as cantor of the Thomas school and director of music at the Thomas and Nicolai churches.

Five Commissioners in all were named, but Thomas Jefferson and Henry Laurens did not take part in the negotiations, so that the only other active member was John Jay, then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years old and already a man of prominence in his own country. Of French Huguenot stock and type, he was tall and slender, with somewhat of a scholar's stoop, and was usually dressed in black. His manners were gentle and unassuming, but his face, with its penetrating black eyes, its aquiline nose and pointed chin, revealed a proud and sensitive disposition. He had been sent to the court of Spain in 1780, and there he had learned enough to arouse his suspicious, if nothing...", "...a very friendly manner. On shore we made a bastion with our boats, and with casks and our guns, at which we all rejoiced.

As soon as it was day they crossed the bridge, which was constructed of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> boats, with every precaution in their power; for some of the Greeks, who came from Tissaphernes, stated that the enemy meant to attack them as they were crossing; but this report was also false.

The second book treats of the world, the elements, and the stars.

Varnhagen argues that there might easily have been two villages built on piles. But that is not the point. The point is, that there is no mention of the fact in its proper place, while it occurs in this imaginary voyage in a way that points unmistakably to the source whence it came. Then there is \"the best harbour in the world\", where there were friendly natives, and where the ships were refitted, the duration of the stay being given as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> days in the first, and forty-four days in the second voyage; evidently the same incident, serving for the imaginary as well as for the real voyage. This \"best harbour in the world\" was, according to Las Casas, the Gulf of Cariaco, near Cumana, where Hojeda refitted. Lastly, there is the encounter with natives, when one Spaniard was killed and twenty-two wounded. Vespucci asserts that an encounter took place during his first voyage with this number of casualties.

Up to 1749, then, when Rousseau was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years old, he had published nothing of importance. He had, however, some acquaintance with literary men, being known merely as one of those adventurers without any settled means of existence, who may always be found in cities, and with whom Paris at this time appears to have been over-furnished.

The evidence for the Petronian authorship of these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> poems is not conclusive. Arguments based on resemblance or divergence in points of style are somewhat precarious in the case of an author like Petronius, writing with great variety of style on a variety of subjects.

The bomb vessels from the rear threw their shells over the fighting ships into the town and arsenal, and in the admiral's report are credited with firing all the shipping in the harbor, except one frigate, creating a conflagration which spread over the arsenal and storehouses. Soon after the contest opened, the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> Algerine gunboats, crowded with troops, were seen advancing under cover of the smoke to board the flag-ship. The attempt, rash to insanity, met the fate it should have expected; thirty-three were sent to the bottom by the guns of the _Leander_, stationed ahead of the _Queen Charlotte_, and commanding the entrance to the port. An hour later, Lord Exmouth determined to set fire to the remaining frigate.

The troops will be disappointed,\" said General Brooke, and they were. So ended the well-planned campaign of Porto Rico, in which General Miles had arranged, by a masterly operation with 11,000 men, the occupation of an island 108 miles long by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> broad. As it was, he had already occupied about one-third of the island with a loss of only three killed and twenty-eight wounded, against a preponderating force of 17,000 Spaniards.

But the name of Jane Austen is unknown to the general public. For every reader of _Pride and Prejudice_ there are a score of readers of _Adam Bede_. George Eliot is the pseudonym of Mary Ann Evans. She took the name of _George_ because it was the first name of Mr. Lewes, and Eliot \"was a good, mouth-filling, easily pronounced word.\" George Eliot was almost <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years old before she began to write fiction; in this respect reminding us of Scott, who had first achieved fame as a poet before he began in his maturity to write fiction. We are happy in having from the pen of George Eliot herself the account of how she began to write fiction: \"September, 1856, made a new era in my life, for it was then I began to write fiction. It had always been a vague dream of mine that some time or other I might write a novel; and my shadowy...", "...which had but one door in it.

He had paid one hundred and fifty gold ducats for Zoe; but fifty of them were at least a quarter of their value under weight, so that the actual value of the gold was one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> and a half ducats.

Although to a large extent farm laborers, they were soldiers as well, and fought in many battles for Austria.

In the latter part of the seventeenth century <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> thousand Serbians went in a body to South Hungary, and fifty years later one hundred thousand, migrating to Russia, formed a colony by themselves. In 1690 the Emperor Leopold had granted a fair amount of liberty, civil as well as religious, to the large organized body of Serbs who had settled in South Hungary. Their privileges were from time to time confirmed, especially when the Emperor needed help from the Serbs against some one of his numerous enemies. At other times...", "...of the old system. The Griswolds owned the ship Panama. They started her from New York in the month of May, with a cargo of perhaps $30,000 worth of ginseng, spelter, lead, iron, etc., and $170,000 in Spanish dollars. The ship goes on the voyage, reaches Whampoa in safety (a few miles below Canton). Her supercargo, in two months, has her loaded with tea, some chinaware, a great deal of cassia, or false cinnamon, and a few other articles.

It was twice the cost of the tea, at least; so that a cargo of $200,000, when it had paid duty of seventy-five cents per pound (which would be $400,000), amounted to $600,000. The profit was at least fifty per cent, on the original cost, or $100,000, and would make the cargo worth $700,000. \"The cargo of teas would be sold almost on arrival (say eleven or twelve months after the ship...", "...by these overt acts, for the year ending the 30th day of June, 1880, one hundred and twenty-four thousand five hundred and ninety-one dollars.

But we will go further. One of these routes was turned over to Vaile by Dorsey, route 35015, and the amount paid to Vaile was two thousand eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> dollars and sixteen cents. So that the amount paid on the Dorsey routes, instead of being one hundred and twenty-four thousand five hundred and ninety-one dollars, was in truth and in fact fifty-eight thousand nine hundred and ninety-four dollars and thirty cents.

To this end a piece of land about three acres at the east end of Kingston was purchased for the sum of about 155 pounds and on it a church building fifty-seven by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> feet was begun. Because the congregation was poor and gifts were small, Liele had a struggle to complete his building. He interested in his cause several gentlemen of influence, among whom was a Mr. Stephen Cooke, a member of the Assembly, who in turn asked help of friends in England. By January 12, 1793, he was able to say that not only was the Kingston church completed but that in Spanish Town also he had purchased land for a cemetery with a house on it which served as a...", "...an arm, which had that day Shed fast atonement for its first delay, was folded on the breast in death.

The contest lasted a little more than an hour; and yet, in that brief space, six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> French, and four hundred and fifty Americans, were mangled--bleeding corpses on the ground--more than one thousand! Rapid work! It should seem that Moloch might have been satisfied with the victims offered on that day's altar. D'Estaing retired soon after with his fleet.

He was in the garden of the Blackbird-pie Castle, where the poor maid's nose had been nipped by a naughty, bad blackbird. Well, after the good Doctor had gone, the old retainer took Puss to see the King, who was so busy counting his money that he didn't even look up. \"Your Worship,\" began the retainer. \"What do you want?\" asked the King, angrily. \"I've just counted up to three trillion two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> billion, nine hundred and forty-eight million, seven hundred and fifteen thousand, four hundred and--and--now you've gone and made me miss, and I'll have to count all over again.\" \"Start off at four hundred.

At this time, the point bore west, and was distant about five miles: Our depth of water was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> fathom, and the bottom consisted of small pebbles. At day-break, having made sail, the point bore north, distant three leagues, and we now found that the land trended from it S.W. by W. as far as we could see. This point I named Cape Saunders, in honour of Sir Charles. Our latitude was 45 deg. 35' S., and longitude 189 deg. 4' W.

But at sunrise that same morning the signal had been given for the passage of the elephants, and the Carthaginians had started on their way to the Alps, the heavy-armed infantry in front, with the cavalry in the rear to protect them. Hannibal himself was determined not to stir till the elephants were safely over, but everything fell out as he expected, and the whole <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> were soon safe beside him on dry land, snorting and puffing with their trunks in the air. Then he followed his main body, and when Scipio, thirsting to give battle to the enemy he felt sure of conquering, arrived at the spot where three days before the Carthaginian army had been encamped, he found it empty.

For the clinker-built fixed-seat boats that are used at Oxford and Cambridge for the Torpids and Lent races, a racing rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> ought to be high enough, seeing that the crews are mainly composed of young oars.

The Nerbudda river formed the boundary between the two empires. In the latter years of his reign Harsha's sway over the whole basin of the Ganges from the Himalayas to the Nerbudda was undisputed.

A library, then, composed of 100,000 rolls, would contain no more matter than one of our libraries composed of 50,000 manuscripts. It is well known, also, that a work was divided into as many rolls as the books which it contained. Thus the Natural History of Pliny, which in the _Princeps_ edition of Venice forms but one folio volume, would, since it is divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> books, have formed thirty-seven rolls or volumes. If it were possible to compare elements of so different a nature, we should say that these rolls might be compared to the sheets of our newspapers, or to the numbers of our weekly serials.

There were, at that time, about twelve thousand negro men subject to the capitation tax of three dollars, already referred to, and under that law they paid thirty-six thousand dollars annually into the State Treasury of Florida; but the school law forbade that the salary of superintendents and assistant superintendents should be paid from the fund derived from the poll-tax. They provided that it should be chargeable solely to the fund raised for common schools. As there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> counties in Florida at that time, it is a fair presumption that twenty-five of them had assistant superintendents, whose aggregate salaries would amount to five thousand dollars. With the superintendent's salary, which was a thousand dollars, a draft of six thousand dollars for the salaries of white men was at once made upon the twelve thousand dollars which were to be collected from freedmen.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> he was First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and a Regent of the Kingdom.' The literary history of the Queen Anne age has many associations with his name. He proved a liberal patron of the wits, and of Pope among them, by subscribing largely to his _Homer_; but the poet's memory was stronger for imaginary injuries than for real benefits, and because Halifax had patronized Tickell, he figures in the Prologue to the Satires as 'full-blown Bufo, puffed by...", "...introduced by the early missionary priests of Kentucky, and still practised in many Catholic families.

Though Ireland dates the decay of Scandinavian power from Good Friday, 1014, yet the North did not wholly cease to send forth its warriors, nor were the shores of the Western Island less tempting to them than before.

In this new shape it has been played twenty-seven times up to January, 1913. The interesting polemic which Bjornson's production occasioned has already been discussed at some length.

The unusual preface and the twelve poems that followed he wrote in the open, while lounging on the wharves, while crossing on ferry-boats, while loitering in the fields, while sitting on the tops of omnibuses. His physical materials were the stubs of pencils, the backs of used envelopes, scraps of paper that easily came to hand. The same open-air workshops and like crude tools of writing he utilized for nearly forty years. During the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years that intervened between the first printing of his Leaves and his death in 1892, he followed as his chief purpose in life the task he had set himself at the beginning of his serious authorship--the cumulative expression of personality in the larger sense which is manifest in the successive and expanding editions of his Leaves of Grass. That book becomes therefore, a life history.

There can be little doubt that these are Le Moyne's own paintings. It is curious to find that all these scattered works in the different departments came in with the Sloane Collection which formed the nucleus of the British Museum.

It was no easy task to accomplish, for Dr. Reeves in his notes furnishes a list of no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> monasteries throughout the northern half of Ireland, of which Columba is the reputed founder and patron. Besides Durrow, Derry, and Kells, he was also the founder of Swords, Drumcliff, Screen, Kilglass, Drumcolumb, and many other celebrated houses, to which we cannot now refer in detail.[266] There is a story told, but without good authority, that during these visits to Ireland Columcille wore a cere-cloth over his eyes, and had clay from Iona in his sandals; so that in...", "...age for deportation.

Between these two rows of benches was the raised middle gallery, commonly called the waist of the ship, four feet high and about three or four feet broad. The oars were fifty feet long, of which <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> feet were outside the ship and thirteen within. Six men worked at each oar, all chained to the same bench. They had to row in unison, otherwise they would be heavily struck by the return rowers both before and behind them.

To enable his strokes to _tell_, the men sat naked while they rowed.[48] Their dress was always insufficient,...", "...and Joseph's spirit (for he was the smaller of the two) commended by the gentleman in the Wellington boots, who vowed he had been just such another at the same age.

As he could hardly have had this appointment, or have taken the political stand he did, until of age, he must have been at least twenty-one at that time. If so, he would have been not less than thirty two years old in 1620, and was probably considerably older, as his son Giles is represented by Goodwin (\"Pilgrim Republic,\" p. 184) as being \"about 15.\" If the father was but twenty-one when the son was born, he must have been at least <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> when he became a MAY-FLOWER Pilgrim.

Campbell's responsibility for the advance money then ceased. That was exactly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years ago, and I have never seen Campbell nor Mobile since. The Annie Size was a ship of one thousand tons burthen, loaded with cotton for the Liverpool market. The difficulty in getting a crew detained us several days. Two other men and I had made up our minds to make a short cut in the voyage. The plan was to steal the ship's boat, get ashore and foot it back to Mobile. As we had our advance money, there was no particular desire on our part to see Liverpool. The next...", "...with an animated throng, and at night, when peddlers and mountebanks take their stands and display their wares by the light of flaming torches, the scene is especially picturesque. On Congress street, not far from Market Square, is the First Parish (Unitarian) Church, which was rebuilt in 1825, on the site which the old church had occupied since 1740. This church is remarkable for its long pastorates, there having been but four pastors from 1727 to 1864, a period of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years. The present pastor is the Rev. Dr. Thomas Hill, ex-President of Harvard College. Lincoln Park is a public square, bounded by Congress, Franklin, Federal and Pearl streets. It contains a little less than two and one-half acres, in the middle of which is a fountain. This park is in the centre of the district swept by the conflagration of 1866, and looking on every side, not a building meets the eye which was erected previous to that year. The largest and most...", "...in a century; therefore every hundredth year has only three hundred and sixty-five days. Thus 1800, although divisible by four, was not a leap year, but a common year. But we have allowed a _whole_ day in a hundred years, whereas we ought to have allowed only _three fourths_ of a day. Hence, in four hundred years, we should allow a day too much, and therefore, we let the four hundredth remain a leap year. This rule involves an error of less than a day in four thousand two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years. The Pope, who, you will recollect, at that age assumed authority over all secular princes, issued his decree to the reigning sovereigns of Christendom, commanding the observance of the calendar as reformed by him.

I sold them very well in a London auction-room, getting almost as much as they cost me. With the money thus received in my pocket I went to a neighbouring market town where there happened to be a shop that dealt in old furniture. For less than ten pounds I bought an excellent oaken gate-table, half a dozen serviceable oak chairs, a couple of fine carved chests, and a corner cupboard. My oak dresser and settle, each good specimens of serviceable cottage furniture, cost me <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> shillings at a country auction. I found that even at these modest prices I had paid too much. Oaken furniture was common in these parts, and had little value. When a church was restored, or an old house re-constructed, large quantities of old oak were literally thrown away. Thus, at a merely nominal expense I acquired enough carved oak to fit together into a handsome fireplace, and later on the pews of a church came in for oak panelling.

Tradition affirms that in primitive times the term of protection at Durham was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> days and at Beverley thirty days on the first and second occasions, and if the fugitive resorted thither a third time, he had to become _serviens ecclesiae imperpetuum_. These intimations, if true, point to a process of evolution from small beginnings represented by the three nights' protection to which the sanctuary rights of an ordinary church were limited by the laws of Alfred (887) to the extraordinary privileges which, if we accept Mr. R.

The dangers of these word-garments, and the habit of losing all contact with reality in our constant habit of living among mere words, naturally suggest to Carlyle his favourite theme--a plea for silence. We all talk too much, and the first lesson we have to learn on our way to reality is to be oftener silent. This duty of silence, as has been wittily remarked, Carlyle preaches in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> volumes of eloquent English speech. \"SILENCE and SECRECY!

For a considerable time they were in some degree subject to the grand master of the kindred order of Calatrava. Ultimately, however, they asserted their independence by electing a grand master of their own, the first holder of the office being Don Diego Sanche. During the rule of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> successive grand masters, similarly chosen, the influence and wealth of the order gradually increased until the Knights of Alcantara were almost as powerful as the sovereign. In 1494-1495 Juan de Zuniga was prevailed upon to resign the grand-mastership to Ferdinand, who thereupon vested it in his own person as king; and this arrangement was ratified by a bull of Pope Alexander VI., and was declared permanent by Pope Adrian VI. in 1523.

This can hardly be a matter of surprise when we consider that he was thrown upon his own resources, and that his available capital consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> cents in money, in addition to a good education and a rather unusual amount of physical strength. These last two items were certainly valuable, but they cannot always be exchanged for the necessaries and comforts of life.

He died when only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age, worn out by drunkenness; and the Jews, who had learnt to hate the Egyptian dominion, gladly received the soldiers of his enemy, Antiochus the Great, into Jerusalem, deserting his young son, who was only five years old; and thus, in the year 197, Jerusalem came to belong to the Seleucid\u00e6 of Syria, instead of to the Ptolemies of Egypt.

In the middle of it is a large coffin, with the remains of a wall which had enclosed it. To the E. of this is a similar square, but of smaller dimensions.

The American force was four hundred and twenty-five officers, and six thousand two hundred and twenty men.

The American loss was twelve officers and one hundred and eight men killed; thirty-one officers and three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> men wounded. The loss of the Mexicans was still more considerable. An armistice was allowed by General Taylor, of eight weeks, subject to be revoked by either government.

The delightful breakfast that Ellen sent to the table could scarcely be eaten, so busily talking were all the members of the family. \"Come home early, won't you, Father?\" said Marjorie, as Mr. Maynard rose to go away to his business. \"And don't forget to bring me that big holly-box I told you about.\" \"As I've only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> other things to remember, I won't forget that, chickadee.

Both James the gardener and Thomas the coachman were handy men of all work, and, superintended by Mrs. Maynard, they packed the more substantial...", "...the New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal for January, 1850. The account, though all too brief, clearly establishes the date of the operation, its successful issue, and the removal of the entire bone. It is greatly to be regretted that more is not known of McCreary's personal and professional character. He is said, by one who met him often, to have been a serious, thoughtful man, given to study, devoted to his calling, and fatally fond of drink, to which he fell a victim when but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age. 1814. A younger man than either of those I have attempted to sketch, Dr. Benjamin Winslow Dudley, now came upon the stage. He, too, was the son of a pioneer. His early training was much like that of his contemporaries. Like Brashear, he had instruction in the office of Dr. Ridgely. Like him, he had attended lectures in the University of Pennsylvania. Unlike him, he carried away its diploma. This he did in 1806, just two weeks before he was twenty-one years...", "...and the shrines enriched with jewels, was inestimable. The feasts which the abbots gave were almost regal. At the installation of the abbot of St. Augustine, at Canterbury, there were consumed fifty-eight tuns of beer, eleven tuns of wine, thirty-one oxen, three hundred pigs, two hundred sheep, one thousand geese, one thousand capons, six hundred rabbits, nine thousand eggs, while the guests numbered six thousand people. Of the various orders of the Benedictines there have been <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> thousand monasteries and one hundred and fifty thousand abbots. From the monks, twenty-one thousand have been chosen as bishops and archbishops, and twenty-eight have been elevated to the papal throne. From these things, and others which may seem too trivial to mention, we infer the great wealth and power of monastic institutions, the most flourishing days of which were from the sixth century to the Crusades, beginning in the eleventh, when more than one hundred thousand...", "...constituted a quorum of the Great Sanhedrin. This was the full number of the membership of a Minor Sanhedrin. _Number of Votes Required to Convict._--\"In criminal trials a majority of one vote is sufficient for an acquittal; but for a condemnation a majority of two is necessary,\" is the language of the Mishna.[114] The full membership of the Great Sanhedrin was seventy-one. A condemnation by thirty-five acquitted the accused; a condemnation by thirty-six also acquitted. At least <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> votes were needed to convict. If a bare quorum was present, at least thirteen votes were necessary to condemn. A very peculiar rule of Hebrew law provided that \"a simultaneous and unanimous verdict of guilty rendered on the day of trial, had the effect of an acquittal.\"[115] Such a verdict was considered to be lacking in the element of mercy, and was thought to result more from conspiracy and mob violence than from mature judicial deliberation. _Jurisdiction of the...", "...controlled himself. \"Steinman, I need money for food.

It was the last that remained to him of his parents' legacy. \"How much will you give me on this?\" he said, trembling. His very life depended upon Steinman's answer. He held his breath. \"A little less than gold-value,\" said Steinman. He threw it carelessly on the scales. \"Ten dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> cents.\" Without further ado Steinman counted out the money and Libro departed.

It was the year 70, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years since that true Passover, when the Jews had slain the true Lamb, and had cried, \"His Blood be on us and our children!\" What a Passover was that, when one raging multitude pursued another into the Temple, and stained the courts with the blood of numbers!

Rossini caused in his time a great deal of trouble to managers; and if those with whom he had to deal were for the most part bald, that, he said, was to be accounted for by his having driven them repeatedly to tear their hair. Some of the directors suffered from his apparent laziness, which at most could be called dilatoriness; for that Rossini was a composer of extraordinary activity is shown by the fact that by the time he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> he had written thirty-seven operas; while, during the period of his greatest fertility, he frequently produced as many as four operas in one year. More than once, too, he completed an opera within a fortnight; but this fortnight was usually the last and never the first of the space of time assigned to him for the composition of a given work. Sometimes, however, he was annoyed and worried by managers without sufficient cause; and in these cases he knew how to retaliate. The...", "...and Linsdale (1937:233, 234) quote W.

That disproportion must of course have been greater during our colonial existence and at the Revolutionary period, when our...", "...sheets and the toilet articles which had just been brought in. \"That's all right,\" replied the latter, pleasantly and softly, by now much intrigued by Cowperwood. \"I know that there are men and men here, the same as anywhere.

His name was Walter Bonhag, and he was not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age--a big, flabby sort of person with a crafty mind, whose principal object in life was to see that this prison situation as he found it should furnish him a better income than his normal salary provided. A close study of Bonhag would have seemed to indicate that he was a stool-pigeon of Desmas, but this was really not true except in a limited way. Because Bonhag was shrewd and sycophantic, quick to see a point in his or anybody else's favor, Desmas instinctively...", "...Holden, gent., was, in all probability, the last surviving monk. On the Dissolution he appears to have returned to his native place. In 1550 we meet with his name as Sir Thomas Holden, curate of Haslingden; and in 1574 he was licensed to the same cure at the metropolitical visitation of Archbishop Grindall, held at Preston, by the style of Thomas Holden, clerk, of sober life and competent learning.

The foremost of them wore a low-crowned cap, simply decorated with a heron's plume, and a...", "...as Gallatin aptly termed him. In October, 1834, Taney's successor in the Treasury, Levi Woodbury, gave notice that the remaining debt, unredeemed after January 1, 1835, would cease to bear interest and be promptly paid on application to the commissioners of loans in the several States. On December 8, 1835, Mr. Woodbury reported \"an unprecedented spectacle presented to the world of a government virtually without any debts and without any direct taxation.\" The surplus revenues, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> and a half millions of dollars, had by an act of the previous session been distributed among the several States. But the secretary and the country soon found that they were on dangerous ground.

The hollow was undoubtedly there at the time, although it has since been filled up, and, it is believed, was likewise the grave of the fifteen hundred men and two thousand horses that were eventually collected from round about.

The undaunted marshal then waited for reinforcements. No fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> squadrons came in, Napoleon sending Kellermann's heavy dragoons as a last resort. Guyot's division of the heavy cavalry of the guard was also there--some say they had been summoned by Ney, others that they came of their own accord; the question arises because, in the next stage of the battle, their absence from the station assigned to them was a serious matter.

To reach his goal, he should have to contrive, somehow, to fill nearly every seat at nearly every performance for the balance of the year.

Not only that, but overnight his property, by virtue of this Sunday enforcement and its effect upon the trade, had seriously depreciated in value. If it had been worth <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> thousand five hundred yesterday, it wasn't worth a penny more than twenty today.

First it lacked the necessary funds and then Samuel Sloan, quite naturally, could have no enthusiasm over it. Parsons had no compunctions of that sort. The more he could dig into Sloan the better he seemed to like it. Moreover the Syracuse, Phoenix & New York involved very little actual track construction; only some seventeen miles of track from Woodward's to Fulton, which was very little for a <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> mile line. From Woodward's into Syracuse it would use the R.

His first work was published when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years of age, and was entitled \"Aurora,\" or _the morning dawn_. He was severely attacked by the religious leaders of his day, but the court at Dresden patronized and protected him. His death took place November 27th, 1624.

For these no less than eighty-six students were registered; and in the following year, fifty-two students were registered in one of the courses. In 1901-02 he gave six courses: a general course in musical culture, for which he had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> students; an advanced course in musical culture, for which he had fourteen students; a course in counterpoint, twelve students; in orchestration, twelve students; in practical composition, thirteen students; in free compositions, two students.

One, the sound of the heart of the child, which the practised ear can detect at about the fifth month, is positive and conclusive. MISCARRIAGE. Miscarriage is a fruitful source of disease, and often of danger, to wives. It also causes a frightful waste of human life. Unborn thousands annually die in this manner. _Frequency._--Miscarriage is by no means a rare occurrence. Statistics show that <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> out of one hundred mothers miscarry before they attain the age of thirty years. But this accident is much more apt to occur during the latter than during the first half of the child-bearing period; and therefore it is estimated that ninety out of one hundred of all women who continue in matrimony until the change of life, miscarry. _Influence of age of mother._--A woman who marries at forty is very much disposed to miscarry; whereas, had she married at thirty, she might...", "...of this constant drain, gave Derling a good lump sum and Mary kept the child.

The learned gentleman has revived and retailed all those arguments from his own pamphlet, which had before passed through <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> or thirty-eight editions in print; and now gives them to the House embellished by the graces of his personal delivery. The First Consul has also thought fit to revive and retail the chief arguments used by all the Opposition speakers, and all the Opposition publishers, in this country during the last seven years.

He came from the common people. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> he left England for America. He was the first to perceive the destiny of the New World. He wrote the pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" and in a few months the Continental Congress declared the colonies free and independent States--a new nation was born.

But there was not this certainty, nor even a chance of it. Still, in consequence of the great dividends promised, even as high as fifty per cent., the stock gradually rose to one thousand per cent. Such was the general mania. And such was the extent of it, that <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> millions of pounds sterling were subscribed on the company's books. And the rage for speculation extended to all other kinds of property; and all sorts of companies were formed, some of the shares of which were at a premium of two thousand per cent. There were companies formed for fisheries, companies for making salt, for making oil, for smelting metals, for improving the breed of horses, for the planting of madder, for building ships against pirates, for the importation...", "...were falling pretty thickly in the streets, showing that the Russians had penetrated unpleasantly close.

It was Pugsy Maloney who, on the fourth morning, brought to the...", "...city, happened on the 6th Jan. 1837. Considered in relation to all its accessories, the banquet was perhaps the most brilliant affair of its kind that ever took place in Glasgow.

In recognition of his exertions on Sir Robert's behalf, he was selected to respond to the toast of \"The students of the University of Glasgow who have done themselves honour by selecting Sir Robert Peel to fill the office of Lord Rector.\" There...", "...expenditure--to be precise, about thirteen millions and a half. With this view of the tabular statements Mr. B. closed the examination of the items of expenditure, and stated the results to be a reduction of the thirty-seven million aggregate in 1839, like that of the thirty-two million aggregate in 1824, to about one-third of its amount. The very first item, that of the payment of public debt in the redemption of Treasury notes, reduced it eleven millions of dollars: it sunk it from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> millions to twenty-six. The other eighteen items amounted to $12,656,977, and reduced the twenty-six millions to thirteen and a half.

In the first place the aggregate expenditures have not increased threefold...", "...impenetrable gloom spread over the room.

Wolf's madness meant prostration. But one may see how, even in the space of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years, his life was strangely parcelled out. For he did not really begin his creative work until he was twenty-seven years old; and as from 1890 to 1895 he was condemned to five years' silence, the sum total of his real life, his productive life, is only four or five years.

In 1604 he joined the College of Physicians, and three years later was elected a Fellow of that learned body. Two years afterwards he applied for the post of physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital; and his application being supported by letters of recommendation to the governor, from the king and from the president of the College of Physicians, he was duly elected to the office in the same year, as soon as a vacancy occurred.

The instrument was signed by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> chiefs and principal men, representing nearly as many different towns. The negotiations occupied ten days, being complicated by a protest on the part of North Carolina and Georgia against the action of the government commissioners in confirming to the Indians some lands which had already been appropriated as bounty lands for state troops without the consent of the Cherokee. On the other hand the Cherokee complained that 3,000 white settlers were at that moment in occupancy...", "...of every-day life.

This was circulated over the whole country, and aided not a little in adding fuel to the already furious flame of excitement. The discussion of the bill in the Senate was continued from time to time through January. It swallowed up all other interests, and was the absorbing topic throughout the country. The vote was finally reached at five o'clock in the morning of March 4, 1854, when the bill passed the Senate by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> to fourteen. Fourteen of the votes in its favor were given by Senators from the free States, and two of those against it by Senators from the slave States--Messrs. Houston, of Texas, and Bell, of Tennessee. On the 14th of March Mr. Everett presented the famous mammoth memorial, signed by 3,050 clergymen of New England, protesting against the passage of the bill.

This was the strong point of the fortifications, and within the small harbour thus formed was collected the whole Algerine fleet, consisting of four frigates, five large corvettes, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> gun-boats. But besides these harbour defences, the sea-wall of the town extended nearly a mile to the southward and a considerable distance to the northward of the harbour, being everywhere strengthened by powerful batteries.

There will remain less than eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> million livres as the amount paid by about twenty-six million Frenchmen, in general and local taxation, including tithes; an average of about thirty-two livres a head.

He could speak some English, and was far above the average of white men in native shrewdness and intelligence. He was thoroughly posted in the traditions and legends of his people. The Ojibways have for many years been cursed by contact with the worst elements of the whites, and seem to have adopted the vices rather than the virtues of civilization. I once spoke of this to \"Hole-in-the-day.\" His reply was...", "...To this river Mr. Kendall gave the name of Inman, out of respect to the Reverend and Learned Professor of the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth.

Johanna B. was afraid to talk because she fancied she was in prison. Laura A.: During her stupor was more vague, saying, \"I can't move, they won't let me be,\" without betraying any suggestion of whom \"they\" might be. Finally Mary C. (Case 7) was still more indefinite, ascribing her immobility merely to fear.

NEGATIVISM. The next of the cardinal symptoms to be considered is negativism. This term, which is often loosely used, we would define as perversity of behavior which seems to express antagonism to the environment or to the wishes of those about the patient. Naturally it is only in the minor stupors that we see it in well-developed form as active opposition and cantankerousness. For example, Harriett C., who...", "...into it, but no outlet, yet it never fills up. Evaporation, it is supposed, accounts for this. But the Caspian is salt, while the Tanganika is fresh water, and such a large body of fresh water as this was never known to exist without an outlet, and if it could be that evaporation was so great as to equal all the water that runs into it, it would not remain so fresh as it is. We will let Cameron state his own case concerning the solution of this mystery. He started with two canoes and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> men, and sailed down the eastern shore of the lake, now ravished with the surpassing beauty of the scene composed of water and sky, and smiling shores, and again awed by beetling cliffs; one evening camping on the green banks and watching the sun go down behind the purple peaks, and another drenched with rain, and startled by the vivid lightning and awful thunder crashes of a tropical storm, yet meeting with no incident of any peculiar interest to the reader.

Shortly after he came of age Thomas Stanley married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Pytts, of Kyre, in Worcestershire, and in 1634 he was honoured with the shrievalty of his native county.

This line was analogous to the Manchester & Liverpool, which proved itself from the beginning a tremendous money-earner.

Still, even in those days, Lowell had developed to a point that saw fifteen thousand tons of freight and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> thousand passengers handled between the two cities over the Middlesex Canal in 1829. Then there developed the first of a new sort of antagonism that the railroad was to face. The owners of the canals were keen-sighted enough to discover a dangerous new antagonist in the railroads.

Strong infusions of bark make leather brittle; one hundred pounds of skin, quickly tanned in a strong infusion, produce one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> pounds of leather; while a weak infusion produces only one hundred and seventeen and a half,--the additional nineteen and a half pounds serving only to deteriorate the leather, and causing it to contain much less textile animal solid. Leather thus highly charged with tanning is so spongy as to allow moisture to pass readily through its pores, to the great discomfort and injury of those who wear shoes made of it. The proper mode of tanning lasts a year, or a year and a...", "...was not courageous, nor did he love warfare, and he paid little attention to the business of the state. Judaean youths, from the royal house of David, were to be found at his court as eunuchs. How often have these guardians of the harem, these servants of their master's whims, become in turn masters of their master. The king Evil-Merodach appears to have been under the influence of a Judaean favourite, who induced him to release the captive king Jehoiachin, who had been imprisoned for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years. The Babylonian monarch clothed him in royal garments, invited him to the royal table, and supplied his wants most generously. When Evil-Merodach held his court with unusual pomp, and assembled all the great men of the kingdom about him, he raised a throne for Jehoiachin higher than the thrones of the other conquered kings. He wished all the world to know that the former king of Judaea was his particular favourite. This generosity of Evil-Merodach must have...", "...1876, whilst still infesting the regions about the Lower Euphrates, the plague appeared in South-eastern Persia, and during this and the following years it appeared at several isolated points on the borders of the Caspian Sea. Early in 1878 the disease was reported as prevailing in the district of Souj-Bulak, Persian Kurdistan, and it appeared in October of the same year at the Cossack village Vetlanka, on the Lower Volga, district of Astrakhan, Russia, after an absence from Europe of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years. It has more recently prevailed in the Assyr district, Western Arabia, and there have been rumors of its reappearances in Persian Kurdistan.

A word or two as to existing translations of Aristophanes. These, the English ones at any rate, leave much to be desired; indeed it is not too much to say that there is no version of our Author in the language which gives the general reader anything like an adequate notion of these Plays.

There remains, however, this insuperable difficulty--twenty-nine years back from 1305 brings us to 1276, some...", "...ready for occupation.

King Pedro was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years old when he ascended the throne, and his first care was to secure peace to his kingdom. To this end he sent several embassies to the King of Castile, who made a compact with Alfonso 'to be the friend of his friends, and the enemy of his enemies.' The results of this treaty may be easily guessed at.

He sought no mere personal...", "...flower-bearing lands, that have compelled me to gather into system my fading memories, and wandering thoughts.[25] And of course in the diaries written at places of which I now want chiefly the details of the Flora, I find none; and in this instance of the milkwort, whose name I was first told by the Chamouni guide, Joseph Couttet, then walking with me on the unperilous turf of the first rise of the Vosges, west of Strasburg, and rebuking me indignantly for my complaint that, being then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years old, and not yet able to draw the great plain and distant spire, it was of no use trying in the poor remainder of life to do anything serious,--then, and there, I say, for the first time examining the strange little flower, and always associating it, since, with the limestone crags of Alsace and Burgundy, I don't find a single note of its preferences or antipathies in other districts, and cannot say a word about the soil it chooses, or the height it ventures, or the...", "...she was a' most stone deaf, and I 'ad to shout the name pretty near a dozen times afore she 'eard it. \"'He don't live 'ere,' she ses. \"''As he moved?'

After this the main question was put and carried without a division; and on the next day Lord Hood and Mr. Fox were declared duly returned. Yet the house, while it condemned the scrutiny as inexpedient, still maintained its legality; for when, on the 9th of March, Mr. Francis moved a resolution for expunging that of the 8th of June preceding, by which it was authorised, he was left in a minority of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> against one hundred and forty-two. It is said that Mr. Pitt engaged in this discreditable affair from the conviction, that, within a reasonable time, a decided majority of legal votes would be substantiated in favour of Sir Cecil Wray; but it would rather appear that it was from the enmity which he bore to his rival, Fox. This, indeed, is borne out by the debates on the subject, for the speeches of Pitt teem with bitter invective against his opponent; which, perhaps, may...", "...\"Spanish grants,\" which are chiefly owned by non-residents, and which can be purchased at reasonable prices. [Illustration: SCENE IN A SOUTH FLORIDA HAMMOCK--_Page 28._] Governor Bloxham recently stated that the present financial condition of Florida is a fit subject for congratulation. There is at all times money in the Treasury to pay accrued liabilities, while the amount of the bonded debt is only one and a quarter millions, and the assessed value of the property of the State is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> millions. The condition of our public schools is decidedly progressive. There are at this time over twelve hundred schools in the State, and last year a fund of $139,000 was raised to support them. Places of worship may be found in all our settlements; not gorgeous edifices, with steeples and spires pointing heavenward, but unpretentious and comfortable structures, in which all denominations of Christians assemble to worship God according to the dictates of their own...", "...to count these.\" \"I think you are both out in your reckoning,\" said I, drawing out my note-book; \"the last baby that I shot was our thirty-seventh.\" \"What!\" cried Peterkin, \"the one with the desperately black face and the horrible squint, that nearly tore all the hair out of Jack's head before he managed to strangle him? That wasn't a baby; it was a big boy, and I have no doubt a big rascal besides.\" \"That may be so,\" I rejoined; \"but whatever he was, I have him down as number <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> in my list.\" \"Pity we didn't make up the forty,\" observed Jack. \"Ah! yes indeed,\" said Peterkin. \"But let me see: could we not manage to make it up to that yet?\" \"Impossible,\" said I. \"We are far away from the gorilla land now, I know; for, in addition to the fact that we have seen no traces of gorillas for a long time, we have, within the last few days, seen several lions, which, you are well aware, do not exist in the gorilla country.\" \"True; but you mistake...", "...which had not yet fallen due, a punctuality the more remarkable that, without taking into account the salary of his place, with the 6,000 livres pension attached to his blue ribbon, he possessed, in benefices, 678,000 livres income, and that, still quite recently, a cutting of wood on one of his abbey domains yielded him a million.\" Let us pass on to the lay budget; here also are prolific sinecures, and almost all belong to the nobles. Of this class there are in the provinces the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> great governments-general, the seven small governments-general, the sixty-six lieutenancies-general, the four hundred and seven special governments, the thirteen governorships of royal palaces, and a number of others, all of them for ostentation and empty honors. They are all in the hands of the nobles, all lucrative, not only through salaries paid by the treasury, but also through local profits. Here, again, the nobility allowed itself to evade the authority, the activity...", "...enemy would seek, at the former place, to recover those honors of war of which its gallant defenders had deprived him. * When the British under Prevost, were in possession of the neighboring islands, Moultrie writes, \"we were apprehensive the enemy would attempt to surprise Fort Moultrie; we, therefore, always kept a strong garrison there under General Marion.\"-- But, any doubt as to the destination of the British fleet was soon removed. In December, 1778, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> sail appeared before Savannah, and four thousand British regulars were disembarked. The American force left in defence of Savannah was a feeble one, of six or seven hundred men, under General Howe. General Howe was but little of a soldier. Instead of withdrawing this force, he suffered it to be sacrificed. Badly posted, he was surprised, and his troops beaten and dispersed with little difficulty. Savannah fell at once into the hands of the enemy, and the whole colony very...", "...have made them--they will stay fresh and strong in your memory in the order and sequence in which you scratched them down. And many will admire to see what a good memory you are furnished with, when perhaps your memory is not any better than mine. Sixteen years ago when my children were little creatures the governess was trying to hammer some primer histories into their heads. Part of this fun--if you like to call it that--consisted in the memorizing of the accession dates of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> personages who had ruled England from the Conqueror down. These little people found it a bitter, hard contract. It was all dates, and all looked alike, and they wouldn't stick. Day after day of the summer vacation dribbled by, and still the kings held the fort; the children couldn't conquer any six of them. With my lecture experience in mind I was aware that I could invent some way out of the trouble with pictures, but I hoped a way could be found which would let them...", "...because it mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He'll hear Jim ain't from there. Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can't. Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can LET ON, to ourselves, that we was at it <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's an alarm. Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way.\" \"Now, there's SENSE in that,\" I says. \"Letting on don't cost nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.

So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.\" \"Smouch three,\" he says; \"we want one to...", "...children dying of tuberculosis, and these bacilli have proved virulent to calves when injected into them, yet, as a matter of historical fact, the actual number of instances in which children or other human beings have been definitely proved to have contracted the disease from the milk of a tuberculous cow is still exceedingly and encouragingly small. A careful study of the entire literature of the past twenty years, some three years ago, revealed _only thirty-seven cases_; and of these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-seven</span> Koch's careful investigations have since disproved the validity of nine. On the other hand, it is anything but safe to accept Koch's practical dictum and neglect the meat and milk of cattle as a source of danger in tuberculosis. First, because the degree of our immunity against the bovine bacilli is still far from settled; and, second, because, while bacteriologists are fairly agreed that the _avian_, the _bovine_, and the _human_ represent three distinct and different..."]
