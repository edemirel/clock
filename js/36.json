The _Gustave Zede_ had also been modified by adding hydroplanes so that she became controllable submerged. The _Morse_ was one hundred and eighteen feet long by eight feet three inches beam, with a displacement of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> tons, of about the same type as the _Gustave Zede_. The _Narval_ was one hundred and eleven feet six inches in length by twelve feet four inches beam; one hundred and six tons surface displacement and one hundred and sixty-eight tons submerged. She was, like the author's 1893 design, a double hull vessel controlled by hydroplanes. She was fitted with \"Dzrewiecke\" apparatus for carrying and discharging torpedoes, two of which were carried on either side.

As the residence in the territory affects the plaintiff's wife and children as well as himself, I must inquire what was its effect.

To this and the former number I add those that were on the _penteconters[51]_ supposing eighty men on the average to be on board of each. Three thousand of these vessels were assembled; therefore the men on board them must have been two hundred and forty thousand. This, then, was the naval force from Asia, the total being five hundred and seventeen thousand six hundred and ten.

The loud ring of Colonel Creighton's voice to \"fall in,\" soon restored order, and the 7th and 5th Ohio were marched back to the rear to cover the retreat. A closing scene over Robinson's battery, at 10:30 A. M., ended the battle. The Seventh retreated in line. It entered with 325 men. Twelve were killed, and sixty-three wounded. One half of the Fifth were killed, wounded, and captured. Company C entered with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> men. Three were killed, and seven wounded, two of whom died in a few days.

It was very fine weather, and they were carried in and made into a rick by themselves, without taking any rain. In the spring they were thrashed out, and all sold for seed, at three pounds a quarter. Now, as they averaged twelve quarters an acre, the sale amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> pounds an acre; nearly three times the value of the fee-simple of the land. There was also more than three tons of straw upon each acre, and as, during that season, straw sold at six pounds per ton, the actual value of the produce (taking off one pound a ton for the carriage of the straw) was 50_l_. per acre, while the fee-simple of the land would not have sold for 20_l_. per acre.

The Nabob falls into an arrear to the Company. The Presidency presses for payment. The Nabob's answer is, \"I have no money.\" Good! But there are soucars who will supply you on the mortgage of your territories. Then steps forward some Paul Benfield, and, from his grateful compassion to the Nabob, and his filial regard to the Company, he unlocks the treasures of his virtuous industry, and, for a consideration of twenty-four or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> per cent on a mortgage of the territorial revenue, becomes security to the Company for the Nabob's arrear. All this intermediate usury thus becomes sanctified by the ultimate view to the Company's payment.

Afterwards, the number of visiters afflicted with this disease increased every year. There are many persons now living, within my knowledge (said Mr. Harvey),...", "...too long nor is life too short. Another superiority of the classical historians, as I reckon, arose from the fact that they wrote what was practically contemporaneous history. Herodotus was born 484 B.C., and the most important and accurate part of his history is the account of the Persian invasion which took place four years later. The case of Thucydides is more remarkable. Born in 471 B.C., he relates the events which happened between 435 and 411, when he was between the ages of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> and sixty. Tacitus, born in 52 A.D., covered with his Annals and History the years between 14 and 96. \"Herodotus and Thucydides belong to an age in which the historian draws from life and for life,\" writes Professor Jebb.

A reason for the new arrangement of double feasts in the Pian Breviary is the general one, that the Pope wished above all things the weekly recitation of the Psalter, and to bring about this weekly recitation and the restoration of the Sunday Office a mere rearrangement of the Psalms was quite insufficient, and a rearrangement of the gradation of feasts of concurrence and of occurrence was necessary.

And such States as may be formed out of that portion of said territory lying south of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> degrees thirty minutes north latitude, commonly known as the Missouri compromise line, shall be admitted into the Union, with or without slavery, as the people of each State asking admission may desire; and in such State or States as shall be formed out of said territory north of said Missouri compromise line, slavery or involuntary servitude (except for crime) shall be prohibited.\" To understand the third, and last clause of this...", "...be instantly located. The prestige of the chiefs should be maintained in every possible way, such as exempting them from the hut-tax, allowing them a small armed escort, etc. I realized the immense importance of this ruling through the chiefs when in the Chambesi district of Northern Rhodesia. Two chiefs of considerable influence, namely, Makasa and Changala, really administer the country under the direction of the collector. A criminal was wanted, and Changala handed him over in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours; had he not done so, all the police in the district might have hunted for a year without success. 3. _More attention must be paid to maintaining the prestige of the white man_. This is of paramount importance. There is rather a tendency amongst the officials to lower the non-official in the eyes of the native. This is fatal. The prestige must be maintained at all costs, as it is the sole hold that we have over the native. The rabble that is inseparable from a...", "...incidents. Forty-seven bodies, some of them with the clothing entirely burned away, and with few exceptions with features charred beyond recognition, had been taken there. Late in the night only four had been identified. The first body recognized was that of Mrs. Brindsley, of 909 Jackson boulevard, who had attended the matinee with Miss Edna Torney, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. P. Torney, 1292 Adams street. Mr. Torney could find no trace of the young woman. Of the forty-seven bodies <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> were of matured women and five of men. There were bodies of six children, three boys and three girls. Dr. J. H. Bates, of 3256 South Park avenue, was searching for the bodies of Myrtle Shabad and Ruth Elken, numbered among the missing. There were similar scenes at all of the undertaking rooms to which bodies were taken. \"When the fire broke out I was taking tickets at the door,\" said E. Lovett, one of the ushers. \"The crowd began to move toward the exits on the ground...", "...feet, of which there are about sixty belonging to the island. A great quantity of the fish thus caught is sent to London in smacks, employed by fishmongers or salesmen there, who annually contract with the fishermen to pay them so much per score for all the fish sent during the season. From December to April many lobsters are caught off Holy Island, nearly the whole of which are sent to London. For the herring-fishery, boats of a larger size are employed. They are from thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> feet long, about eleven feet broad, and from four and a half to five feet deep. They carry two lug sails, and have no deck. The herring-fishery commences off Holy Island about the 20th of July, and usually terminates early in September. Many herrings are caught in the Fare-way, between the Farn islands and the main-land; but the principal fishery for them is generally a little to the southward of the Staples, a cluster of small islands which lie from two to three miles to...", "...of slavery in Missouri, and the Senate voting as steadily against it. Threats of the breaking up of the Union were freely made, and the ablest public men of the day became seriously alarmed. At length a compromise was made, in which, as in all compromises, both sides yielded something. It was a law, passed on the 6th of March, 1820, providing that Missouri might come into the Union with slavery, but that in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of France which lies north of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> degrees and thirty minutes north latitude, slavery should never be permitted. This provision of law is the \"Missouri Compromise.\" In excluding slavery north of the line, the same language is employed as in the Ordinance of 1787. It directly applied to Iowa, Minnesota, and to the present bone of contention, Kansas and Nebraska. Whether there should or should not be slavery south of that line, nothing was said in the law. But Arkansas constituted the principal remaining part...", "...a team. But safe and sure the pass went from Horace Bannard and as Biffy Lea remarked after the game, \"when Arthur kicked the ball, it seemed to stay up in the air about twenty minutes.\" Some people have said that I turned a somersault and landed on my ear, and collapsed. Anyhow, it all came our way at the end, the ball sailed over the cross bar. The score then was 11 to 10, and the Princeton stand let out a roar of triumph that could be heard way down in New Jersey. There were but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> seconds left for play. Yale made a splendid supreme effort to score further. But it was futile. Crowds had left the field before Poe made his great goal kick. They had accepted a Yale victory as inevitable. Some say that bets were paid on the strength of this conviction. The Yale _News_, which went to press five minutes before the game ended, got out an edition stating that Yale had won. They had to change that story. During the seconds preceding Poe's kick for a goal I...", "...strong sympathy, fit associates to be together, it separates them by an impassable gulf from the appreciation and sympathy of the rest of mankind, who are interested only in the ordinary common-sense concerns of life. Besides these, there are several other colonies which, though not communistic, have grown out of an attempt to solve some of the questions raised by socialism. They are for the most part co-operative. The following are the principal: The Anaheim colony in California, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> miles from Los Angelos, which was formed by a large number of Germans in 1857, who banded together and purchased a large tract of land, on which they successfully cultivate the vine in large quantities. The property is held and worked all together, but the interests are separate, and will be divided in due time. Vineland, New Jersey, on the railroad between Philadelphia and Cape May, is another.

It was very early when he arrived, too early to rouse the family. He sat down in the office of a little hotel to wait for morning, and picked up a small book that lay on the writing-table. It contained pictures of the English rulers with the brief facts of their reigns. Sam Clemens entertained himself learning these data by heart.

He was then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years old. The writer in the _European Magazine_ describes this period: \"All this time he continued his astronomical observations, and nothing now seemed wanting to complete his felicity, but sufficient leisure to enjoy his telescopes, to which he was so much attached, that at the theatre he used frequently to run from the harpsichord to look at the stars, during the time between the acts.\" In an extract from his _Journal No. 1_, now at the rooms of...", "...tactics in campaigning consisted in speediness, but it seems that he studied this point badly, for his great predecessors, Alexander the Great, Frederick the Great, Hannibal, &c., also travelled quickly, but in company with an army, whilst Karr thought it quite sufficient if he went alone.

A Cossack horseman who started the same time as he did from St. Petersburg, arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours before him, informed Pugasceff of the coming of General Karr, and acquainted him as to the position of his troops. Pugasceff despatched about 2000 Cossacks to fall upon the rear of the General, and prevent his junction with the Body Guard. Karr did not consult any one at Bugulminszka. He pushed aside his colleague Freymann in order to be left alone to settle the affair. He said it was not a question of fighting but of chasing.

Orsino and a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> of his men lie dead on the pavement, the fire licks the rafters, the crowd press outward, and the great roof falls crashing down into wide pools of blood.

Rodney consequently went to Santa Lucia, to refit Hood's ships, and to prepare for the coming campaign, in which it was understood that the conquest of Jamaica was to be the first object of the allies. An important condition to their success was the arrival of a great convoy, known to be on its way from Brest to repair the losses which Kempenfelt's raid and subsequent bad weather had inflicted in December. Hood suggested to Rodney to halve the fleet, which then numbered <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> of the line, letting one part cruise north of Dominica, between that island and Deseada, while the other guarded the southern approach, between Martinique and Santa Lucia. Rodney, however, was unwilling to do this, and adopted a half-measure,--Hood's division being stationed to windward of the north end of Martinique, reaching only as far north as the latitude of Dominica, while the center and rear were abreast of the centre and south of Martinique; all in mutual touch by...", "...we see, was not very promising for Charles VIII; so he resolved to rely on his ally Ludovico Sforza alone, and to relegate all other questions to the fortunes of war. A piece of news that reached him about this time strengthened him in this resolution: this was the death of Ferdinand. The old king had caught a severe cold and cough on his return from the hunting field, and in two days he was at his last gasp. On the 25th of January, 1494, he passed away, at the age of seventy, after a <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years' reign, leaving the throne to his elder son, Alfonso, who was immediately chosen as his successor. Ferdinand never belied his title of \"the happy ruler.\" His death occurred at the very moment when the fortune of his family was changing.

The only hope of the opposition was now in delay; and factious divisions were made on every point possible as the bill went through the committee. The opposition was most vexatious.

The Republican National Convention was held in Chicago at the opening of June. As General Grant had returned from his memorable tour round the world, having been received everywhere with the highest honors, a determined effort was now made to renominate him for a third term. Roscoe Conkling, United States senator from New York, was the leader in the movement, and the whole number of Grant's supporters was 306, who without a break cast their vote for him <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> times in succession. They failed because of the widespread opposition to any man holding the exalted office for a longer period than Washington, the Father of his Country. The principal rivals of General Grant were James G. Blaine, of Maine, and John Sherman, of Ohio. There being a deadlock, the supporters of these two candidates united and thereby nominated James A. Garfield, of Ohio, with Chester A. Arthur, of New York, as the nominee for Vice-President....", "...reaction SiO_{2} + 3C = CSi + 2CO.

Francisco himself lay in chains for two months, and, of course, had a grudge against Captain Green. It was proved that the 'Worcester' had a cipher wherein to communicate with her owners, who used great secrecy; that her cargo consisted of arms, and was of such slight value as not to justify her voyage, unless her real business was piracy. The ship was of 200 tons, twenty guns, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> men, and the value of the cargo was but 1,000_l._ Really, things do not look very well for the enterprise of Captain Green! There was also found a suspicious letter to one of the crew, Reynolds, from his sister-in-law, advising him to confess, and referring to a letter of his own in which he said that some of the crew 'had basely confessed.'

The chance of the same cast three times successively is, by a similar reasoning, 1/6^3 or 1/216: that is, the event will happen, on a large average, only once in two hundred and sixteen throws.

HUMOR, WIT, FUN, AND SATIRE PREFATORY NOTE In the winter of 1855, when Lowell was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years old, he gave a course of twelve lectures before the Lowell Institute in Boston. His subject was the English Poets, and the special topics of the successive lectures were: 1, \"Poetry, and the Poetic Sentiment,\" illustrating the imaginative faculty; 2, \"Piers Ploughman's Vision,\" as the first characteristically English poem; 3, \"The Metrical Romances,\" marking the advent into our poetry of the sense of Beauty; 4, \"The Ballads,\" especially as models of narrative diction;...", "...up to him by the Government, caused him to be brought to his estate of Sakura as a criminal, in a litter covered with nets, and confined him in prison.

Accordingly Sogoro, his wife and children, and the elders of the hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> villages were brought before the Court-house of Sakura, in which were assembled forty-five chief officers. The elders were then told that, yielding to their petition, their lord was graciously pleased to order that the oppressive taxes should be remitted, and that the dues levied should not exceed those of the olden time. As for Sogoro and his wife, the following sentence was passed upon them:-- \"Whereas you have set yourself up as the head of the villagers; whereas,...", "...Ibid.] In December, 1830, a midwife, who had attended two fatal cases of puerperal fever at the British Lying-in Hospital, examined a patient who had just been admitted, to ascertain if labor had commenced. This patient remained two days in the expectation that labor would come on, when she returned home and was then suddenly taken in labor and delivered before she could set out for the hospital. She went on favorably for two days, and was then taken with puerperal fever and died in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours. [Footnote: Ibid.] A young practitioner, contrary to advice, examined the body of a patient who had died from puerperal fever; there was no epidemic at the time; the case appeared to be purely sporadic.

The patients of his colleague did well, except one, where he assisted to remove some coagula from the uterus; she was...", "...clear, it had made no progress till April. In that month two men had died of this most foul disease; and in the first week of May its victims numbered nine; and yet another fortnight and it had hurried seventeen citizens to the grave. Now the memory of their wickedness rising before them, dread took up its abode in all men's hearts; for none knew but his day of reckoning was at hand. And their consternation was greater when it was remembered that in the third year of this century <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> thousand citizens of London had died of the plague, while twenty-five years later it had swept away thirty-five thousand; and eleven years after full ten thousand persons perished of this same pestilence. Moreover, but two years previous, a like scourge had been rife in Holland; and in Amsterdam alone twenty-four thousand citizens had died from its effects.

When I left you as lieutenant of Captain Levee's schooner, we very shortly afterwards had an action with a Spanish vessel of very superior force, for she mounted thirty guns. Having no chance with her, from her superior weight of metal, we threw ourselves on her bow and boarded. The Spaniards did not relish this kind of close fighting, and gave us immediate possession of their deck. Captain Levee, when he brought in his prize, was appointed to a frigate of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> guns, and I followed him as his first-lieutenant. We had another combat with a vessel of equal force, in which we were the victors, and I was sent in the prize. Captain Levee wrote very kindly in my behalf and I was made a captain, and given the command of a small brig. But let me first finish with Captain Levee. He captured a galleon, which gave him a large fortune, and he then gave up the command of his ship, and went on shore, telling me in a letter that he had...", "...of the Dominion of Canada, Chap. lxvi., p. 327. \"The Loyalists who settled at the St. John River did not agree very well with the original settlers. They grew angry with the Governor because their grants of land had not been surveyed.

Nova Scotia was then divided into eight counties, and there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> representatives in the Assembly, the districts where a number of Loyalists had settled being included in the county of Halifax. Governor Parr opposed an increase of representation, as his instructions forbade his increasing or diminishing the number of representatives in the Assembly. \"The Loyalists then began to agitate for a division of the province--a policy which was strongly opposed by the Governor, and which gave rise to much excitement and ill-feeling. Parr went so...", "...five louis here, three louis there. He gave notes, took up ruinous obligations, dealt with usurers and all the race of lenders.

When Madame Loisel took back the necklace Madame Forestier said to her with a chilly manner: \"You should have returned it sooner; I might have needed it.\" She did not open the case, as her friend had so much feared.

Some officers who had made an excursion to that settlement, with a view of selecting eligible spots for farms, on their return spoke highly of the corn which they saw growing there, and of the picturesque appearance of many of the settlers' farms. The settlers told them, that in general their grounds which had been in wheat had produced from thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> bushels an acre; that they found one bushel (or on some spots five pecks) of seed sufficient to sow an acre; and that, if sown as early as the month of April or May, they imagined the ground would produce a second crop, and the season be not too far advanced to ripen it.

If there was ever a man who loved his country and was proud of it; whose broad, deep, and strong patriotism did not need the saliency of ignorant partisanship, it was Washington Irving. He was, like his namesake, an American, and with the same pure loyalty and unpartisan candor. The first number of the \"Sketch-Book\" was published in America in May, 1819. Irving was then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years old. The series was not completed till September, 1820. The first installment was carried mainly by two papers, \"The Wife\" and \"Rip Van Winkle:\" the one full of tender pathos that touched all hearts, because it was recognized as a genuine expression of the author's nature; and the other a happy effort of imaginative humor, one of those strokes of genius that re-create the world and clothe it with the unfading hues of romance; the theme was an old-world echo,...", "...many disadvantages as can well be imagined.

The first settler was...", "...as he could across the forest. Alila could not believe what had happened to me; he felt all over my body, in order to convince himself that the ball had not passed through me. When he was quite sure that I had not received a wound, he said to me: \"Master, if you had not had the anten-anten about you you would have been killed.\" My Indians always believed I was possessed of this secret, as well as of many others. For instance, when they often saw me go for twenty-four, even for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours, without eating or drinking, they became persuaded that I could live in that manner for an indefinite period; and one day, a good Tagalese padre, in whose house I chanced to be, almost went upon his knees while begging me to communicate to him the power I possessed, as he said, to live without food. The Tagals have retained all their old superstitions.

She did not want Virginia to marry and free herself from chaperonage; and if she...", "...these objects, the tails of the two smaller not reaching each other, or the large comet. To all appearance they were absolutely independent comets.\" Nevertheless, Spitaler, at Vienna, in the early days of August, perceived, as it were, a thin cocoon of nebulosity woven round the entire trio.[1345] One of them faded from view September 5; the other actually outshone the original comet on August 31, but was plainly of inferior vitality. It was last seen by Barnard on November 25, with the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> inch refractor, while its primary afforded an observation for position with the twelve-inch, March 20, 1890.[1346] A cause for the disruption it had presumably undergone had, before then, been plausibly assigned. The adventures of Lexell's comet have long served to exemplify the effects of Jupiter's despotic sway over such bodies.

For five months of the spring and summer of 1838 they rode together from town to town all over the northern part of Illinois (Illinois at that time was divided into but three congressional districts; the third, in which Sangamon County was included, being made up of the twenty-two northernmost counties), speaking six days out of seven. When the election came off in August, 1838, out of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> thousand votes cast, Stuart received a majority of only fourteen; but even that majority the Democrats always contended was won unfairly.

It is said to be the most elevated lake on the globe and has the distinction of being the only body of fresh water in which seals will live. In some places no bottom has been found. When the railroad was first built trains were taken across this lake on gigantic ferries. As the winters are long and cold, great ice-breakers were built to take the trains across during the winter time. It is actually said that these ice-breakers would slowly plow their way through <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> inches of ice. During the Russian-Japanese war these were too slow so they laid down heavy steel rails on the ice and all winter long trains were speeded across on this ice railway. Some time ago I made this statement in a lecture and as soon as the last word was spoken a Russian came forward saying: \"I was a soldier in the Russian army and walked across this lake on the ice and saw them laying the rails at the time. It was then nearly sixty below zero.\" Siberia is the...", "...Dec. 1, 1870._--Madame de Stael shows how she must have suffered when she wrote--'Le reveil, quel moment pour les malheureux!'

The country was then sparsely settled, and quite as many Indians were along the road as white people; still there were embryo towns all along the route, and a few farms sprinkled over the beautiful prairies. On reaching Indianola, near Topeka, I found everybody down with the chills and fever. My own driver became so shaky...", "...sixty).

The treasurer reported at this meeting, that the subscriptions already received amounted to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> pounds. As I had foreseen long before this time that my _Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species_ was too large for general circulation, and yet that a general circulation of knowledge on this subject was absolutely necessary, I determined directly after the formation of the committee to write a short pamphlet consisting only of eight or ten pages for this purpose.

At this age, I was transplanted to Cambridge, where I bloomed for two years in the blue and silver of a fellow commoner of Trinity.

The possible variations in such a classification of the impressions of the three fingers of the right hand cannot exceed thirty-six, and a thousand prints may therefore be indexed into one of these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> groups.

E., at the distance of seven or eight leagues; so that the whole extent of the port, north and south, is at least thirty miles. The extremity of the western arm bore S. 15 deg. 45' W., which makes the extent, east and west, to be <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> miles; but there was no communication with the sea on that side, nor did the western arm appear to be navigable beyond seven miles above where I had crossed it. Towards the interior there was a mountain bearing N. 11 deg.

The old gentleman was one of the selectmen of the town that year; and an old law, or municipal regulation, required that one or more of the selectmen should walk the town lines--follow round the town boundaries on foot--once a year, to see that the people of adjoining towns, or others, were not trespassing. The practice of walking the town lines is now almost or quite obsolete, but it was a needed precaution when inhabitants were few and when the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> square miles of a township consisted mostly of forest. At this time the southern half of our town was already taken up in farms, but the northern part was still in forest lots. The selectmen usually walked the north lines only. When the state domain, almost all dense forest, was first surveyed, the land was laid off in ranges, so-called, and tiers of lots. The various grants of land to persons for public services were also surveyed in a similar manner and the corners and...", "...amounted to an hour; hence the length of \"an instant,\" the loss per diem, can be found from the equation 1/2(3600 x 365)^2 instants = 1 hour; whence one \"instant\" equals the 240 millionth part of a second. This minute quantity represents the retardation of the earth per day. In a year the aggregate loss mounts up to 1/3600th part of a second, in a century to about three seconds, and in thirty-six centuries to an hour. But even at the end of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> centuries the day is barely any longer; it is only 3600 x 365 instants, that is 1/180th of a second, longer than it was at the beginning. And even a million years ago, unless the rate of loss was different (as it probably was), the day would only be thirty-five minutes shorter, though by that time the aggregate loss, as measured by the apparent lateness of any perfectly punctual event reckoned now, would have amounted to nine years.

When he has worked faithfully and capably for the stated period, he is awarded a federal bronze badge of honor. After January 1, 1918, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> days of eight hours each are to be required on the farm or in food production in order to earn the badge.

In the ten days since the opening of the offensive they had covered upwards of two hundred and fifty miles, a feat which for endurance alone on the part of men and horses has not been equalled in this War.

The currency plank, he thought, was unwise, that on the income tax unnecessary, that on the Court assailed the supreme tribunal, and the entire program was \"revolutionary.\" As yet, nobody had quite expressed the feelings of the convention. Tillman was too crude; Hill had no remedy for long-standing ills. At this juncture William J. Bryan stepped upon the platform. He was a young man--only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years of age--and known but slightly as a representative from Nebraska who possessed many of the arts and abilities of an orator. Bryan began with a modest and tactful declaration that his opposition to the gold wing of the party was based solely on principles and not at all on personalities. The convention had met, he insisted, not to debate but to register a judgment already rendered by the people. Old leaders had been cast aside because they had refused to express the...", "...millions to thirty-eight millions. The income-tax payers have increased from one million and a half to nearly eight millions.[8] Incomes between L150 and L1,000 have increased from three hundred thousand to nine hundred and ninety thousand.

The rich have been re-inforced by only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> thousand. On the other hand Mr Mallock is able to dispose of the fallacy that during the present reign the very richest class have grown richer still. In 1850 the incomes of fifty thousand pounds and upwards were seventy-two thousand; in 1897 they are nearer a hundred thousand; thus while the fairly well-to-do middle classes have increased by hundreds of thousands, the professional plutocrats measure their increase only by a few simple thousands.

Caulaincourt justly complained of this infraction of the law of nations and established usage, which, he said, was the sole cause of the delay in bringing the negotiations to a conclusion. After this complaint he communicated to the Congress the ostensible instructions of Napoleon, in which he authorised his Minister to accede to the demands of the Allies. But in making this communication M. de Caulaincourt took care not to explain the private and...", "...dislike of his volcanic relative was so deep-rooted that he was incapable of giving any recognition to him. And so in order to avoid a too obvious slight to his country's best known hymnwriter, he assigned the work to an already existing committee on liturgy, of which he himself was president.

It contained <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hymns of which six were written by Kingo, seven by Brorson, and one by Grundtvig, the latter being, as Grundtvig humorously remarked, set to the tune of the hymn, \"Lord, I Have Done Wrong.\" Mynster's influence was great enough to secure the supplement a wide circulation. The collection, nevertheless, failed to satisfy the need of the church.

On arriving at Madrid, Mr Bradlaugh waited upon Senor Castelar at the Government Palace, Plaza de Oriente, where he was officially received, and whence a few days later came a fairly lengthy official document, addressed to Mr R.

From Madrid he went to Lisbon, by way of Cuidad Real and Badajoz, the journey taking <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours by \"express\" train. His visit to Lisbon was upon private business: he particularly desired to learn something concerning a Portuguese gentleman, the Baron Geraldo F. dos Santos, with whom he had been connected in 1867 in the Naples Colour Company, and who had in the October of that year \"gone to Lisbon,\" leaving \"no orders,\" as was tersely written upon a bill for three hundred pounds when it became due.

Complaints have been made against the use of proxies in elections. Notably these complaints have been made respecting elections in the Mutual Life Insurance Company, a corporation which has no stock-holders, but which consists in a membership of its policy-holders. These policy-holders have the supreme control of the corporation in their own hands. Its government is by them delegated to a board of trustees <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> in number, divided into four classes of nine in each class. The term of office is four years, so that nine trustees go out of office in each year. This classification prevents the possibility of any sudden change of management, while it leaves all needed control in the hands of the policy-holders. If, for instance, dissatisfaction with the management exists, and nine new trustees are elected, it is not to be doubted but that the warning would be listened to and the necessary...", "...about Project Gutenberg (one page) We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.

From now on, he ate less and less of the store of insects: on the evening of the following day, he refused them altogether. About <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours after being bitten, the Mole died during the night, and certainly not from starvation, for there were still many live insects in the cage. The bite of my Tarantula is therefore dangerous to other animals than insects: it is fatal to the Sparrow, it is fatal to the Mole.

The plea put forward for their removal was founded on a report by Francis Price <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years before, wherein he considered them unsafe. When the Hungerford Chantry was added one of the outside buttresses of the Lady Chapel aisle was removed to make room for it; the opening pierced through the main walls of the cathedral into both the chapels were also sources of weakness.

The First President maintaining the legality of his imprisonment, Daurat, a councillor of the Third Chamber, told him...", "...the third, Corrado Trinci, escaped, and took a fearful vengeance on his enemy. By the help of Braccio da Montone he possessed himself of Nocera and all its inhabitants, with the exception of Pietro Rasiglia's wife, whom her husband flung from the battlements. Corrado then butchered the men, women, and children of the Rasiglia clan, to the number of three hundred persons, accomplishing his vengeance with details of atrocity too infernal to be dwelt on in these pages.

I had no room for desire, except it was of things which I had not, and they were but trifles, though indeed of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> pounds sterling; alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of business for it; and I often thought with myself, that I would have given an handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for an hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for six-penny-worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for an handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink: as it was, I had not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay...", "...celebrate a daring rescue.

When we recollect that London presents an area of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> square miles, covered with 21,600 square acres of bricks and mortar, and numbers more than 380,600 houses; that all the riches it contains are nightly threatened in every direction by an ever-present enemy; that the secret match, the spontaneous fire, and the hand of the drunkard, are busily at work; it is evident that nothing but a force the most disciplined, and implements the most effective, can be competent to cope with so sudden and persevering a foe.

It has since been extended with the public demand, until now (in 1892) there are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> miles of road, over which the trains sweep incessantly from the bay to the river, and from the river to the bay. The structures are not indeed the most graceful in the world, as they bestride the long avenues of the city.

These troops were generally volunteers from Connecticut and from the English settlements on Long Island. The fleet then ascended through the Narrows, and two of the frigates disembarked a number of regular troops just below Brooklyn, to support the volunteers. Two of the frigates, one mounting <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> guns, and the other thirty, coming up under full sail, passed directly within range of the guns of the fort, and cast anchor between the fort and Nutten or Governor's Island. Stuyvesant stood at one of the angles of the fortress as the frigates passed by. It was a critical moment. The fate of the city and the lives of its inhabitants trembled in the balance. The guns were loaded and shotted, and the gunners stood by with their burning matches. A word from the impetuous...", "...court. The purpose of Henry was obvious; so was the means, he thought. For it had occurred to him that Catherine was his elder brother's widow, and, therefore, had no right, by church law, to marry him. To be sure, a papal dispensation had been obtained from Pope Julius II authorizing the marriage, but why not now obtain a revocation of that dispensation from the reigning Pope Clement VII? Thus the marriage with Catherine could be declared null and void, and Henry would be a bachelor, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years of age, free to wed some princess, or haply Anne Boleyn. [Sidenote: Difficult Position of the Pope] There was no doubt that Clement VII would like to do a favor for his great English champion, but two difficulties at once presented themselves. It would be a most dangerous precedent for the pope to reverse the decision of one of his predecessors.

Wassermann's reaction usually yields a negative result in from three weeks to two months, but later may again become positive. Subsequent doses of the arsenical preparation are therefore usually indicated, and should be given in from 7 to 21 days according to the dose.

As he was travelling across Westleton Heath, with a load of corn to be ground at the Dunwich mill, it seemed that he heard voices calling feebly, and guided by them found these unhappy men half buried in the snow that had fallen on that day, and so rescued them from death.

As they have sometimes been accused of being land monopolists, it is curious to see that even at the highest amount I have given they would own only about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> acres per head, which is, for this country, a comparatively small holding of land. It is probably a low estimate of the wealth of the seventy-two communes to place it at twelve millions of dollars. This wealth is not equally divided, some of the older societies holding the larger share. But if it were, the members would be worth over two thousand dollars per head, counting men, women, and children. It is not an exaggeration to say that almost the whole of this wealth has...", "...of black potatoes, gray tea, and a guttering dish of fat pork.

At the finish of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> holes Vardon said, 'I never felt so fagged out in my life. In fact I could play seventy-two holes on the other side every day for a week and not have been fatigued half so much.'\" I do not remember that I ever committed myself to such an extravagant statement as this, but the course was certainly a very trying one that day.

You may frequently hear it said in America that \"as goes New York, so goes the country\"; which is to say that in a presidential election the party which carries New York will carry the nation. In theory this is not necessarily so, although it is evident that New York's thirty-six votes in the electoral college must be an important contribution to the support of a candidate. In practice it has proven itself a good rule, partly by reason of the importance of those <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> votes, but more, perhaps, because the popular impetus which sways one part of the country is likely to be felt in others--that, in fact, New York goes as the country goes.

For ace is thrown at the first throw once in six, or six in thirty-six times, and of those six, the die being cast again, ace will be thrown but once; being altogether once in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> times. The chance of the same cast three times successively is, by a similar reasoning, 1/6^3 or 1/216: that is, the event will happen, on a large average, only once in two hundred and sixteen throws.

In half an hour Cameron discarded his mitts and unbuttoned his skin-lined jacket.

Soon after his return from Vienna, the novelist was informed that a package from Vienna was held for him with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> francs due. Having, of course, no money, he sent his servant in a cab for the package, telling him where he could secure the money and, dead or alive, to bring the package. After spending four hours in an agony of anticipation, wondering what Madame Hanska could be sending him, his messenger arrived with a copy of _Pere Goriot_ which he had given her in Vienna with the request that she give it to some one to whom it might afford pleasure.

It was a good while before I could correctly explain to my own satisfaction the phenomena which at this time I was...", "...Richard Yorke was really dear to him. As for Richard, notwithstanding the seasonableness of the other's offer, and although he was himself almost convinced that without such aid he could never effect his object, no sooner was he left alone than he regretted that he had passed his word to put off the attempt another day. Suppose he should transgress some prison regulation between this and then, or be reported by his hostile attendant without having committed a transgression! There were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours of such perilous delay before him, and his impatience was already at fever-heat. By standing on his metal wash-stand, and peering through his bars, he could see that the coil of rope still lay in its accustomed place that afternoon, but would it remain there till to-morrow night? The very act of thus climbing to his window, which he could not resist, was a serious offense; and if by any chance he should be found in possession of the file--then all was over. He was...", "...Terrified by the report, the man who was guiding the British turned and fled. Colonel Hall, thus abandoned, led the way directly across the river; whereas the true ford inclined diagonally further down. Hall had to pass through deeper water, but he reached a part of the bank where it was unguarded. The American pickets, too, which had turned out at the alarm given by the sentinel, had to deliver a distant and slanting fire. Still it had its effect. Three of the British were killed, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> wounded. Colonel Hall pushed on gallantly, but was shot down as he ascended the bank. General Davidson hastened with his men towards the place where the British were landing. The latter formed as soon as they found themselves on firm ground, charged Davidson's men before he had time to get them in order, killed and wounded about forty, and put the rest to flight. General Davidson was the last to leave the ground, and was killed just as he was mounting his horse.

We can safely assume that this predisposed Michael Angelo in Cellini's favor, and was the foundation of the friendship which he afterward showed to the younger sculptor. From his eighteenth to his fortieth year Cellini lived mostly at Rome. He was employed by Pope Clement VII., the cardinals and Roman nobles. The Pope desired to have a cope button made and a magnificent diamond set in it. This jewel had cost Julius II. <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> thousand ducats. Many artists sent in designs for this button, and Clement chose that by Cellini. He used the diamond as a throne, and placed a figure of the Almighty upon it; the hand was raised as if in blessing, and many angels fluttered about the folds of the drapery, while various jewels were set around the whole. When other artists saw the design they did not believe that it could be executed successfully; but Cellini made it a perfect work of art and of beauty....", "...course at Versailles--produced some most exciting business. I have never seen a more extraordinary final in its way than that in the amateur event at La Boulie on this occasion, when Mr. E. A. Lassen came to grips with Lord Charles Hope--and such grips they were! I was led to describe it at the time as a dramatic affair of four periods and a spasm, and that is just what it was. Lord Charles Hope, though not physically strong, has acquired a fine game, and in the first period of this <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> holes match we witnessed him playing some quite beautiful golf and exercising the most complete self-possession and steadiness, gradually piling up a big lead of holes upon his more experienced opponent, who has been once Amateur Champion of Britain and a finalist another time, and seeming to make himself a certain winner. The duration of this period was one whole round, and at the end of it Lord Charles had five good holes to his advantage. The second was a period of peace,...", "...gentleman was, and I told him he was \"James Leach, Esquire, a Guardian, from Keighley.\" \"He's a funny fellow,\" said the governor, \"I couldn't tell whether he was coming in as a patient or not.\" By way of re-assurance I told the governor that Mr Leach had had a stroke, which rather accounted for his \"acting funny.\" The other members of the deputation had now arrived, and the whole were shown into a private room. There the Guardians sat as a Board, with Mr Middlebrook as chairman, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> lunatics from the Keighley Union were brought in. One or two of the patients I recognised. Several of them were ready to be discharged, having been passed by the doctor. The inspection over, Mr Leach expressed a desire to see the patients dine.

From this beginning the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically. The French army melted away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to Vyazma, from Vyazma to Smolensk, from Smolensk to the Berezina, and from the Berezina to Vilna- -independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the pursuit, the barring of the way, or any other particular conditions.

If a one-inch eyeglass can not be had, a two-inch eyeglass will answer quite well. The reason for having two tubes is that eyes differ, and that what is bought for a <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> inch glass may be an inch or two more or less than that, so that the smaller tube must be moved back and forth till the eye finds where the view is plainest.

There were always wood engravers, not very clever, capable only of working simple lines without charm. One of them resolved to resuscitate the art, and made various attempts about the end of the reign of Louis XIV. and beginning of that of Louis XV. He was named John Papillon, and was born at St. Quentin in 1661. His experiments did not go beyond a book of prayers, with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> figures in relief after Sebastien Leclerc. His son, John Baptist, succeeded him, and continued to engrave without ceasing subjects of ornament, letters, often tailpieces, of a good style upon the whole, and taking an excellent place in an elaborate book. Unfortunately, grace had fled; the processes that the practitioners exhibited one after the other were lost; and the Papillons reconstituted, we may say, a vanished art. John Baptist also published in 1766 a theoretical...", "...Washington had prophesied that the Alleghanies would soon be furnishing millstones equal to the best English burr. As he crossed the mountains Baily found that taverns charged the following schedule: breakfast, eighteen pence; dinner and supper from two shillings to two shillings and sixpence each. Traversing Laurel Hill, he reached Pittsburgh just at the time when it was awakening to activity as the trading center of the West. In order to descend the Ohio, Baily obtained a flatboat, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> feet long and twelve feet broad, which drew eighteen inches of water and was of ten tons burden. On the way downstream, Charleston and Wheeling were the principal settlements which Baily first noted.

Such, however, was the case. Ten out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> given by the Sultan ran away, because they feared that the white men, whom they believed to be cannibals, were only taking them into the interior to eat them; and one pagazi, more honest than the freed men, deposited his pay upon the ground, and ran away too.

They own thirteen hundred acres of land, much of which they let to tenants. They have a wool-factory, which is their only manufactory. This society was founded a year after that at Union Village; it had in 1825 one hundred members; and is now prosperous, pecuniarily, having no debt, and money at interest. One of its families once suffered a slight loss from a defalcation. The society at Whitewater has three families, and one...", "...was now about to close with triumph for the Americans and their cause. The little Continental Navy had fully justified the faith of the stout-hearted people by its grand performances. This little David had fought the Goliath of England most valiantly for seven years, and in the might of right its \"pebbles from the brook\" had been equal in efficiency to the huge \"spear\" of the boastful oppressor. Divine help gave final victory to the patriots. During the war the Americans had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> public vessels afloat, besides swarms of active and efficient privateers. They had also built a large 74-gun ship (the _America_), but before she was put to sea she was presented to the French government.

The militia, who had been treading on their rear, were no longer seen, but every house, every wall, and every tree the troops had to pass, sent forth upon them bullets and rifle shots; the Americans taking care not to expose their own persons to danger. When they reached Boston they had left behind them sixty killed, and forty-nine missing, in addition to which they had one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> wounded. The provincials had about fifty killed, and thirty-eight wounded; but their loss was more than compensated by the encouragement which this affair tended to give the Americans in general. Elated with the result, they termed it \"the glorious victory of Lexington;\" and they talked of nothing less than driving the king's troops from Boston, and restoring the liberty and trade of that town. Instead of an immediate assault, however, they formed themselves into a blockade....", "...he worked at it, as it were, red-hot, almost without rest or cessation, and they were rarely reluctant to help him. \"Now, you fellows!\" he would say, shutting himself and his workmen up in a room on the top flat, \"I've locked the door, and you'll have to stay here until this job is completed.\" During sixty hours, perhaps, he would take no sleep and little food, while his brain would work at highest pressure until the thing was wrought. Then he would relax, and sleep for as long as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours at a stretch. And now his fame had spread far and wide. The people at Menlo Park, to which he removed--some twenty-four miles from New York--began to look upon him as a wizard--a man possessing magical powers. It seemed to them there was nothing he could not do. Exaggerated tales of his wonderful powers spread over the country. \"If people track me here,\" he said (he had been besieged at Newark), \"I shall simply have to take to the woods.\" Child after child was...", "...in honour of the birth-day of the Saviour, certain chambers were discharged at our English factory, which were answered by ordnance from our ships.

The arrival of the canoes from Canada was to be the signal for my departure, and I looked forward to their appearance with great impatience. In a few days the canoes arrived; and on the 4th of June, 1843, I started, in company with several other gentlemen, in two north canoes. These light, graceful craft were about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> feet long, by from five to six broad, and were capable of containing eight men and three passengers.

His second son and fellow-painter died of the same plague which struck down Titian, in 1566, at the ripe age of eighty-nine years.

Perhaps some poetic aspirant may read these pages, and if he does, he may accept a word of advice. The difficulty in publishing poems is to get them fully and fairly read and considered by some publisher of real eminence in the trade.

As my studies progressed, however, I found it would be necessary to widen my field. The Canadian post office did not come into being as an independent organization. It was but the extension into newly-acquired territories, of a system which had been in operation for nearly three-quarters of a century, with well-established modes of administration. Obviously, either reference should be made to well-known works on the older colonial postal system, or an account of it...", "...overcome by a nervous terror of the responsibility of the office, that he committed suicide, by throwing himself out of a window on the 6th of April.

In a fatal moment he consented: after this, he never had a moment's peace, and little or no sleep; this brought on a slow nervous fever, but not to...", "...by thorough cultivation during the pupating stage to break the cells and crush the pupae, thus preventing the emergence of the beetles.

Seventy-one persons were also found wounded; of these, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> were Europeans, two Turks, and thirty-three natives. Of those killed or wounded, some had received stabs on their bodies, but the majority had their injuries inflicted by naboots.

Later, this barricade was partially demolished by a shell, and Harmon actually repaired it while under fire from a machine gun only sixty yards away! Of the party, in whose company Harmon first went out, six of the twelve sappers were wounded, and of the fifty infantrymen six were killed and twenty-four wounded.

But Rosa had forbidden it under pain of not returning; Rosa had forbidden the least mention of the tulip for three days. That meant seventy-two hours given to the lover to be sure; but it was seventy-two hours stolen from the horticulturist. There was one consolation: of the seventy-two hours during which Rosa would not allow the tulip to be mentioned, thirty-six had passed already; and the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> would pass quickly enough: eighteen with waiting for the evening's interview, and eighteen with rejoicing in its remembrance. Rosa came at the same hour, and Cornelius submitted most heroically to the pangs which the compulsory silence concerning the tulip gave him. His fair visitor, however, was well aware that, to command on the one point, people must yield on another; she therefore no longer drew back her hands from the grating, and even allowed Cornelius tenderly to...", "...of which rose here and there the taper shaft of a minaret, or the dome of a mosque or bath. From the southern side of the citadel, we looked down into the gorge which supplies Kiutahya with water--a wild, desert landscape of white crags and shattered peaks of gray rock, hanging over a narrow winding bed of the greenest foliage. Instead of taking the direct road to Brousa, we decided to make a detour of two days, in order to visit the ruins of the old Greek city of OEzani, which are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> miles south of Kiutahya. Leaving at noon, we ascended the gorge behind the city, by delightfully embowered paths, at first under the eaves of superb walnut-trees, and then through wild thickets of willow, hazel, privet, and other shrubs, tangled together with the odorous white honeysuckle. Near the city, the mountain-sides were bare white masses of gypsum and other rock, in many places with the purest chrome-yellow hue; but as we advanced they were clothed to the summit with...", "...stand, so quick was he in his retorts, that the agency, when the strike ended by a compromise ten days later, took him on as one of their own operatives. Thus James Blake became a private detective. He was at first disappointed in the work. It seemed, at first, little better than his old job as watchman and checker. But the agency, after giving him a three-week try out at picket work, submitted him to the further test of a \"shadowing\" case. That first assignment of \"tailing\" kept him <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours without sleep, but he stuck to his trail, stuck to it with the blind pertinacity of a bloodhound, and at the end transcended mere animalism by buying a tip from a friendly bartender.

It seemed to the Northern people a most reasonable line to establish between the sections. But the Ohio pursues a south-west instead of a due west course. By following it, the South had lost two and a half degrees of territory. The Mason and Dixon line is about thirty-nine degrees and thirty minutes north latitude, while the mouth of the Ohio is at thirty-seven degrees. By extending the interstate boundary line nearest the mouth--viz., that between Kentucky and Tennessee at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> degrees and thirty minutes--the slavery section would lose a strip across the Louisiana Purchase as wide as the State of Kentucky at its greatest width. Thus even the natural features of the continent seemed to cry out against drawing sectional lines for a united people. For this reason the Southern element demanded that the continuation of the line between slavery and free soil should be drawn along the northern boundary of the proposed State, which was about one degree...", "...convicts, stores, and provisions on board; and on the 16th the _Admiral Barrington_, the last of the ten sail of transports, anchored in the cove.

She had on board a captain and a party of the New South Wales corps, with two hundred and sixty-four male convicts, four free women, and one child. She had been unhealthy too, having lost <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> convicts in the passage, and brought in eighty-four persons sick, who were immediately landed. Her stores and proportion of provisions were the same as on board of the other ships. The whole number of convicts now received into the colony, including thirty on board the _Gorgon_, were, male convicts one thousand six hundred and ninety-five; female convicts one hundred and sixty-eight; and children nine.

Tallard garrisoned Blenheim with twenty-six battalions of French infantry and twelve squadrons of French cavalry. Marsin and the Elector had twenty-two battalions of infantry and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> squadrons of cavalry in front of the village of Luetzingen. The centre was occupied by fourteen battalions of infantry, including the celebrated Irish brigade. These were posted in the little hamlet of Oberglau, which lies somewhat nearer to Luetzingen than to Blenheim. Eighty squadrons of cavalry and seven battalions of foot were ranged between Oberglau and Blenheim.

Mr. Thayer doubts this story, because he could not find anything in Beethoven's sketch-books corroborating it; but even if it should be a myth, there are many well authenticated facts which show that Beethoven, like other composers, owed many of his best ideas to the magic influence of love in stimulating his mental powers.

He had already been met by the news of the reception that awaited him at Jamestown from Sir William. His army consisted now of only one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> tired-out, soiled, tattered and hungry men--not a very formidable array with which to attack the fortified town, held by his wrathful enemy and the six hundred fresh men-at-arms from Accomac.

But a new opportunity presented itself; his imagination caught fire, and he foresaw a fortune, an assured fortune which nothing could take from him,--and once again he laughed his deep, sonorous, powerful laugh, defying destiny. In September, 1827, a type foundry was offered for sale, after having failed, and Balzac, in conjunction with Barbier and the assignee Laurent, bought it for the sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> thousand francs. Mme. de Berny, with her inalienable devotion, joined with him in the new venture, contributing nine thousand francs as her share. The business of the foundry had hitherto been limited to the production of fonts of type, but it was the ambition of the partners to extend its scope to engraving on steel, copper and wood, and to a special method of stereotyping invented by Pierre Duronchail, to which they had acquired the rights. A catalogue reproducing the...", "...truth.' What could the jury do, after these burning words, but acquit the prisoner? They did acquit him, and from this famous trial dates, according to Gouverneur Morris, the dawn of the American Revolution, which myriads of Englishmen, whatever may be thought or said to the contrary by persons who wish to raise bad blood between two mighty countries, delight to acknowledge as glorious. But the progress of the press in America was slow under British rule, for in 1775 there were only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> journals in the various States altogether.

As a matter of fact, the rolling apparatus did break down several times. \"At first,\" as Mr. Stevens in a letter to his father, which I have seen, described it, \"the rails came from the rolls twisted and as crooked as snakes,\" and he was greatly discouraged. At last, however, the mill men acquired the art of straightening the rail while it cooled. The first shipment,[3] consisting of five hundred and fifty bars eighteen feet long, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> pounds to the yard, arrived in Philadelphia on the ship Charlemagne, May 16, 1831. Over thirty miles of this rail was laid before the summer of 1832. A few years after, on much of the Stevens rail laid on the Camden and Amboy Railroad, the rivets at the joints were discarded, and the bolt with the screw thread and nut, similar to that now used, was adopted as the standard. The rail was first designed to weigh thirty-six pounds per yard, but it was almost immediately...", "...draw his army from the baseline of the enemy, the Missouri River, ordered his troops to the southwestern portion of the State.

On departing from Periapatam, the small ships and flat-bottomed boats go always together, and on arriving at the shoals about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> miles from that place, they are forced through by the winds, which always blow so forcibly that they have no means of taking shelter during the passage.

We had a great many thousand stand of arms, and two magazines full of powder and ammunition, prepared and partially prepared for service; that is, the powder in the shells, the powder in the cartridges, two large magazines full.

This provision of law is the \"Missouri Compromise.\" In excluding slavery north of the line, the same language is employed as in the Ordinance of 1787.

A fresh examination of the Babylonian dynastic tablet has led Professor Delitzsch to make some alterations in the published account of what Professor Maspero calls the ninth dynasty.

The first of the kings reigned <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years, and he had a predecessor belonging to the previous dynasty whose name has been lost. There would consequently have been two Elamite usurpers instead of one.

The encounter took place on the heath of Mook (April 14) and ended in the crushing defeat of the invaders. Lewis and his young brother, Henry, and Duke Christopher perished, and their army was completely scattered. The death of his brothers was a great grief to William. Lewis had for years been his chief support, and the loss of this dauntless champion was indeed a heavy blow to the cause for which he had sacrificed his life. He was only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years of age, while Henry, the youngest of the Nassaus, to whom the Prince was deeply attached, was but a youth of twenty-four. The invasion of Lewis had nevertheless the result of raising the siege of Leyden; but only for a time.

He then commenced a new series of important works, of which \"Christ Healing the Sick\" was purchased by an institution in Great Britain for L3,000, and was subsequently copied for the Pennsylvania Hospital. \"Penn's Treaty with the Indians\" was painted for Granville Penn, the scene representing the founding of Pennsylvania.

In December, through Spener's influence, Francke accepted an invitation to fill the chair of Greek and oriental languages in the new university of Halle, which was at that time being organized by the elector Frederick III. of Brandenburg; and at the same time, the chair having no salary attached to it, he was appointed pastor of Glaucha in the immediate neighbourhood of the town. He afterwards became professor of theology. Here, for the next <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years, until his death on the 8th of June 1727, he continued to discharge the twofold office of pastor and professor with rare energy and success. At the very outset of his labours he had been profoundly impressed with a sense of his responsibility towards the numerous outcast children who were growing up around him in ignorance and crime. After a number of tentative plans, he resolved in 1695 to institute what is often called a \"ragged school,\" supported by public charity....", "...Generals; that the reserve had no other reason for being than to find a soft job for some potentate near to the golf links of the coast. But whether it was just a guess or a bit of far-seeing on the part of Sir Travers Clarke, that G.H.Q.

Very nobly the Motor Transport--including that reserve--did its duty. There were drivers who held the wheel for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours at a stretch, and were lifted from their seats fainting or asleep; a few--who carried on until no longer able to see through their bloodshot and torturing eyes--ran their cars into trees or walls or ditches.

After all allowances had been made for the effects of precession and other displacements of a star's position which were produced by motions of the earth, it was found that there were still small outstanding differences which must be due to the motion of the star itself--its proper motion. The quantity of this motion was not well known for any star when HERSCHEL'S researches began. Before they were concluded, however, MASKELYNE had deduced the proper motions of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> stars--the fundamental stars, so called--which included in their number _Sirius_, _Procyon_, _Arcturus_, and generally the brightest stars. It is _a priori_ evident that stars, in general, must have proper motions, when once we admit the universality of gravitation. That any fixed star should be entirely at rest would require that the attractions on all sides of it should be exactly balanced. Any change in the position of this star would break up this balance, and thus, in...", "...when it was expected the House would be more excited than usual, and then M. de Beaufort, seeing one end of the weapon peeping out of my pocket, exposed it to M. le Prince's captain of the guards and others, saying, \"See, gentlemen, the Coadjutor's prayer-book.\" I understood the jest, but really I could not well digest it.

Mary became this; and I wish to Heaven she had rather died in an hospital! Her lover polluted her soul as well as her beauty: he found her another lover when he was tired of her. When she was at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> I met her in Paris, with a daughter of sixteen. I was then flush with money, frequenting salons, and playing the part of a fine gentleman. She did not know me at first; and she sought my acquaintance.

Yet they suffered much from the extreme cold, and at times from hunger, for it was hard to hunt in the winter weather, and the game was thin and poor. Generally game could be killed in a day's hunt from the fort; but occasionally small parties of hunters went off for a trip of several days, and returned laden with meat; in one case they killed thirty-two deer, eleven elk, and a buffalo; in another forty deer, sixteen elk, and three buffalo; <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> deer and fourteen elk, etc., etc. The buffalo remaining in the neighborhood during the winter were mostly old bulls, too lean to eat; and as the snows came on most of the antelope left for the rugged country farther west, swimming the Missouri in great bands.

From this place to Reykjavik a road has been constructed--a rough one at best, but still a road; the only one of any length in all Iceland, for it is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> miles long. It commences just below the lower fall of the Oxara; after a short ascent, a bridge crosses the river between the waterfall and the Murderesses' Pool, whence it rises by a steep ascent to the level of the country above the rift. This part of the road has been cut in the side of the fissure of Almanna-gja.

Each of the four purchasers had his separate portion, and each had a right to the water for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours per week. Signor Bonaudo went round with his hind at once, and saw that the dams in the ducts were so opened or closed that his own land was being irrigated.

As it is important, in many experiments, to know the exact time that the three species of bees exist before assuming their ultimate form, I shall here subjoin my own observations on the point. The worm of workers passes three days in the egg, five in the vermicular state, and then the bees close up its cell with a wax covering. The worm now begins spinning its coccoon, in which operation <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours are consumed. In three days, it changes to a nymph, and passes six days in this form. It is only on the twentieth day of its existence, counting from the moment the egg is laid, that it attains the fly state. The royal worm also passes three days in the egg, and is five a worm; the bees then close its cell; and it immediately begins spinning the coccoon, which occupies twenty-four hours. The tenth and eleventh day it remains in complete repose, and even sixteen hours...", "...the misfortune to be engaged in what is called \"an affair of honour,\" it is best to toss up to see if you should follow the law or the custom; and as the law and the custom in regard to duelling are contradictory, the magistrates would also do well to frame their sentence on the throw of the dice.

Since her brother's death she had confined herself to simple prose, and for this purpose she kept an ample journal. All this is mentioned to show that at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> Margaret Mackenzie was still a young woman. She had resolved that she would not content herself with a lifeless life, such as those few who knew anything of her evidently expected from her. Harry Handcock had thought to make her his head nurse; and the Tom Mackenzies had also indulged some such idea when they gave her that first invitation to come and live in Gower Street.

Kruzenstern now entered the Corea Channel, and determined the longitude of Tsusima, obtaining a difference of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> minutes from the position assigned to that island by La Perouse. This difference was subsequently confirmed by Dagelet, who can be fully relied upon. The Russian explorer noticed, as La Perouse had done before him, that the deviation of the magnetic needle is but little noticeable in these latitudes. The position of Sangar Strait, between Yezo and Niphon, being very uncertain, Kruzenstern resolved to determine it.

For about twenty minutes, as will be noticed, the arrivals were at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> a minute. Throughout the thickest of the flight I could keep a lookout upon only one side of me, and, moreover, the gathering darkness was by that time making it more and more difficult to see any birds except such as passed above the dark tree line; and from what went on just about me, it was evident that the number of arrivals was increasing rather than diminishing as my count fell off.

This Manikus failed to do, and to escape vengeance he migrated north of the Limpopo.

Pop, whose proper name was Moses, and who was a deacon in the African Methodist Church, made his living this way and that way. He did odd jobs for people, and he fished and hunted when fishing and hunting were in season.

At six cents a quart he would profit <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> cents by his walk of six miles and his work of a half-day. The sun was scorching and Pop was tired. He decided to rest in the barren field, at its very edge in shade of the woods. He climbed the zigzag fence with some labour and at the expense of a few of his cherries.

NEW DISTRIBUTION OF THE ARMY. The siege of Metz had formed no part of the original plan of campaign; it had been intended to do no more than merely to maintain an observation on the place when the main army should have passed it on the advance towards Paris; and a Reserve Division, consisting of eighteen battalions, sixteen squadrons, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> guns, detailed for that duty, was now near at hand. Under the altered conditions, however, the regular investment of Metz was now necessary, and this involved a radical alteration of the existing arrangements throughout the whole army. A separate army under the command of Prince Frederick Charles, consisting of the Ist, VIIth, and VIIIth Corps of the former Ist Army, the IInd, IIIrd, IXth, and Xth Corps of the IInd Army, the Reserve Division and the 1st and 3rd Cavalry...", "...on which was the single word \"Resurgam.\" All present took it as a good omen.

During those thirty-five years the great freemason's hands had been full, and in the City which rose from the ashes of the fire of 1666 no less than fifty-four churches were either built or restored by him. In addition, we find that the rebuilding or restoration of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> halls of the City guilds, as well as upwards of fifty notable buildings--hospitals, colleges, palaces, cathedrals and churches--in London and the provinces, is laid to his credit. St. Paul's Cathedral, Wren's City churches, and the Monument, would in themselves make London famous amongst the cities of the world. The Monument was erected to commemorate the rebuilding of the City. The inscription thereon absurdly attributes the origin of the fire to the Papists. Pope...", "...armies of heroes.

Everywhere in Europe also this fact was corroborated, and in some places even a seventh oscillation was recorded. The Greenwich record shows that the air-waves took about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours to travel from pole to pole, thus proving that they travelled at about the rate of ordinary sound-waves, which, roughly speaking, travel at the rate of between six and seven hundred miles an hour.

And added to the white-hot intensity of their struggle, was the question that for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours could not by either side be answered: was victory still possible?

The totality of the London porter exhibits but very slight differences, both with respect to strength or quantity of spirit, and solid extractive matter, contained in a given bulk of it.

The country-brewed porter is seldom well fermented, and seldom contains so large a quantity of spirit; it usually abounds in mucilage; hence it becomes turbid when mixed with alcohol. Such beer cannot keep, without becoming sour. It has been matter of frequent complaint, that ALL the porter now brewed, is not what porter was formerly. This idea may be true with some exceptions.

A force of only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> men could be spared from Fort Winchester, and these were placed under the command of Lieutenant Baldwick, an old Indian fighter. With the whites went nine Indians, who, after some little urging, consented to act under White Buffalo, although they belonged to a different tribe. Washington was greatly tempted to take command himself but felt that he would soon be needed in other directions. The rangers chosen for this expedition were all on horseback, and Lieutenant Baldwick...", "...the comforting reply that it was no more than what he had expected, as the press of sail the (French) fleet carried on the 9th, and on the night of the 8th, made it very clear to him what de Grasse's intentions were.

One of these fires was larger than the others, which they called \"Old Meg,\" and around this the farm servants, with their families and friends,...", "...distant, which we took to be the island of St. Catherine's.

The League, furious at this stroke of policy, tried to impose a council of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> advisers upon the king. But the deputies of the third estate did not support the other two orders, and the latter in their turn refused the king money for making war on the heretics, desiring, they said, not war but the destruction of heresy.

William had been compelled to dig and delve, to earn bread and butter, clothing and luxuries, houses and land, education and ease for H.B. Dickinson, of Richmond. William smarted frequently; but what could he do? Complaint from a slave was a crime of the deepest dye. So William dug away mutely, but continued to think, nevertheless. He was a man of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years of age, of dark chestnut color, medium size, and of pleasant manners to say the least. His owner was a tobacco manufacturer, who held some thirty slaves in his own right, besides hiring a great many others. William was regularly employed by day in his master's tobacco factory.

The extent of the valleys is about twelve Italian miles, making a square of about twenty-four French leagues. The valleys are three in number, Luzern, Perouse, and St. Martin. The former (in which the chief town is now Catholic,) is the most beautiful and extensive, and contains the five parishes of Rora, St. Jean, La Tour, Villar, and Bobbi, through the three last of which runs the rapid Pelice, which has its source near the Pra...", "...and were well calculated to produce an effect on the mind of Napoleon III.; and we are convinced that they furnish a key to his conduct toward Austria, and set forth the occasion of the Italian War.

The subjects of Francis Joseph would number sixty millions, while those of Napoleon III. would remain at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> millions. The sinews of war have never been much at the command of Austria, but possession of Italy would render her wealthy, and enable her to command that gold which moves armies and renders them effective. Her commerce would be increased to an incalculable extent, and she would have naval populations from which to conscribe the crews for fleets that she would be prompt to build. Her voice would be potential in the East, and that of France would there cease to be heard....", "...comfort and confidence to a man in naked destitution; the truths which are so familiar to us that we never think about them, may raise the utterly ignorant to a sense of their human brotherhood. Above all, in the exercise of our intellectual charities, let us accustom ourselves to feel satisfied with humble results and small successes; and here let me make a confession which may be of some possible use to others. When a young man, I taught a drawing-class gratuitously, beginning with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> pupils, who dwindled gradually to eleven. Soon afterwards I gave up the work from dissatisfaction, on account of the meagre attendance. This was very wrong--the eleven were worth the thirty-six; and so long as one of the eleven remained I ought to have contentedly taught him. The success of a teacher is not to be measured by the numbers whom he immediately influences.

This was in September, 1807. The fool and the fool's fire-ship became the butt of all sensible people in Europe as well as in America. Victor Hugo remarks that, \"In the year 1807, when the first steamboat of Fulton, commanded by Livingston, furnished with one of Watts's engines sent from England, and manoeuvred, besides her ordinary crew, by two Frenchmen only, Andr Michaux and another, made her first voyage from New York to Albany, it happened that she set sail on...", "...poor is the mental apparatus of the average man.

The crypt discovered in the Via Latina contained five rows of niches of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> each. The rows were called _sortes_, the niches _loci_. Now, as each shareholder was entitled to five _loci_, one on each row, lots were drawn only in regard to the _locus_, not to the row.

The Swedish fleet, being much inferior in numbers, was forced to retire under shelter of the fortress of Waxholm, which guards the access to the capital.

It is one hundred and ninety-six feet in length, by one hundred in width, with a spire rising in the air two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> feet. It is of brick, and is imposing only on account of its size. Its interior, however, is finished and decorated in a style surpassed by few churches in the country.

For two hundred years it was the common burial ground of the settlement, and here, probably, all the early colonists sleep their last sleep, though their graves...", "...descendants of the elephant become the rightful successors. Admit the principle, and the conclusion is perfectly correct. It is said that the divine elephant was nine standard feet in height. You reasonably suppose that the gate of his stable should be above nine feet in height, in order to admit his entering with ease. He consumed twenty pounds of rice every day, and twenty pounds of sugar, and drank twenty-five pounds of water. You find, by using your arithmetic, that he swallows <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> thousand five hundred pounds weight in the course of a year; it is impossible to reckon more correctly. But did your elephant ever, in fact, exist? Was he the emperor's brother-in-law? Had his wife a child by this left-handed union? This is the matter to be investigated.

Crouched there, I saw everything that...", "...\"Now that you bring the thing to my recollection,\" said Fritz, \"the idea of applying steam in the arts is by no means new, although, I must candidly admit, I never heard of it being used in propelling ships before.

They quickly removed his clothing and treated his leg, straightening it a little. And he was completely unaware of everything they did for him, because he was unconscious for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours.

In May, 1778, the American frigate Randolph, (so called in honor of Peyton Randolph, president of congress,) carrying <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> guns and three hundred and five men, sailed on a cruise from Charleston. The Yarmouth, British man-of-war, of sixty-four guns, discovered her and five other vessels, and came up with her in the evening.

In her hold were leaguers or huge water-casks filled with water; a large supply of wood and provisions, especially of farina, on which slaves are chiefly fed. Then there was the slave-deck, scarcely <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> inches in height, and large coppers for boiling the slaves' food, and some hundred pairs of slave irons or manacles for confining their legs or arms; indeed, nothing was wanting to condemn her.

Nearly all the pepper is sent to Singapore in small trading-boats, and is bought up there for the London and Calcutta markets.

In his opinion, a good vocabulary and a thorough knowledge of the verbs were the two essentials in teaching French.

And he was so little suggestive of drama, that it hardly occurred to her to think with any detail how his life of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years had been passed: in general, she imagined him always cold and dignified, not likely ever to have committed himself. He had hunted the tiger--had he ever been in love or made love? The one experience and the other seemed alike remote in Gwendolen's fancy from the Mr. Grandcourt who had come to Diplow in order apparently to make a chief epoch in her destiny--perhaps by introducing her to that state of marriage which she had resolved to make a state of greater freedom...", "...the arms of Portugal were for the first time surmounted by an imperial crown. This banner was solemnly blessed by the archbishop in the cathedral of Lisbon on the 14th of June, and the king then considered that all was ready. On the 24th of June, 1578, King Sebastian set sail with a fleet of fifty ships of war and about nine hundred transports under the command of the Admiral of Portugal, Dom Diogo de Sousa, carrying fifteen thousand infantry, two thousand four hundred cavalry, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> guns. Of this army only about ten thousand were Portuguese, the rest consisting of Spanish and German volunteers and mercenaries, and of nine hundred Italians, under the command of a gallant Englishman, Sir Thomas Stukeley. This well-known English Catholic, who had been created Marquis of Leinster by the Pope, had been stopped with his soldiers by Sebastian while on his way to raise an insurrection in Ireland against Elizabeth.

As a matter of fact, Scheikowitz had discovered Elkan lying on the sofa at his boarding place, vainly attempting to secure his first few minutes' sleep in over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours; and he had gone home truly shocked at Elkan's pallid and careworn appearance, though Elkan had promised to keep the appointment with Fischko. Polatkin felt convinced, however, that his partner must have discovered the pretence of Elkan's indisposition, and his manner was a trifle artificial when he inquired after the absentee. \"How was he feeling, Philip?\" he asked. \"Pretty bad, I guess,\" Scheikowitz replied, whereat a blank expression came over Polatkin's face....", "...There are facts known which point to the cause of this state of affairs. It is not uncommon for small cones of scoriae to be seen following lines on the flanks or at the base of a great volcanic mountain. These are undoubtedly lines of fissure, caused by the subterranean forces. In fact, such fissures have been seen opening on the sides of Mount Etna, in whose bottom could be seen the glowing lava. Along these fissures, in a few days, scoriae cones appeared; on one occasion no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> in number. It is believed by geologists that the linear systems of volcanoes are ranged along similar lines of fissure in the earth's crust--enormous breaks, extending for thousands of miles, and the result of internal energies acting through vast periods of time.

In April 1754 she was arrested on a charge of perjury or false swearing, and sent to stand her trial at the Old Bailey.

One evening towards dusk, as Matayemon was walking in the quarter where the enemy were staying, he saw a man, dressed as a gentleman's servant, enter a cook-shop and order some buckwheat porridge for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> men, and looking attentively at the man, he recognized him as the servant of Sakurai Jiuzayemon; so he hid himself in a dark place and watched, and heard the fellow say-- \"My master, Sakurai Jiuzayemon, is about to start for Sagara to-morrow morning, to return thanks to the gods for his recovery from a sickness from which he has been suffering; so I am in a great hurry.\" With these words the servant hastened away; and Matayemon, entering the shop, called for some...", "...a stave, to which those barbarians likened its columns.

The middle bed is composed of basaltic columns, placed vertically on the plane of their bed, and of unequal depth, varying from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> to fifty-four feet. The upper stratum consists of amorphous and tufaceous trap, intermixed with small basaltic veins and columns, and by its inequality and depth forms the contour of the island, whose surface is covered with turf, and presents nothing remarkable.

The laying lasts barely half an hour. I have seen it last <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours with Sitares. This quickness of the Mylabris points to an incomparably less numerous family. The hiding-place is next closed.

They deliberately tell the unfortunate golfer, or would-be golfer, that good putters are born and not made, that putting cannot be taught, and that each person must be left to work out his own salvation.

The man who gets down in two every time is not a bad putter. This allows him <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> strokes on the green, which is exactly one-half of his score. Now what does this statement which is made by Braid, Vardon, and Taylor amount to? It is an assertion by them that they are unable to teach half of the game of golf, and _that_ the most important half, for, as we have seen, Taylor says that it is \"the most important factor of success.\" Now surely there is something wrong here.

Thus, if the directions read \"cook to two hundred and thirty-eight degrees,\" the confectioner who has no thermometer will stop the cooking when a portion of the mass will \"form a 'soft ball' in cold water.\" If the directions read two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> degrees, the \"soft ball\" must be softer; if two hundred and forty degrees, the \"soft ball\" not so soft. Thus, without the thermometer, the thermometer readings form a scale which makes easier the application of the old tests.

It is certain that the sun is a globe revolving upon its axis in a period of twenty-five days, nine hours, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> minutes. This is known by the motion of dark spots upon its surface. The appearance of the sun as seen through a telescope is that of a globe of fire, its surface often in a state of violent agitation and flecked here and there with dark, irregular, changeable spots. These spots are sometimes of enormous dimensions--thirty thousand or fifty thousand miles in diameter. They present a dark centre with a narrow border or penumbra of lighter shade.

His figure was tall and shapely, and few could have encountered the brightness of his large gray eye, brilliant as polished steel.

In the only reports published by the Germans during this month it was claimed that they had destroyed or put out of action <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hostile machines.

His letters were those of a shrewd observer and depicted a situation that bristled with perplexity. The Algerines had about a dozen vessels, their armament ranging from ten to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> guns, but of these vessels only two belonged to the Government, the others being private ventures. Though they preyed on merchantmen, they avoided engagements, and did not come out at all if there were vessels cruising for them. A blockade was effective only while it lasted. Whenever it was raised, out came the Corsairs again. An occasional bombardment of their port did not cow them and had no permanent effect.

Paul noted that in four women who were habitually exposed to the influence of lead, and had fifteen pregnancies, ten terminated by abortion, two by premature confinement, three went the full term, but one of the three children was born dead, a second only lived twenty-four hours; so that, out of the whole fifteen, one only lived fully. In another observation of M. Paul's, five women had two natural confinements before being exposed to lead. After exposure, the history of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> pregnancies of these women is as follows:--there were twenty-six abortions (from two to five months), one premature confinement, two infants born dead, and five born alive, four of whom died in the first year.

They were provided with arms, and were directed to allow no Indian canoe to come alongside on any pretext whatever.

It was, after all, but a small party should we encounter any large band of Indians, who were not likely to attack us unless far superior to us in force.

No Chicago \"cannery\" ever rivalled such a result. The speed of assassination is the more remarkable when we consider the difficulties of attack. The beetle has no endless chain to seize its victim by one leg, hoist it up, and swing it along to the butcher's knife; it has no sliding plank to hold the victim's head beneath the pole-axe of the knacker; it has to fall upon its prey, overpower it, and avoid its feet and its mandibles.

We insist, therefore, that the successful farmer must be a specialist. He must devote his time to special more than to general farm work. You ask me to outline in detail the idea thus advanced.

Farmer B. devotes his entire attention to dairying and has invested in dairy cows as much money as A. has in all his stock. Is it not evident that though each farmer began life the same year, the latter man will make the most money, providing the section he is in demands dairy work? It seems to me so.

The principal measure in the Cabinet in 1785 was a Bill for the reform of the representation in Parliament, by which Mr. Pitt proposed to transfer the franchises of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> boroughs to counties and unrepresented towns. A clause in this Bill, for giving pecuniary compensation to the disfranchised boroughs, was fatal to its reception. Mr. Fox laid down the maxim, that the franchise was not a property, but a trust: the House adopted that view of the question, and the Bill was lost. But Mr. Pitt, nevertheless, discharged his pledge to the public by thus initiating the principle of parliamentary reform. The Marquis of Buckingham still continued a...", "...hot-foot to Guida.

One page contained an account of the execution of Louis XVI; another reported the fight between the English <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> gun frigate Araminta and the French Niobe. The engagement had been desperate, the valiant Araminta having been fought, not alone against odds as to her enemy, but against the irresistible perils of a coast upon which the Admiralty charts gave cruelly imperfect information. To the Admiralty we owed the fact, the journal urged, that the Araminta was now at the bottom of the sea, and its young commander confined in a French fortress, his brave and distinguished services lost...", "...the house of the ferryman who had taken him across on his trip South.

The only one suggested is that clause in the fifth article of the amendments of the Constitution which declares that no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.

For the past <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours my anxiety for her had put aside every other feeling. I had not thought of myself, and therefore not of my love for her; but now my selfish instinct woke again in full force.

In little more than a year he wrote nearly all the the poetry that has made him famous.

During his later years he did hack work for papers, gave occasional lectures, wrote critical and philosophical prose, and became a talker almost as noted as Dr. Johnson. It is only just to Coleridge to recognize the fact that even if he had never written a line of poetry, his prose would entitle him to be ranked among England's greatest critics.

They drank about four feet of stovepipe or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> cents' worth, then they danced and sang for me in a circle, old men and boys, then drilled with their carbines, and I showed them my revolver and field-glasses and themselves in the finder of the camera; and when I had to go they took me on their shoulders and marched me around waving their rifles.

Every pinch, with the agreeable ceremony of blowing and wiping the nose, and other incidental circumstances, consumes a minute and a half.

One day out of every ten amounts to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> days and a half in a-year. Hence, if we suppose the practice to be persisted in forty years, two entire years of the snuff-taker's life will be dedicated to tickling his nose, and two more to blowing it. The expense of snuff, snuff-boxes, and handkerchiefs, will be the subject of a second essay, in which it will appear, that this luxury encroaches as much on the income of the snuff-taker as it does on his time; and that by a proper application of the time and money thus lost...", "...and his successors holding the place of God), Perpetual Poverty, Chastity and Obedience; and according to it a peculiar care in the education of boys, according to the manner expressed in the Apostolic Letter and Constitutions of the said Society.\" The lay brothers leave out the clause concerning education.

Several expeditions had been directed against them, but always in vain; and when in 1754 the chief of that date, Tulaji Angria, known to Europeans as the Pirate, burnt two large Dutch vessels of fifty and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> guns respectively, and captured a smaller one of eighteen guns, he boasted in his elation that he would soon be master of the Indian seas. But a term was about to be put to his insolence and his depredations. On March 22, 1755, Commodore William James, commander of the East India Company's marine force, set sail from Bombay in the _Protector_ of forty-four guns, with the _Swallow_ of sixteen guns, and two bomb vessels. With the assistance of a Maratha fleet he had...", "...miles north-east of the end of this hill. The battle seems to have begun on the plain, and when overcome, Israel fled to the hill, and then Saul and his sons fell. I could not but notice, while looking on the mount from the plain, how it accorded with the statement, that the chariots and horsemen followed hard after Saul on Mount Gilboa. The ascent from the plain is such that horsemen and chariots might pass up even to the top of this hill. The plain of Esdralon may be thirty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> miles by forty. Our course led us to the east of a rough and very rocky hill, that rises in the plain a little south-east of Mount Tabor. As soon as we passed the south-east corner of this hill we entered on a district that was evidently volcanic. The lava was very old, and much disintegrated, so as to make a most excellent soil. This continued all the way to the edge of the lake. We did, indeed, for a short distance, as we passed close by the foot of Mount Tabor, get off,...", "...beds of the friable kind of tuff extend so continuously over an uneven surface, that probably they were formed by the falling of showers of ashes. Within this same crater, strata of coarse tuff, chiefly composed of fragments of lava, abut, like a consolidated talus, against the inside walls. They rise to a height of between one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet above the surface of the internal brine-lake; they dip inwards, and are inclined at an angle varying from thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> degrees. They appear to have been formed beneath water, probably at a period when the sea occupied the hollow of the crater. I was surprised to observe that beds having this great inclination did not, as far as they could be followed, thicken towards their lower extremities. BANKS' COVE. (FIGURE 13.

On this preliminary trip, he penetrated as far as latitude 16 1/2 south, whence, finding the tributaries flowing from fine open plains and level forest country, all well-grassed, he returned to the main camp. On the 4th of January, 1856, Gregory started with a much larger party on an energetic dash into the interior. He had with him six men besides his brother, Dr. von Mueller and Baines the artist, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> horses. He retraced his steps along his preliminary route, and on the 30th of January, thinking it wise judging from the rapid evaporation of the waterholes, to make his means of retreat secure, he formed a temporary camp, leaving there four men and all the horses but eleven to await his return, whilst he, his brother, Dr. Mueller, and a man named Dean, rode ahead to challenge the desert to the south. On the 9th of February, having run the Victoria out, he crossed an almost...", "...into this harbour: and even seventy gun ships, the largest requisite in that country in time of war, if they were built flat-bottomed, like the Dutch ships, might pass every where in that harbour. \"In 1719 Pensacola was taken by Mr. Champmelin, in the Hercules man of war, of sixty-four guns, but carried only fifty-six; in company with the Mars, pierced for sixty guns, but had in only fifty-four; and the Triton, pierced for fifty-four guns, but carried only fifty; with two frigates of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> and twenty guns. [Footnote: The admiral was on board of the Hercules, which drew twenty-one feet of water, and there were but twenty-two feet into the harbour in the highest tides; so that they despaired of carrying in this ship.

Every one on the walls had expected, that a skirmish between the retreating Englishmen and Castilians would now take place before their eyes. But they were greatly mistaken.

A picked animal could be purchased at from eight to twelve dollars, but taken at wholesale, they could be bought for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> dollars a dozen. Some of these were purchased for the army, and answered a most useful purpose. The horses were generally very strong, formed much like the Norman horse, and with very heavy manes and tails.

No less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> of Shakspere's plays contain stage-directions for music, and his marvelous command of song-words is universally recognized. The English stage had made use of songs, in fact, ever since the liturgical drama of the Middle Ages.

Hunger and thirst would ere long destroy them, even though they should escape the arrow and the tomahawk.

It was a sustained action, extending for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours. It held the center of the war stage; on no other part of the fighting fronts were there any measurable activities that produced like successes against German arms. The movement, which aimed to drive the German lines farther back from their Paris objective also had its significance in that its second stage was directed by American commanders and undertaken solely by American troops.

An old sailor sitting near by where I was standing, upon seeing the ceiling broken above my head, said, \"Don't be alarmed; lightning nor shells never strike twice in the same place.\" Another shell went crashing through the ward-room, down through an old family Bible (which Acting Ensign Milton Webster had captured ashore), and...", "...Then the ancient Drandsky Monastery was a fair sight, white-walled and green-roofed against the background of black mountains, the mountains in turn shown off against the snowy ranges of the interior Caucasus. The clouds hung unevenly over the climbing mountains, so that far snow-bestrewn headlands looked like the speckly backs of monsters stalking up into the sky. I walked through miles and miles of brown bracken and rosy withered azalea leaves. There came a day of rain, and I spent <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours in a deserted house, staring most of the time at the continuous drench that poured from the sky. I made myself tea several times from the rainwater that rushed off the roof. I crouched over a log fire, and wondered where the summer had gone. It needed but a day of rain to show how tired all nature was. The leaves that were weighed down with water failed to spring back when the rain had passed. The dry and dusty shrubs did not wash green as they do in the spring.

But the young man remembered it, and one day, thirty-six years later, after a life of hardship and struggle, such as the life of a country minister is apt to be, he wrote and inclosed a money-order, a payment on his debt. That letter and its inclosure brought only sorrow to Mark Twain. He felt that it laid upon him the accumulated burden of the weary <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years' struggle with ill-fortune. He returned the money, of course, and in a biographical note commented: How pale painted heroisms of romance look beside it! Thompson's heroism, which is real, which is colossal, which is sublime, and which is costly beyond all estimate, is achieved in profound obscurity, and its hero walks in rags to the end of his days. I had forgotten Thompson completely, but he flashes before me as vividly as lightning. I can...", "...new kakemono, I saw a picture of a young wife kneeling before an alcove wherein the smoke of the magical incense was shaping the shadow of the absent husband.(1) Although the power of making visible the forms of the dead has been claimed for one sort of incense only, the burning of any kind of incense is supposed to summon viewless spirits in multitude. These come to devour the smoke. They are called Jiki- ko-ki, or \"incense-eating goblins;\" and they belong to the fourteenth of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> classes of Gaki (pretas) recognized by Japanese Buddhism. They are the ghosts of men who anciently, for the sake of gain, made or sold bad incense; and by the evil karma of that action they now find themselves in the state of hunger-suffering spirits, and compelled to seek their only food in the smoke of incense. 1 Among the curious Tokyo inventions of 1898 was a new variety of cigarettes called Hangon-so, or \"Herb of Hangon,\"--a name suggesting that their smoke operated...", "...silk, of which you require four skeins; make a stitch, take one off, knit one, and slip the previous one over this.

That was the beginning of our navy; and it was very necessary we should have one to protect our seaport towns and destroy the English ships sent against us, also to make it more difficult and hazardous for them to bring over new levies of troops to deprive us of our liberties, and from using their vessels to destroy our merchantmen, and so put an end to our commerce. \"Rhode Island had bold and skilful seamen, some of whom had had something to do with British ships...", "...clover field--and the flower garden, too.

He was scooting along through the damp air, flashing his light at the rate of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> times a minute, when a heavy body bumped into him and knocked him head over heels upon the grass-carpeted ground. It was no wonder that he felt upset. And he felt quite peevish, too, as he picked himself up and looked about him to see what had happened. The next moment he was flashing his light into the blinking eyes of an enormous fat person, who seemed to be dazed, either by the shock of the collision or by the light--Freddie Firefly couldn't tell which. \"Why don't...", "...lit the welkin dome, And all thy hues were born in heaven.

He committed a burglary, was caught, condemned to imprisonment by Count de Guttenstein, and released only at the urgent prayers of his relatives, and on payment of a fine. It appears that he hoped to wash away this disgrace with baptismal water; the church was not scrupulous, and received even this despicable wretch, when at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> he presented himself with wife and children, to be received into Christianity (about 1505?). He seems to have been baptized at Cologne; at any rate, he was kept and made much of by the ignorant, proud and fanatical Dominicans of that city. Cologne was an owls' nest of light-shunning swaggerers, who endeavored to obscure the dawn of a bright day with the dark clouds of superstition, hostile to knowledge. At their head was Hochstraten (Hoogstraten), an inquisitor or...", "...there have been 3600 x 365-1/4 days, and the total loss has amounted to an hour; hence the length of \"an instant,\" the loss per diem, can be found from the equation 1/2(3600 x 365)^2 instants = 1 hour; whence one \"instant\" equals the 240 millionth part of a second. This minute quantity represents the retardation of the earth per day. In a year the aggregate loss mounts up to 1/3600th part of a second, in a century to about three seconds, and in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> centuries to an hour. But even at the end of the thirty-six centuries the day is barely any longer; it is only 3600 x 365 instants, that is 1/180th of a second, longer than it was at the beginning. And even a million years ago, unless the rate of loss was different (as it probably was), the day would only be thirty-five minutes shorter, though by that time the aggregate loss, as measured by the apparent lateness of any perfectly punctual...", "...system.

It appeared that the overseer had struck one of the lads with a stick. Mr. C. reproved him severely for the act, and assured him if he did such a thing again he would take him before a magistrate. During the day we gathered the following information:-- Mr. C. had been a planter for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years.

It was composed of forty-nine galleys, but these were supplemented by a great number of sailing ships; the sailing craft, however, did not arrive till September 22nd. These vessels were gradually making way among the Spaniards since the discovery of the new world. At this time the Venetians possessed fourteen nefs. Doria had augmented these by twenty-two of his own, and the total number of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> was commanded by Franco Doria, a nephew of the admiral. The Venetian nefs were commanded by Alessandro Condalmiero, captain of the _Galleon of Venice_. This was the most formidable fighting vessel in the Mediterranean; she was reckoned an excellent sailor, she was by far the most heavily armed sailing ship then afloat; in fact, in the opinion of contemporary seamen, she was \"an invincible fortress.\" Doria, Grimani, and Capello had now nearly 200 ships carrying nearly...", "...glowing orifice on the over-hanging clouds.

The monks met in silence for one daily meal and wore white hoods so as not to see each other.

Her large, starry eyes were of that peculiar gray which changes with every emotion of the soul; at one time seeming to be heavenly-blue, at another the darkest and most flashing...", "...down here in this coffin, and give your sister back to your arms.

He thought that only the slow, heavy rolling of years could have worn those lines about her faded lips, and those dark purplish hollows under the steady, undimmed eyes. That composed, frigid Salome, watching him from across the corpse and coffin, seemed a mere chill shadow of the fiery, impetuous, radiant girl, whose passionate waywardness had so often annoyed and grieved him. The alabaster vase was still perfect...", "...counting the divisions Monnet and Boudet, ten thousand men in all, commanded by Desaix, and now, as we have said, detached from the main army to cut off the retreat of the enemy to Genoa. Only, instead of making that retreat, the enemy were now attacking.

At four o'clock in the morning the firing began and General Victor assigned all to their line of battle. At five Bonaparte was awakened by the sound of cannon. While he was dressing, General Victor's aide-de-camp rode up to tell him that the enemy had crossed the Bormida and was attacking all along the line of battle. The First Consul called for his horse, and, springing upon...", "...of all this was that '48 left no mark on the internal history of the country, and the fever which burned in youthful bosoms was mainly, if not entirely, intellectual and transcendental. The young Catiline from Grimstad, therefore, met with several sympathetic rebels, but found nobody willing to conspire. But what he did find is so important in the consideration of his future development that it is needful briefly to examine it. Norway had, in 1850, been independent of Denmark for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years. During the greater part of that time the fiery excitements of a struggle for politic existence had fairly exhausted her mental resources, and had left her powerless to inaugurate a national literature. Meanwhile, there was no such discontinuity in the literary and scientific relations of the two countries as that which had broken their constitutional union. A tremendous effort was made by certain patriots to discover the basis of an entirely independent intellectual...", "...the map by scarlet lines.

Only in secret was some notice taken of the affair; which had really gone beyond ordinary bounds. Colonel Becker gave Ivan more than one hour of serious consideration; for to him Ivan's father was more than a name. And, in the end, the boy was granted what his mother had hitherto vainly asked: leave to spend <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours, weekly--from Saturday night to Monday morning--at home, in his mother's company. It was a wise decision, and it served a double purpose; for not only did it remove a sure victim from the band of savages that held possession of the school through every weekly holiday, but it gave one miserable boy just enough respite from his wretchedness to stifle the revelations which time and suffering would otherwise have surely brought. Even so, at first, Becker trembled lest the...", "...Navy-yard. Dinner was just over at the villa, the family still chatting over the dessert, children and all in an unusually merry mood, when this mail was brought in by a servant, and handed to Mr. Dinsmore. He promptly distributed it, took up the paper of the earliest date, and glancing over the headings, exclaimed, with a groan, \"It has come!\" \"What?\" queried the others, in excited chorus. \"War! My country! oh, my country! Fort Sumter has fallen after a terrific bombardment of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours.\" And he proceeded to read aloud the account of the engagement, the others listening in almost breathless silence. \"And they have dared to fire upon the flag! the emblem of our nationality, the symbol of Revolutionary glory; to tear it down and trample it in the dust!\" cried Mr. Travilla, pushing back his chair in unwonted excitement; \"shameful, shameful!\" Tears were rolling down Elsie's cheeks, and Rose's eyes were full. \"Let us adjourn to the library and learn...", "...might, loveliness, and grace, of humility and fear of sin.

He is rather a nice-looking fellow, with a mild, open countenance. Kone told him to tell the Paitana natives, who murdered James and Thorngren, that, if they wished peace and friendship, they must come in here and sue for it; that I could not first go to them, as they were the offenders and murderers.

If it was the latter, then it would require a new act of Congress to apply it to any other Territory than Utah and New Mexico.

Nobody had heard the noise of any such conflict. The fact is, that conflict was yet to be aroused. And, lastly, it was most highly surprising and confusing that the attempt to rouse this conflict should proceed from the bosom of the party which had won its splendid victory under the peace issue upon the subject of slavery, and should be inaugurated by a member of that party from the North.

Banks remembered well his visit to Botany Bay with Captain Cook in 1770, and he now urged the dispatch of convicts, hitherto transported to America, to this newly found bay in New South Wales. So in 1787 a fleet of eleven ships with one thousand people on board left the shores of England under the command of Captain Phillip. After a tedious voyage of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> weeks, they reached Botany Bay in January 1788. Captain Phillip had been appointed Governor of all New South Wales, that is from Cape York to Van Diemen's Land, still supposed to be part of the mainland. But Phillip at once recognised that Botany Bay was not a suitable place for a settlement. No white man had described these shores since the days of Captain Cook. The green meadows of which Banks spoke were barren swamps and bleak sands, while the bay itself was exposed to...", "...without towers or projections of any kind; they measure 430 feet in length from north to south, by 255 feet in width.

An extant catalogue of another Cistercian house, that of Meaux in Yorkshire, clearly indicates the whereabouts of the conventual books. Some church books were before the great altar, others were in the choir, a few in the infirmary chapel, and in the common press and other presses of the church. The bulk of them was in the common aumbry, not apparently in the open cloister, but in a room off the cloister. Over the door, on a shelf or in a cupboard, were four Psalters; <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> books were on the top shelf on the other side of the room; the remainder, to the number of about 270, were on other shelves marked by letters of the alphabet.[4] [1] Sandys, i. 266.

Not that theories are wanting; some writers have gone so far as to imagine this monument to have been erected to commemorate periods or reigns, and each block to represent either a _ahau-katun_, \"twenty-four years,\" or a century, _katun_, \"fifty-two years.\" Now, as there are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> pillars having each ten stones, this monument would be, by the first computation, 8,640 years old, and by the second, 18,720. It is clear that were this the case the first stone would have disappeared long before the last one had been placed, and that the earlier would have looked older than the later ones, whereas the same air of decay is observable in all.

On the good sense and virtue of the nation they could confidently rely for acquiescence in a measure which the public exigencies rendered necessary, which tended to equalize the public burdens, and which in its execution would not be oppressive. A motion made by Mr. Jackson, to strike out that section which imposed a duty on domestic distilled spirits, was negatived by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> to sixteen; and the bill was carried by thirty-five to twenty-one.

They are more slender in build than the common pig, and covered with long, stiff bristles, colored with alternate rings of gray, light-brown, and black.

As to the size of Crystal Cave, it is impossible to make any positive statement; for as Mr. McBride, the proprietor, says, no survey has yet been made. Other persons said that <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> miles is the greatest claim made for the combined length of all passages, and sixteen miles the least, so it may be wise to accept the lesser number until a survey proves it wrong.

The great disorder of the manuscript; its mutilated commencement; the gap between <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> years in the middle; the absence of certain records, comprised in certain excerpts from it, quoted by old writers; the discovery that many of these writers quoted from another MS. of the Chronicle belonging to the Gaddi Library; all this justified his statement that the problem could not be finally solved without the aid of the Gaddi Codex, which he had not yet been able to discover. On the other hand, Professor Santini maintained, in a prize essay, that the Gaddi Codex...", "...1916, a number of boats having Americans on board were torpedoed without warning. These boats were the _Eaglejoint_, the _Englishman_, the _Manchester_Engineer_ and the _Sussex_. One American was killed or drowned on the _Englishman_, but the issue finally came to a head over the torpedoing of the channel passenger boat, _Sussex_ which carried passengers between Folkstone and Dieppe, France. On March twenty-fourth the _Sussex_ was torpedoed near the coast of France. Four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> persons, of whom seventy-five were Americans, were on board. The captain and a number of the passengers saw the torpedo and an endeavour was made to avoid it. After the boat was struck the many passengers took to the boats.

Returning winter tells that the year has gone full circle; the sun among the stars gives the definite measure of the days. A ring of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> great boulders, set ten paces apart, would give the measure of the year in days; and of circles like this there are more than one. In this endless ring of days the moon is the measurer, marking the hours and weeks upon the blue belt of night studded with golden stars.

It is a narrow plane made of boxwood, and has generally a steel blade let into it to cut; it is used by taking hold of each end with a hand, and moving it to and fro over the wood to be shaved down. STOCK AND BITS. [Illustration] There are about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> bits to a set, all of different shapes and sizes; but our young friends need not get quite so many: if they provide themselves with a couple of a medium size, this will be sufficient, such as the centre bit and the auger bit. The centre bit will cut holes varying from a quarter of an inch to three quarters of an inch in diameter, and is used by pressing the knob end against the chest, and twirling the centre part round with the hand. It cuts a hole very clean, leaving it...", "...for as the head of Trinity College, Cambridge, and a follower of Newton, he knew some mathematics. Erasmus (1466-1536) lived a little too early to attempt it, although his brilliant satire might have been used to good advantage against those who did try.

This noble production was designed by a master, is every where straight, and executed with labour and judgement. Here he perceives the date of his own conquest, and of his civilization. Thus the Romans humbled a ferocious people. If he chooses to measure it he will find it exactly sixty feet wide, divided into three lands, resembling those in a ploughed field. The centre land <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> feet, and raised from one to three, according to the nature of the ground. The side lands, twelve each, and rising seldom more than one foot. This centre land no doubt was appropriated for the march of the troops, and the small one, on each side, for the out-guards, who preserved their ranks, for fear of a surprize from the vigilant and angry Britons. The Romans held these roads in great esteem, and were severe in their laws for their preservation. This famous road is...", "...of his life, he turned and smiled at his nurse and his wife and daughter and said: \"Give my love to my public.\" So he died, and there were tears in thousands of British homes that night. His death crowded every other topic to the back pages of the newspapers. There were columns of anecdotes and every day brought a fresh flood of tributes from divines, lecturers, novelists, dramatists, publicists of all kinds. One newspaper sent this reply-paid telegram to Old Mole: _Please send <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> words on Wherry._ Having no other use for the printed form, Old Mole filled it in thus: _He sold sugar.--Beenham._ His tribute was not printed. There arose a mighty quarrel as to whether or no Wherry should be buried in Westminster Abbey. The Poets' Corner was crowded. Only an indubitable immortal should have the privilege of resting his bones there. The voices of the nation stormed in argument. Were the works of Wherry literature? Men of acknowledged...", "...empire its actual form and extent.] [Footnote 23: The aera of the Chinese monarchy has been variously fixed from 2952 to 2132 years before Christ; and the year 2637 has been chosen for the lawful epoch, by the authority of the present emperor.

Still, I don't say that it is not an advantage to be strong-handed if we get heavy weather, and it makes light work of getting up sail or shifting it, and one wants to shift pretty often when he is trying to get high speed out of a craft.\" The wind continued fitful, and, in spite of having her racing sails, the Osprey's run to the Start was a long one.

Soon after this we saw the brig Ark coming out of the harbour of Sierra Leone, which returned into port on the 7th, and sailed again on the 14th of the same month. This brig had the Aid-de-camp of the late Sir Neil Campbell on board, who died nearly three weeks before our arrival, and this officer was the...", "...them.\" This not only chilled the hearts of the leaders, but also alarmed their followers, who saw them leaving one large Catholic house after another crestfallen in expression and without a single recruit in their train. To add to their depression, the roads were bad, and in many places deep with mud, and the weather was stormy and very wet.[315] Instead of increasing, as Sir Everard and his friends had hoped and expected, their numbers steadily diminished, and they were soon reduced to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> or less.[316] Their men still further lagged behind and disappeared, and the leaders of the expedition threatened those who remained that the next man who attempted to desert should be instantly shot. When they rested, Sir Everard and his companions took it in turn to watch their men with a loaded pistol, determined to make an example of the first deserter they could get a shot at. When they rode on, they endeavoured to be equally vigilant; but with such a straggling,...", "...if possible, to have as many states as the North, and it was with this purpose that it fought so hard to have slavery introduced into Missouri. [=The Missouri Compromise=] The famous \"Missouri Compromise,\" by which the ominous dispute of 1820 was at last settled, included the admission of one free state (Maine) and one slave state (Missouri) at the same time, and it was enacted that no other slave state should be formed out of any part of the Louisiana territory north of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> degrees thirty minutes, which was the southern boundary line of Missouri. The assent of opposing parties to this arrangement was secured largely by the patriotic efforts of Clay, who, says Schurz, \"did not confine himself to speeches, * * * but went from man to man, expostulating, beseeching, persuading, in his most winning way. * * * His success added greatly to his reputation and gave new strength to his influence.\" The result, says John Quincy Adams, was \"to bring into...", "...in an ascent at Bordeaux. Only one aspirant contested the place of public aeronaut--one Goulston, who had been Gale's patron. Before many months, however, he too met with a balloonist's death, being dashed against some stone walls when ascending near Manchester. It will not be difficult to form an estimate of how entirely the popularity of the balloon was now reestablished in England, from the mere fact that before the expiration of the year Coxwell had been called upon to make <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> voyages. Some of these were from Glasgow, and here a certain coincidence took place which is too curious to be omitted. A descent effected near Milngavie took place in the same field in which Sadler, twenty-nine years before, had also descended, and the same man who caught the rope of Mr. Sadler's balloon performed the same service once again for a fresh visitor from the skies. The following autumn Coxwell, in fulfilling one out of many engagements, found himself in a...", "...folly of her plan. After his arguments were exhausted he raised his voice louder. As usual, when excited by anger, he swung his lower right arm to and fro, feeling the prominent muscles with his left hand. But Kuni remained resolute, and when be at last perceived that his opposition only increased her obstinacy, he exclaimed: \"Then rush on to your destruction! The day will come when you will see where you belong. If only it doesn't arrive too late. A man grows twelve and a woman <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> months older every year.\" With these words he turned his back upon her, and the clown brought the amount of wages which was due. Many an eye grew dim with tears when Kuni bade farewell to her companions. Shortly after sunset she was welcomed to Frau Schurstab's house. The first greeting was friendly, and she received nothing but kindness and indulgent treatment afterward. She had a sunny chamber of her own, and how large and soft her bed was! But while, when on the...", "...dim stars. Dust, perspiration, illumination, conversation--these were the regular elements. \"They're very civilised,\" a friend who knows them as well as they can be known had said to me of the people in general; \"plenty of fireworks and plenty of talk-- that's all they ever want.\" That they were \"civilised\"--on the side on which they were most to show--was therefore to be the word of the whole business, and nothing could have, in fact, had more interest than the meaning that for the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-six</span> hours I read into it. Seen from below and diminished by distance, Anacapri makes scarce a sign, and the road that leads to it is not traceable over the rock; but it sits at its ease on its high, wide table, of which it covers--and with picturesque southern culture as well--as much as it finds convenient.
