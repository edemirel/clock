As these trees are most abundant along the margins of streams, the fruit often drops into the water and is carried down stream to some sand drift or into the mud, where more sand is likely to cover them.

Now these very heavily charged tubes give a radiation so intense at points close to the tube, due to the greater density of the rays near the tube, and, also, to the action of the softer and more easily absorbable rays, that it has been found necessary to stop these softer rays--both the y and ss--by wrapping lead or platinum round the tube. In this lead or platinum some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> per cent. or more of the rays is absorbed and, of course, wasted. But in the absence of the screen there is extensive necrosis of the tissues near the tubes.

The translation had been executed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years ago by a young German friend of the great Pundit. I had to touch up every sentence. This I did without at all impairing faithfulness to the original. My first 'copy' was set up in type and a dozen sheets were struck off.

He published nothing till he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years of age, though he wrote poetry from early youth. His study was in the open air, under some grand old oaks on the edge of a deep ravine. In his hands French poetry became for the first time musical and descriptive of nature.

To sum up: On the whole Carpathian front, between March 19 and April 12, the enemy, having suffered enormous losses, left in our hands, in prisoners only, at least 70,000 men, including about 900 officers. Further, we captured more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> guns and 200 machine guns. On April 16 the actions in the Carpathians were concentrated in the direction of Rostoki.

Another plan, discussed over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years ago, has during the past decade come to assume practical importance as a method of co-operation on business lines.

Each boat carried from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> to forty boatmen, and a number of such boats frequently traveled in company.

As this was the auspicious year, he ordered the relic to be brought in state to the capital and lodged in the Imperial Palace, after which it was to make the round of the monasteries in the city.

The reply is intimated by the place where the great bell was found, and by the events intervening between 1680 and 1692, when Diego de Vargas recaptured Santa Fe. It will be remembered that the bell was left on the slope of the high mesa towards the S.W., in the rocky and desolate gorge descending towards the pueblo San Cristobal, the old home of the Tanos tribe.[166] Father Jose Amanda Niel writes, about twenty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years after the rebellion, that the Tanos secured the greatest part of the booty, among which were bells (_campanas_).[167] That this bell was not carried to the high _mesa_ by the Pecos I believe I have proved; its proximity to the Tanos village, and its actual position in the _canada_ leading towards the latter, shows that it was either to be carried down to it or carried up from it. If it is (as current report has it) the bell of Pecos, then it was a trophy which the Tanos...", "...flock committed to her.

We shall have <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> thousand freemen to join us from the country.'\" The statement of the deposition is crude and overdone, yet there can be no doubt that from this time Adams did work for the one great end. At first he was alone, yet he recognized the temper of the continent, and saw the way that the political sentiments of the country were tending. The methods which he followed were not always open; for never did he avow his true sentiments, while often protesting, on behalf of the town or the...", "...THE INN I It was a plain brick house, three full stories, with four broad chimneys, and overhanging eaves. The tradition was that it had been a colonial tavern--a dot among the fir-covered northern hills on the climbing post-road into Canada. The village scattered along the road below the inn was called Albany--and soon forgotten when the railroad sought an opening through a valley less rugged, eight miles to the west. Rather more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years ago the Doctor had arrived, one summer day, and opened all the doors and windows of the neglected old house, which he had bought from scattered heirs. He was a quiet man, the Doctor, in middle life then or nearly so; and he sank almost without remark into the world of Albany, where they raise hay and potatoes and still cut good white pine off the hills. Gradually the old brick tavern resumed the functions of life: many buildings were added to it as well as many acres of...", "...upon the mule loads [p.188]of mulberry leaves, eight or ten trees, in common years, yielding one load; and as the income of the proprietors depends entirely upon the growth of these leaves, they suffer less from a bad crop, because their taxes are proportionally low.

The village Sheikh fixes the contributions to be paid by each village, taking care to appropriate a part of them to himself. Last year many peasants were obliged to sell a part of their furniture, to defray the taxes; it may easily be conceived therefore in what misery they live: they eat scarcely any thing but the worst bread, and oil, or soups made of the wild herbs, of which tyranny cannot deprive them.

Starting with one hundred and fifteen cases in 1768, Jefferson was retained as attorney or counsel in no less than four hundred <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> cases in 1771, and it is no exaggeration to state that no day passed during the twelve years he remained engaged in the practice of law without his giving considerable time to his profession.

The 'Regent,' which was the first steamboat that plied between London and Margate, was fitted with engines by Maudslay in 1816; and it proved the forerunner of a vast number of marine engines, the manufacture of which soon became one of the most important branches of mechanical engineering.

He had only one son living--Robert; two other children had died in infancy. Robert Carr, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years of age now, was not renowned for his steadiness of conduct; indeed, he had been a sad spendthrift, and innumerable unpleasant scenes had resulted therefrom between him and his father. It could not be said that his heart was bad; but his head was certainly light.

Four days later the new breach had attained a width of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> yards, but Clive had prepared defences in the rear, similar to those at the other breach; and the difficulties of the besiegers would here be much greater, as the ditch was not fordable.

The PCR membership campaign had been given particular emphasis in the major industries, such as the metal, machine-building, coal, petroleum, and chemical industries, where 27 to 36 percent of the workers were reported to belong to the party.

The Broad Street institution has accommodation for about fifty children in addition to a separate building containing <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> beds for the reception of fever cases, the erection of which cost L7,800; and there is a Convalescent Home at Alvechurch in connection with this Hospital to which children are sent direct from the wards of the Hospital (frequently after surgical operations) thus obtaining for them a more perfect convalescence than is possible when they are returned to their own homes, where in too many instances those important aids to recovery --pure air, cleanliness, and good food are sadly...", "...check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.

Ned watched him excitedly, and as he recalled his own adventure, he was in dread lest the reptile should make a rush at the gaily-clad figure, so occupied in his task that he would have been quite at the monster's mercy. Similar thoughts evidently troubled the Malays, for five of the men took their spears from where they leaned, and stood some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet behind the lad, ready to rush forward to his help. But there was no need. Frank worked quickly and well, driving the peg down into the ground with the club, sufficiently tightly to keep the hen from getting free, but not hard enough to prevent its being drawn by the reptile, supposing that the twine did not break.

Rather a good story, isn't it?\" The story was completely thrown away on Emily; but one subject interested her now. \"My poor aunt has always been fond of me,\" she said. \"Perhaps she might know me, when she recognizes nobody else.\" \"Not very likely,\" the doctor answered. \"But there's no laying down any rule in cases of this kind.

Nothing is known of their voyage till they came to Leif's booths in Vinland. They laid up their ship, caught fish for their support, and spent a pleasant winter.

Brown prepared a memorandum showing that the British North American provinces, from 1820 to 1854, had bought one hundred and sixty-seven million dollars worth of goods from the United States, and the United States only sixty-seven million dollars worth from the provinces; that in the thirteen years of the treaty, the trade between the two countries was six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> million dollars according to the Canadian returns, and six hundred and seventy million dollars according to the American returns; and that the so-called \"balance of trade\" in this period was considerably against Canada.

So late as the year 1700, eighty years after the landing of the Pilgrims, there were, in all the New England States then settled, but one Episcopal church, no Methodist church, and, with the exception of Rhode Island, not more than half a dozen Baptist churches. At that time, however, there were one hundred and twenty Congregational churches, composed of emigrants from Europe and their descendants, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> others composed of converted Indians. The great mass of the descendants of the early settlers of New England are Congregationalists, maintaining, substantially, the same views of church order and religious faith which their venerated ancestry sacrificed home, and country, and life, to maintain and perpetuate.

In the middle section of the table there were a number of diminutive sand heaps, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> in all, and on each one was a small wooden cross and on each cross was a name.

This novel enjoyed an extraordinary success, and had more of the graphic and sprightly manner by which Valdes has since been distinguished, than the books which immediately followed it.

From the allurements held out to the Boys to give themselves up, they went, at one time, nearly to Hillsboro to beg the pardon of the Governor, (Tryon), but finding out it was his intention, if he could get them into his hands, to have hanged every one of them, they returned, and kept themselves concealed until patriotic sentiment grew so rapidly from that time (1771) to the Mecklenburg Declaration,...", "...my being sold.

Before the Blackfeet obtained horses in the very first years of the present century, and when their only beasts of burden were dogs, their possessions were transported by these animals or on men's backs. We may imagine that in those days the journeys made were short ones, the camp travelling but a few miles.

These were sometimes very large, often consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> cow-skins, and, when set up, containing two or three fires like this [Illustration:] or in ground plan like this [Illustration:]. The skins of these large lodges were sewn together in strips, of which there would be sometimes as many as four; and, when the lodge was set up, these strips were pinned together as the front of a common lodge is pinned to-day. The dogs carried the provisions, tools, and utensils, sometimes the lodge strips, if these were small enough, or anything...", "...had been and where a ditch had divided off the marsh, a fortress of snow lay now: a seemingly impregnable bulwark, six or seven feet high, with rounded top, fitting descriptions which I had read of the underground bomb-proofs around Belgian strongholds--those forts which were hammered to pieces by the Germans in their first, heart-breaking forward surge in 1914.

About half of them were reading by themselves, individuals, each by himself or herself,--mostly herself, for at least three-fourths of the members were women, and their average age was about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years. The other half were united in groups, \"local circles,\" as they were called. Some of these were community circles, people of one village or town, irrespective of church relations; other circles were connected with the churches. In those days before the Christian Endeavor Society, the Epworth League, and other nation-wide organizations had appropriated the interest of the young people, the Chautauqua Circle was the literary society in many churches.

These are real names; Caio is a parish in Carmarthenshire, and my clerical friend had formerly been Vicar there, though subsequent to Harries' death, which occurred some years ago.

Harries is described as a fine-looking man with a long beard and remarkably bushy eyebrows. He would occasionally tramp the country, carrying an enormous volume of astrological lore under his arm, leather-bound, with a strong lock attached. This, he said, was to prevent ignorant people reading the charms contained in the book, and thereby raising evil spirits.

The white birches there were from a foot up to twenty-two inches in diameter, having long, straight trunks, clear of limbs from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> to forty feet in length. These clear trunks only were used for bolts. Plying their axes, Halstead, Addison, Thomas and Willis felled upward of forty trees that night, and these were all sawn by dark. On an average, five trees were required for a cord of bolts; but with sharp axes such white-birch trees can be felled fast.

His anger being kindled, he went up to his father's house, instead of returning to his wife.[64:1] But it came to pass, that, after a while, Samson repented of his actions, and returned to his wife's house, and wished to go in to his wife in the chamber; but her father would not suffer him to go.

Of course this kind of attitude is never logical: for a long time we closed Covent Garden to Strauss's _Salome_ for the same reason, but no one, so far as I know, ever proposed to endow it with a religious halo. Now, when Sunday secular music is everywhere, its origins seem lost in antiquity; but the chamber-music concerts at South Place in London and Balliol College in Oxford, which are, I think I am right in saying, the twin pioneers, are both little over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years old. In most other countries, however, music has suffered far fewer checks of this kind; and it is of more importance to correlate musical and religious development on more general lines. Particularly interesting, I think, is the history of the decline of the oratorio, which I should myself be inclined to date from the production of the German Requiem of Brahms about half a century ago, though the real impetus has become apparent only during the last generation....", "...the bare, white hillside toward the Troup farm, and then he trudged across the orchard in the opposite direction. Looking from the fence past the end of the barn, he could vaguely make out against the sky-line the rounded and wooded little hill on top of which Barnabas was to mount guard. It was very nearly a quarter of a mile distant. Coming back to his former post, he riveted his eyes on the house. It faced toward the barn, and the side wall was directly opposite him, separated by a <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> foot strip of yard. He half expected to see one of the shutters thrown open, or to hear the sound of voices from within. But, as the minutes slipped by, and only the moaning of the wind broke the silence of the night, the lad grew ashamed of his fears. The bitter cold was the only enemy he had to contend with. His bare ears and hands pained him terribly, and a slight sensation of drowsiness warned him that he must keep moving.

There were two groups of economic communistic experiments, similar in their general characteristics but differing in their origin. One took its inspiration directly from Robert Owen, the distinguished philanthropist and successful cotton manufacturer of Scotland; the other from Fourier, the noted French social philosopher. In 1825 Robert Owen purchased New Harmony, Rapp's village in Indiana and its <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> thousand appurtenant acres. When Owen came to America he was already famous. Great throngs flocked to hear this practical man utter the most visionary sentiments.

A magnificent frigate, carrying thirty-six pounders, a cutter, and a brig, detached themselves from the English fleet, in order to intercept the route of the Dutch flotilla; but they were received in a manner which took away all desire to return.

The Colossus, although in a sitting posture, measures fifty-two feet in height, and the throne on which it rests is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet long and eighteen broad. These dimensions were sufficient to admit of any internal machinery that might be required to produce the mysterious sounds.

Another solution, as we saw (p. 105), is found in Hamlet's character. He is a philosopher who lingers on at the University from love of his studies there.

The trip between the Selkirk settlements and St. Paul occupies from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> to forty days, and passes through the battle ground of the Siouxs and Chippewas. Several times we came on small parties of the Siouxs, but had no more than short skirmishes with them, our numbers being too formidable for them to attack us. About two days journey from the Selkirk settlements we came to the settlement of Oshawkapee, inhabited by French and half breeds. From this point we passed over a magnificent rolling country interspersed with occasional woods and watered by...", "...end nearest to the entrance is the domestic chapel, extending in a direction east and west; it is approached by a separate entrance, and is of small dimensions compared with the other parts of the building, suggesting the idea that in former times the good people of Moreton, while taking up a very considerable amount of space for the transaction of their temporal concerns, were able to manage their spiritual affairs within extremely moderate limits. The entire length of the structure is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet, but the chapel proper is not more than twelve feet by nine feet. The old sanctuary is now in a sadly dilapidated condition, and damp and dreary enough to remind one of Longfellow's lines-- What a darksome and dismal place! I wonder that any man has the face To call such a hole the House of the Lord. The pavement is broken and dislocated, the walls are stained with damp and mildew, and altogether it exhibits signs of indifference and unseemly disrespect enough...", "...libel, showed a willingness to try the issue, but Havermeyer's sudden death from apoplexy on the morning of the trial (November 30), leaving his proofs unpublished, strengthened Kelly's claim that \"Tammany is the only reform party in existence here to-day.\"[1462] [Footnote 1459: Until then Croker had been an attache of Connolly's office.] [Footnote 1460: \"No law authorised Kelly to include convictions in the Police Courts, yet he did include them, thereby robbing the city of over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> thousand dollars. He charged, at one time, double the rates for conveying prisoners to and from the Island; at another, 133 per cent. more. He charged for 11,000 vagrants committed to the work-house, a clear fraud upon the treasury.\"--New York _Times_, October 20, 1875.] [Footnote 1461: New York papers of September 18, 1874.] [Footnote 1462: New York _World_, September 10, 1874.] The Republican press, apparently with effect, enlarged upon the general excellence of Dix's...", "...07:010:001 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim. 07:010:002 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. 07:010:003 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years. 07:010:004 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 07:010:005 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon. 07:010:006 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not...", "...fair, and rather angular, with hard blue eyes, an aquiline nose, a heavy yellow mustache concealing his mouth, and a ruddy complexion. He was extremely well dressed, and, though one might detect some awkwardness in his movements, his manner had that composure which comes from a great knowledge of the world, and from a natural self-possession and independence of character. His brother, though older by a year, might have passed for being several years younger. He was in reality two and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years of age, but his clear complexion was that of a boy, his dark brown hair curled closely on his head, and his soft brown eyes had a young and trustful look in them, which contrasted strangely with his brother's hard and dominating expression. He was shorter, too, and more slender, but also more graceful; his hands and feet were small and well shaped. Nevertheless, his manner was at least as self-possessed as that of his tall brother, and there was something in his look which...", "...official. Caldwell-Sahib did not hear the lady's reply, as she and the young Hindu girl passed on. \"Oh, is that he? I had forgotten about him. I had such a good laugh afterwards at the surprised expression on his face when he saw me in his house the morning he regained consciousness that I ought to have remembered him. We must turn here, my dear, for I must get back to my work at once.\" So the two turned down a side street which led to the doctor's office where at least <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> dirty, but well-remembered and beloved native patients were waiting for the tender treatments daily administered by the missionary's skillful hands. The Englishman still stared. X The Cost Yes, that is a Bible. Oh, yes, I speak English. I've spoken it ever since I was a young girl. Nearly every Parsi, you know, learns to speak English as soon as possible. We admire English people in a great many ways and try to emulate them in some things, although we are...", "...of the inner need of the soul,--when to remain in the old position becomes as morally impossible as it is physically impossible not to cough when one cannot breathe.... And I am near to that position, and every day I get nearer and nearer to it.\" But Leo Nikolaevitch still did not go away, and remaining continued to be subjected on an increased scale to the tortures to which he had been subjected since the 'eighties. And he remained still for the same reasons as had restrained him for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years. He knew that he would not alleviate the position of the peasants of the district by going. From his painful position in the eyes of men he drew a profitable lesson in humility. His wife's attitude to him assisted in him the development of true love for those who hated his soul. And therefore the more intense these trials became with the passage of time, the more painfully they were reflected in his soul, the more difficult it became for him to deal with them--the more...", "...where the wood was carefully stored, far beyond the reach of a probable invasion by the Pittsburghers. About this time a new enterprise opened for the commander and crew of the \"Gray Eagle.\" The city commenced to pave the streets with large round stones called \"Pavers,\" many of which were found in pockets at the bottom of the river. One day a contractor met Paul on the bank and said: \"Say, son, could not you boys gather a lot of pavers? I will buy them from you and give you <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> cents per hundred.\" The offer was eagerly accepted. Next day the \"Eagle\" was anchored with a piece of rail-road iron, over a pocket, and the crew engaged in diving through the transparent water to the bottom, where they would gather one or two pavers, return to the top, and drop them into the boat. Paul had much difficulty in teaching his companions to keep their eyes open while under water. This occupation was pursued with varying success during the summer months of...", "...carried away. Parts of them were found, on the following morning, on Barnes Common, at the distance of a mile, while other parts were scattered around the fields. He related also, that two horses which were feeding in a shed, were driven, with their manger, into the ditch on the opposite side of the lane; and that a loaded cart was torn from the shafts and wheels, and wafted into an adjoining field. A crop of turnips were mowed down as with a scythe, and a double row of twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> full-grown elms, which stood on the sides of the lane, were torn up by the roots. One man was killed in the barn, and six others were wounded, or so severely shocked as to require relief in an hospital. Having never before met with a case of such total destruction from the action of electricity, I considered these facts as too interesting to be lost. It may be worth while to add, in elucidation, that the mischief was doubtless occasioned by an ascending ball; or rather, as...", "...war-whoops. They filled the front garden, trampling on all the rose beds, cheering William as he swarmed up to the balcony, his trumpet between his lips. The enemy appeared at the window and shut it with a bang, and William, startled, dropped down among his followers. They raised a hoarse roar of anger. [Illustration: THEY TROOPED IN AT THE GARDEN GATE. COOK, PALE AND SPEECHLESS, WATCHED THEM.] \"Mean ole cat!\" shouted the enraged general. The blood of the army was up. No army of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> strong worthy of its name could ever consent to be worsted by an enemy of one. All the doors and windows were bolted. There was only one thing to be done. And this the general did, encouraged by loyal cheers from his army. \"Go it, ole William! Yah! He--oo--o!\" The stone with which William broke the drawing-room window fell upon a small occasional table, scattering Mrs. Brown's cherished silver far and wide. William, with the born general's contempt for the minor...", "...a knife. The two men listened to the clear metallic sound borne upon the clear atmosphere by the winter wind. \"He's a good messenger,\" said Broussard, \"he is making straight for the post.\" \"If he gets there before he breaks his neck,\" replied the Colonel coolly, taking out his cigar case and striking a light. Broussard listened attentively until the last echo had died away in the distance. \"He has got down all right and is now on the open road, and will get to the fort in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> minutes,\" he said. Then Broussard, gathering the broken branches of the fir tree, made a fire which not only warmed them, but the blue smoke curling upward was a signal for those who would come to search for them. He took the saddle and blanket from the dead horse and arranged a comfortable seat for the Colonel, who declared that a broken ankle was nothing; but his face was growing pale as he spoke. \"You remember,\" he said to Broussard, \"that story about General Moreau,...", "...kindled only by subjects of polite literature. The particulars form a curious picture of the taste of the age. \"There is,\" says Joseph Scaliger, that great critic and reviler, \"an art of abuse or slandering, of which those that are ignorant may be said to defame others much less than they show a willingness to defame.\" \"Literary wars,\" says Bayle, \"are sometimes as lasting as they are terrible.\" A disputation between two great scholars was so interminably violent, that it lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years! He humorously compares its duration to the German war which lasted as long. Baillet, when he refuted the sentiments of a certain author always did it without naming him; but when he found any observation which, he deemed commendable, he quoted his name. Bayle observes, that \"this is an excess of politeness, prejudicial to that freedom which should ever exist in the republic of letters; that it should be allowed always to name those whom we refute; and that it is...", "...That it was alive she was not long in finding out. She had reeled in twenty feet of line when, of a sudden, the reel handle was jerked from her fingers. Her knuckles were barked until they bled as she tried in vain to recover that handle. Only the strength of her line saved the day, the line and Katie, for the stout young Finn began backing the boat away. \"I--I've still got him,\" Florence panted as she took a fresh grip on her reel. Once more she began reeling in. Ten, twenty, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet, the fish came grudgingly. Then, with a suddenness that was startling, the pull on the line redoubled. \"He's turned on you. Hold--hold on hard!\" Katie screamed. This time Florence's fingers did not slip. With grim determination she held on. This was a truly big one. She must have him. Was he the catch of the season? What joy if only he were.

They issued from the fog and were engulfed again in its clinging folds--twenty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> men and lads in all. Some carried coils of rope, others oars and boat-hooks. Several of them hauled empty sledges at their heels. The back of the last man vanished in the fog; but Mr. Darling remained in the shelter of the rock until the faintest whisper of their voices had died away before moving hand or foot. \"Organized wreckers,\" he muttered. \"And that big pirate with the lantern was the skipper--the brute who is keeping Flora in this place! By God--I wonder just how much...", "...Bot Fly.] The Bot fly of the horse, (Gastrophilus equi, Fig. 80 and larva), is pale yellowish, spotted with red, with short, grayish, yellow hairs, and the wings are banded with reddish. She lays her eggs upon the knees of the horse. They are conveyed into the stomach, where the larva lives from May until October, and when full grown are found hanging by their mouth hooks on the edge of the rectum of the horse, whence they are carried out in the excrement. The pupa state lasts for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> or forty days, and the perfect fly appears the next season, from June until October. The Bot fly of the ox (Hypoderma bovis, Fig. 81, and larva), is black and densely hairy, and the thorax is banded with yellow and white. The larva is found during the month of May, and also in summer, living in tumors on the backs of cattle. When fully grown, which is generally in July, they make their way out and fall to the ground, and live in the pupa-case from twenty-six to thirty days,...", "...ago: No question is ever settled Until it is settled right. The legitimate successor to James Whitcomb Riley is Edmund Vance Cooke (born 1866). He has the same philosophy of cheerful kindliness, founded on a shrewd knowledge of human nature. Verse is his mother tongue; and occasionally he rises above fluency and ingenuity into the pure air of imagination. Among America's living veterans should be named with respect Edith M. Thomas, who has been bravely singing for over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years. She was born in Ohio on the twelfth of August, 1854 and her first book of poems appeared in 1885. She is an excellent illustration of just how far talent can go unaccompanied by the divine breath of inspiration. She has perhaps almost too much facility; she has dignity, good taste, an excellent command of a wide variety of metrical effects; she has read ancient and modern authors, she is a keen observer, she is as alert and inquisitive now, as in the days of her youth;...", "...check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.

But, nevertheless, there are two defects in it. The first is that it may not be a remedy at all; it may be only a punishment. A Minister may risk his dismissal; he may do some act difficult to undo, and then all which may be left will be to remove and censure him. And the second is that it is only one House of Parliament which has much to say to this remedy, such as it is; the House of Commons only can remove a Minister by a vote of censure. Most of the Ministries for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years have never possessed the confidence of the Lords, and in such cases a vote of censure by the Lords could therefore have but little weight; it would be simply the particular expression of a general political disapproval.

But at this time 100,000 houses within its walls lay in ruins. The ambassadors and their retinue were conducted on foot along a causeway 700 feet long, to the palace gate, where there stood five elephants on either side. On passing this outward gate, they entered a very beautiful paved court of great extent, where they found 100,000 men waiting at the emperors gate, although it was not yet day. Facing this court there was a great _kiosk_ or pavilion, the basis of which was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> cubits high, on which stood pillars fifty cubits high, supporting a gallery sixty cubits long and forty cubits wide. This pavilion had three gates, the middle one being reserved for the emperor, and that on each side was smaller. Above this kiosk, and over the right and left gates, was a _kurkeh_, or great drum; and a bell hung over the middle gate, attended by two persons, to give notice of the appearance of the emperor on his throne. They reckoned that near 300,000 persons...", "...him dead. Thus was escape effected. With the exception of one Englishman and five or six friendly Indians, all the rest were cut down. The wounded were reserved for the horrible doom of torture. The Indians were exceedingly elated by this signal victory, and their shouts of exultation were loud and long-repeated. The next morning, with yells of triumph, they crossed the river, made a rush upon Seekonk, and burned seventy buildings. The next day they stormed Providence, and burned <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> houses. These devastations, however, were not accompanied with much bloodshed, as most of the inhabitants of Providence and of Seekonk had previously fled to the island of Rhode Island for protection. The heroic Roger Williams, however, remained in Providence. He had ever been the firm friend of the Indians, and was well acquainted with the leading chiefs in this war-party. The Indians, while setting fire to the rest of the town, left his person and property unharmed. Flushed...", "...as to produce pain, he dreamed that he had fallen into the hands of a party of North American Indians, who were scalping him. These were dreams suggested by sensations which, were conveyed from the surface of the body, through the nerves, until corresponding impression was produced on the mind. Upon the same principle, very strong impressions received during the day may modify and very materially influence the character of our dreams at night. Dr. Beattie states that once, after riding <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> miles in a very high wind, he passed a night of dreams which were so terrible, that he found it expedient to keep himself awake, that he might no longer be tormented with them. \"Had I been superstitious,\" he observes, \"I should have thought that some disaster was impending; but it occurred to me that the tempestuous weather I had encountered the preceding day might be the cause of all these horrors.\" Other and less obvious causes are in constant operation.

Eighty-two were under twenty years of age, 221 between twenty and thirty. Over half the men killed were earning less than fifteen dollars a week, a fact which raises the question if the law is fair in assuming, as it does in Pennsylvania, that wages cover risk. Fifty-one per cent of the men killed were married with families to support; an additional <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> per cent were single men, partly, or wholly, supporting a family. It was shown that the greatest losses were not due to the spectacular accidents, but to everyday causes. In the steel industry, for instance, forty-two deaths were due to the operation of electric cranes, thirty-one to the operation of broad and narrow gauge railroads in the mills and yards, and twenty-four to falls from a height or into pits, vats, etc. Pittsburgh has stamped out smallpox; its physicians are...", "...I remained working in the north of England, discouraged, as to literature, by the failure of the book of verse, and without much encouragement for painting either; so the summer of 1856 was not very fruitful in work of any kind. Towards autumn, however, I took courage again, and determined to paint from nature on the moors. This led to the first attempt at encamping. It is wonderful what an influence the things we do in early life may have on our future occupations. In 1886, exactly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years later, I made the Saone expedition, for which two _absolutely essential_ qualifications were an intimate knowledge of the French language and a practical acquaintance with encamping. The Roman who said that fifteen years made a long space in human life would have appreciated the importance of thirty, yet across all that space of time what I did in 1856 told just as effectually as if it had been done the year before. _Moral_ (for any young man who may read this book): it is...", "...Romans driven back across the river.--The Romans destroy the bridge over the Ticinus. When Hannibal's army found themselves on the plains of Italy, and sat down quietly to repose, they felt the effects of their fatigues and exposures far more sensibly than they had done under the excitement which they naturally felt while actually upon the mountains. They were, in fact, in a miserable condition. Hannibal told a Roman officer whom he afterward took prisoner that more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> thousand perished on the way in crossing the mountains; some in the battles which were fought in the passes, and a greater number still, probably, from exposure to fatigue and cold, and from falls among the rocks and glaciers, and diseases produced by destitution and misery.

The British, meanwhile, defending the Mons position, were in grave danger of being cut off, enveloped, and destroyed. Sir John French had put his two army corps into battle array. He had about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> miles of front to defend, with Mons nearly in the center. On Sunday afternoon, August 23, 1914, the full weight of the German onset fell for the first time upon the British. All that night the British were under the fire of German artillery.

The two besieged men were not long left in uncertainty as to the change in the Matabili's proceedings, for from the bush below there came the loud report of a gun, followed by a second, and then half a dozen at a time. The threatening yells of the Matabili were changed into shrieks of agony, as they felt the deadly effects of the double-barrelled guns of nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> experienced hunters.

My friend left with me a specimen of translation which he had received from Professor Max Muller. This I began to study, carefully comparing it sentence by sentence with the original. About its literal character there could be no doubt, but it had no flow and, therefore, could not be perused with pleasure by the general reader. The translation had been executed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years ago by a young German friend of the great Pundit. I had to touch up every sentence. This I did without at all impairing faithfulness to the original. My first 'copy' was set up in type and a dozen sheets were struck off. These were submitted to the judgment of a number of eminent writers, European and native. All of them, I was glad to see, approved of the specimen, and then the task of translating the Mahabharata into English seriously began.

These few remarks are called a soliloquy, being addressed rather to the world in general than to any particular person on the stage. Now the object of this soliloquy is plain. The dramatist wished us to know the thoughts which were passing through _Hamlet's_ mind, and it was the only way he could think of in which to do it.

Among the most famous were the _Reindeer_, _Avon_ and _Blakeley_, built in a few weeks, near Boston, in 1814. They were so large and well equipped that more than once they attacked and defeated British warships. Some of the privateers which left Charleston, Bristol and Plymouth were nothing but pilot boats, carrying twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> men each, who gave their attention to the West Indies. They were often obliged to deplete their crews to that extent in order to man their prizes that barely enough were left to manage their own ships. In those days all, of course, were sailing vessels, and they carried nothing in the shape of armor. Their guns were cannon, loading at the muzzle and firing solid shot. The most effective of these was the \"Long Tom,\" which was generally mounted on a pivot forward, and used in...", "...by the skill of all his captains, saved his battleships from losing at least a third of their number.

The story, however, is without foundation, not being mentioned by any contemporary writers, but first appearing in various legends, towards the year 1200. But St. Cunigund is by no means the first German empress of whom the story under consideration is told. A writer contemporary with her, who has nothing to say about the miracle just recounted, relates something very similar of _another_ empress, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years earlier, namely, of Richardis, wife of Charles III. The tale runs that this Charles, in the year 887, accused his queen of unlawful connection with a Bishop. Her Majesty offered to subject herself to the Judgment of God, either by duel or by the ordeal of burning ploughshares. It is not said that either test was applied, but only that the queen retired into a cloister which she had herself founded. This is the contemporary account. A century and a half later we are told...", "...this before they descended the stairs.

He divided the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> converts among them into three circles, and met each of them twice a week: this furnished him a season of refreshment every day, and each of them took part at least once a week. They were thus early initiated into a course of Christian activity, and taught that they would lose much themselves, besides failing to do good to others, if they held back. The converts were so rooted and grounded in this truth, that once, when Miss Fiske was in Geog Tapa, a brother said to her that she...", "...Tuesday and Wednesday and at the sitting on Friday.

In thirty-six hours, he would be at Hixon. There were many things which his brain must attack and digest in these hours. He must arrange his plan of action to its minutest detail, because he would have as little time for reflection, once he had reached his own country, as a wildcat flung into a pack of hounds. From the railroad station to his home, he must make his way--most probably fight his way--through <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> miles of hostile territory where all the trails were watched. And yet, for the time, all that seemed too remotely unreal to hold his thoughts. He was seeing the coolly waving curtains of flowered chintz that stirred in the windows of his room at the Lescott house and the crimson ramblers that nodded against the sky.

I must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn, and was the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction. He even avoided the subject, which I one day thought it my duty to press upon him.

Their cavalry led the advance, but the two guns Vere had placed on West Hill plied them so hotly with shot that they fell back in confusion. It was now high tide, and there were but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> yards between the sea and the sand-hills. The Spaniards therefore marched their infantry into the dunes, while the cavalry prepared to advance between the sand-hills and the cultivated fields inland.

She had meant to wear it proudly on her finger during her stay at the Grange; but, in the excitement of passing events, had forgotten to do so up to the present time. The ring was of value; no one had seen it on her finger, therefore no one would miss it. It occurred to Annie that she might ask a jeweller to lend her <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> shillings on the ring. With this thirty shillings she could buy the stuff for Nora's frocks; and as her father always sent her a pound on her birthday, and that birthday was only a little over a month away, she thought that she might manage to scrape together thirty shillings to redeem the ring before she returned to school. Annie's mind was quickly made up. She would pawn the ring to someone, and trust to her lucky star to get it back before she returned to Lavender House....", "...supplied with every requisite by their friends. There was but little here which particularly attracted my attention. In clean, airy rooms, formed out of three cells, as in the prison, there lived together from eight to ten lunatics, many of whom appeared to be harmless and even happy, although, in the corner of the room, there certainly was a large iron cage for refractory or dangerous patients. In one of these groups stood a madman, who had been a medical student. He was about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years of age, extremely dark, exceedingly powerfully made,--and no sooner did I enter the room, than raising his eyes from a book which he was reading, he fixed them (folding his arms at the time) upon me, with a ferocity of countenance, which formed a very striking contrast to the expression of imbecility which characterized the rest of his companions. The longer he looked at me, the deeper and the darker was his frown; and though I steadily returned it, yet, from the flashing...", "...of the die.\" In a few instances, however, where there has been gross corruption, or a palpable combination against one of the parties, the law has interfered to reverse the proceedings. The case of Peter Williamson is one of these instances; and on the 3d of December 1768, some years after the poor Sheriff-Substitute had bidden himself from his disgrace by drinking himself into the grave, the Court awarded Peter Williamson damages to the extent of L200 against the persons who, nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years previously, had spirited him away from the pier of Aberdeen. The subsequent career of Peter Williamson, though not all directly our present purpose, is so inviting that we cannot pass it over.

But now I made it with no effort whatever. The growth and decay of the vegetation had gone on apace, and the whole aspect of the rocks had changed, but still it was possible to make out the slope on which the seeds had germinated, and the rocky mass from which we had taken our first view of the crater. But the spiky shrub on the slope stood brown and sere now, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet high, and cast long shadows that stretched out of sight, and the little seeds that clustered in its upper branches were brown and ripe. Its work was done, and it was brittle and ready to fall and crumple under the freezing air, so soon as the nightfall came.

In 1845 it carried away the suspension bridge between Beaucaire and Tarascon; the passage of the Rhone is often rendered impossible for days, through its violence. It has been found necessary to plant rows of cypress on each side of the line that crosses the Crau, to break the force of the wind upon the trains. Indeed, throughout the district, the fields will, in many places, be found walled up on all sides by plantations of cypresses from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> to fifty feet high, as screens against this terrible blast, to protect the crops from being literally blown out of the ground. When I was a child of five years my father's carriage with post horses was crossing the Crau. It was in summer. I sat on the box with my father and looked at the postilions. Presently I saw a number of little figures of men with peaked caps running about the horses and making attempts to scramble up them.

We had done all we could within working distance, but what was, the use of digging in drifts <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet deep? Amidst, and almost above, the terrible anxiety about our own individual safety,--for the snow was over the roof of many of the station-houses,--came the pressing question, \"Where are the sheep?\" A profound silence unbroken by bleat of lamb, or bark of dog, or any sound of life, had reigned for many days, when a merciful north-westerly gale sprung, up, and releasing the heavily-laden earth from its white bondage, freed the miserable remnant of our flocks and herds.

'Twas Franklin's hand that caught the horse; 'Twas harnessed by Professor Morse.\" Now, considering that Franklin made his discovery in 1752, and the United States were not formed till about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years afterward, it is rather \"transmogrifying\" history to say the lightning was tamed in the United States. Again, where the notice about Professor Morse was put, they say that the instrument was invented by Morse in 1846, while alongside it is shown the very slip which sent the message, dated 1844; so that the slip of the original message sent by Morse was sent by his instrument two years before it was invented.

This seemed almost hopeless, as it was found impossible to identify any \"rice-grain\" in the turmoil after a few minutes. But M. Hansky, of Pulkowa (whose recent death is deplored), introduced successfully a scheme of photography, which might almost be called a solar cinematograph. He took photographs of the sun at intervals of fifteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> seconds, and then enlarged selected portions of these two hundred times, giving a picture corresponding to a solar disc of six metres diameter. In these enlarged pictures he was able to trace the movements, and changes of shape and brightness, of individual rice-grains. Some granules become larger or smaller. Some seem to rise out of a mist, as it were, and to become clearer. Others grow feebler. Some are split in two.

Leading representatives of these classes began to hold conclaves in Kyoto. The meetings were marked by complete absence of ceremony, their object being to promote free interchange of ideas. Presently, suspicions were suggested to Kamakura. The regent, Takatoki, who, though a careless libertine in his habits, living in the society of his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> concubines, his troops of dancing mimes, and his packs of fighting dogs, was capable of stern resolution on occasions, threatened to dethrone the Emperor. In this sore strait, Go-Daigo did not hesitate to make solemn avowal of the innocence of his purpose, and Kamakura refrained from any harsh action towards the Throne.

While this load was being drawn home I had got my breakfast, and was ready to begin laying the first sheaf of the wheat-rick, which many times I had finished, though consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> large loads of sheaves, before the middle of the day; by which means, if the rain came, we had secured perhaps one hundred sacks of wheat, and these would prove worth from five to ten shillings a sack more than that which was left out to take the rain.

Ever since Lucilius, satire has been at once sharp and humorous, bitter and sweet.

[Sidenote: The Satires of Lucilius.] The _Satires_ of Lucilius were contained in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> books, each book containing several satires. The subjects treated were of all sorts--the faults and foibles of individuals, the defects of works of literature, the ridiculous imitation of Greek manners and dress, the absurdities of Greek mythology, the folly of expensive dinner parties, the author's journey to Sicily, Latin grammar, the proper spelling of Latin words, and Scipio's journey to Egypt and Asia.

He was formerly a captain of dragoons, a knight of St. Louis, of a noble countenance, prepossessing carriage and much elegance of manner. Guyon and Amiet have never been known by their real names. They owe that to the accommodating spirit prevailing among the vendors of passports of those days.

Quartz mining began as early as 1851. In 1908 about five-eighths of the gold output was from such mines. Quartz veins are very often as good at a depth of 3000 ft. as at the surface.

Gold was being produced in 1906 in more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> counties. The annual output since 1875 has been about $15,000,000 to $17,000,000; in 1905, according to the Mines Report, it was $18,898,545.

The Lord replied, 'This jewelled throne was created by the power of my merits, for I am he who will teach all men the remedy for death, who will redeem all beings, and set them free from the sorrows of circling existence.' Mara then claimed that the throne belonged to himself, and had been created by his own merits; and on this armed himself with the Chakkra, the irresistible weapon of Indra, and Wheel of the Law. Yet Buddha answered, 'By the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> virtues of transcendent merits, and the five alms, I have obtained the throne. Thou, in saying that this throne was created by thy merits, tellest an untruth, for indeed there is no throne for a sinful, horrible being such as thou art.'

I know one who now has been active in New York literary journalism for something like <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years--a fine intellectual figure of a man. He makes his living out of this, indeed, but his interest is in the thing itself, in literature.

The air of cheerfulness and beauty, however, which we annex to our notions of high cultivation, is wholly wanting. The appearance of the vines was that of sapless black stumps, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> inches high, and pruned so as to leave only four or five eyes; and though the subject of poverty is too serious to joke on, the withered and stunted appearance of the country people exactly corresponded to that of these dry pollards.

He was not only caressed, and treated, but had a collection made for him of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> pounds, with which it had been happy if he had immediately departed for London; but he never considered that such proofs of kindness were not often to be expected, and that this ardour of benevolence was, in a great degree, the effect of novelty.

Harry and I were together, Charley and Tom were stationed behind another screen, at a little distance off. We had to wait there for some time, when I heard Aboh, who was with us, whisper something. Presently my ears caught the sound of the trampling of hoofs, and directly afterwards I saw by the light of the moon, just then rising, a herd of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> or more magnificent animals emerging from the forest, and scattering themselves widely over the grassy plain in front of us. We were fortunately to leeward, or our shelter would have availed us nothing. We had now to wait patiently until some of the herd might make their way to our screen.

The bull terrier now rejoined me, and, in company with two additional natives who had run after us, I got on a piece of rock about three feet high.

Sore and angry, he presently emerged from the jungle at a distance of about twenty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> yards further down the slope of the hill. I fired at and hit him, and he then turned round, took a look at us, and charged. As he came on I fired my remaining shot.

To the amazement of all, Agafya accepted the blow which had overtaken her with humble submission. She was then over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years of age, all her children had died, and her husband did not long survive. The time had arrived for her to come to a sense of her position; she did so.

The genealogy of Levi's family (Exod. 6:16-20) decidedly favors the interpretation, which divides the period of four hundred and thirty years between Egypt and the land of Canaan. To make this table consistent with a sojourn of four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years in Egypt, it would be necessary to assume, with some, that it is an _epitome_, not a full list, which does not seem probable. Before we can draw any certain argument from the increase of the people in Egypt, we must know the _basis of calculation_.

And perhaps it was by reason of this precedence that Christopher Whitrid, Knight, in the reign of Henry VI., gave the name of Judas to the College which he had founded.

In the winter we could stand him, because he wore shoes then, and his great gift was hidden from our sight and we were enabled to forget it. But in the summer-time he was a bitterness to us.

There was her husband, a son, and six daughters, all handsome, but especially the harlequin with whom I was much taken. Naturally I fell in love with her, but as I was her senior by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years, and had begun my addresses in a tone of fatherly affection, a feeling of shame prevented my disclosing to her the real state of my heart.

One day in early June I was walking with some friends along a secluded wood-road. Above the hum of the conversation I caught the distressed cry of a pair of blue jays. My companions heard it also, but did not heed it. But to my ear the cry was peculiar. It was uttered in a tone of anguish and alarm. I said, \"Let us see what is the trouble with these jays.\" I presently saw a nest twenty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet from the ground in a small hemlock which I at once concluded belonged to the jays. The birds were but a few yards away, hopping about amid the neighboring branches, uttering now and then their despairing note. Looking more intently at the nest, I became aware in the dim light of the tree of something looped about it, or else there was a dark, very crooked limb that partly held it. Suspecting the true nature of the case, I threw a stone up through the branches, and then...", "...and we cease asking _why_ it is, and shall only inquire _what_ it is. To this science returns a clear reply. In the anatomy of woman there are two small bodies, in shape and size like large almonds, called the ovaries. They lie one on each side of the womb, and are connected with it by tubes about four inches in length. These bodies are solid, but contain a great number of diminutive vesicles, which, by some mysterious law of nature, mature one at a time, every thirty days, for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years of woman's life. When mature, the vesicle separates from the ovary, traverses the tube into the womb, and is thence expelled and lost, or becomes, by contact with the other sex, the germ of a living being. This process is accompanied by a disturbance of the whole system. Wandering pains are felt; a sense of languor steals over the mind; the blood rushes with increased violence through the vessels, and more or less of it escapes from the veins, causing that change which we...", "...king will rule in the land.

The musical progress that has been effected in France during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years is immense. This may be largely attributed to the initiative of Pasdeloup[29] the organiser and conductor of the celebrated concerts which were started at the Cirque d'Hiver in 1861, and to the zeal and talent of his successors Messrs.

The young couple were in haste to ascend the throne. They could not, however, do this until the Duke of Parma should die or abdicate. The unaccommodating old duke refused to do either.

But he had always been a speculative man, one whose temperament was too ardent, and he entered into the South Sea project with his whole heart, embarking in it his entire capital. He was a widower, and had an only son, named Alexander, who, at the age of twenty-one, he took into partnership with himself. The senior Mr Hamilton was a man who well knew the painful labour attending...", "...canes forms a gradation, passing from light yellow through striped red and yellow, and red. The cultivation is, as stated, principally carried on in Upper Egypt-- for the manufacture of sugar. If it is planted in the Delta it is for sale to the natives, by whom it is consumed raw, and by sucking the juice. The farmer who plants his land with sugar-cane begins by thoroughly well preparing the soil, and ridges it as if he were about to plant potatoes, these ridges measuring about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> inches from crest to crest. The canes are cut into lengths of one yard, placed in the furrow, and covered with the soil. Planting commences in February, the ridges being watered immediately after, and the young shoots appear after twenty days. The crop is watered every fifteen days, and at longer intervals after the Nile has risen. The land is hand-hoed three times, and the cane should be ready for cutting in December and January.

Finding insufficient pasturage for the cattle at Santa Maria, they advanced to Velicata, some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> miles distant, and here was assembled the land expedition. In addition to the officers named, Don Miguel Costanso, ensign of royal engineers, was ordered to join the expedition as cosmographer and diarist, and Don Pedro Prat was appointed physician.

When within <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> yards of it I stepped on a stick that snapped, and simultaneously with the sound a monster buck leaped high in the air, and landing twenty feet away, uttered a shrill whistle and stopped, with his head thrown up, to try and locate the danger.

There have been instances, but fortunately few, of wolves with a perfect craving for human flesh. Such was the notorious Bete (or beast) du Gevaudan, that from the year 1764 and onwards ravaged the district of that name, in Auvergne, to the south of the centre of France. This wolf was of enormous size, measuring six feet from the point of its nose to the tip of its tail. It devoured eighty-three persons, principally women and children, and seriously wounded twenty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> others. It was attacked from first to last by between _two and three hundred thousand_ hunters, probably not all at once.

When the alternating current was introduced for practical purposes it was not needed for arc lighting, the circuit for which, from a single dynamo, would often be twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> miles in length, its current having a pressure of not less than five or six thousand volts. For some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating-current circuits, and that reason was often urged against it seriously. It could not be used for electroplating or deposition, nor could it charge storage batteries, all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current.

Three-fourths of our time is probably spent in work. Of course the meaning of it is that our work should be just as religious as our worship, and unless we can work for the glory of God three-fourths of life remains unsanctified. The proof that work is religious is that most of Christ's life was spent in work.

It is not our province to analyze the motives of the Swedish King, the \"Lion of the North,\" as he is called. How much he was actuated by ambition, how much by religion, perhaps he himself might have found it hard to say. His coming marks the turning-point of the contest; his brilliant achievements constitute the fourth period of the war. Tilly opposed him with the army of the Catholic League--Tilly, the victor of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> desperate battles. The Emperor and his court laughed, and, thinking of the Bohemian King and the Dane, said: \"Another of these snow kings has come against us. He, too, will melt in our southern sun.\" The Protestant princes hesitated, fearing to join Gustavus; he was hampered on every side.

On the south side of the valley of Hinnom, and near its junction with Kedron, is the potter's field. It is a small parcel of ground near the top of the bank with an old ruined house on it. There was a small level spot <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet below the top of the bank, at the bottom of a thick stratum of horizontal rock. Walls have been made enclosing a part of this--the face of the rock forming the south wall of the building. The roof, which is flat, is on a level with the top of the bank; and in it are a number of holes, through which they used to throw the dead bodies.

The fact is none the less true, however, and the colder the day the more apparent it became. Space and a lack of culinary room in the mission-house, compelled an arrangement which permitted of only twenty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> eating at one time, so that a line had to be formed outside and an orderly entrance effected. This caused a daily spectacle which, however, had become so common by repetition during a number of years that now nothing was thought of it.

They ate and went away again, some of them returning regularly day after day...", "...quite a distance ahead, but they soon caught up to his car.

Perhaps it would have been better had he commented on it and asked what association to-day's expedition had with what had happened during <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> odd years. He passed the matter over in silence, and in that instant Bryce guessed that the man knew as much, if not more, than he did. \"Do you know why I advertised that expedition as dangerous?\" Bryce asked, seeing that the other made no attempt to reply.

But she hesitated to speak to him, for she felt that the crisis had come. Suddenly he sprang up, and walked toward her with all the deliberate firmness of a man in his whole bearing. She says there was something in his face which she has never seen since, and does not expect to see till he is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years old. \"Mamma!\" said he. \"Well, dear?\" said his mother, trembling so that she could hardly speak. \"Mamma,\" he repeated, in a loud, sharp tone, \"G!

From that day to this his mother has never had a contest with him; she has always been able to leave all practical questions affecting his behavior to his own decision, merely saying, \"Willy, I think...", "...she came back to Kizuki. She was learned, and a great poet in the style called _renga_. After Sanza's death she supported herself, or at least occupied herself, in teaching this poetic art. But she shaved off her hair and became a nun, and built the little Buddhist temple in Kizuki called Rengaji, in which she lived, and taught her art. And the reason she built the temple was that she might pray for the soul of the _ronin_ whom the sight of her beauty had ruined. The temple stood until <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years ago. Nothing is now left of it but a broken statue of Jiz[=o].

(a) Fall in E.M.F. at beginning of discharge.--At the moment when previous charging ceases the pores of the positive plate contain strong acid, brought there by the charging current. There is consequently a high E.M.F. But the strong acid begins to diffuse away at once and the E.M.F. falls rapidly. Even if the cell were not discharged this fall would occur, and if it were allowed to rest for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> minutes or so the discharge would have begun with the dotted line (fig. 13). (b) Final rapid fall.---The pores being clogged by sulphate the plugs cannot get acid by diffusion, and when 5% is reached the fall in E.M.F. is disproportionately large (see fig. 10). If discharge be stopped, there is an almost instantaneous diffusion inwards and a rapid rise in E.M.F.

The silence of death, broken only by moans, succeeded to the joyous sounds of a festival. A single cannon-shot echoed along the plain of the ocean. A cold sweat rolled from the officer's brow. He wore no sword. He was confident that his soldiers were murdered, and that the English were about to disembark. He saw himself dishonored if he lived, summoned before a council of war to explain...", "...may say that the First and Fourth are relatively quiet acts, the Third highly critical. A good example is the Third Act of _King Lear_, where the scenes of high tension (ii., iv., vi.) are respectively 95, 186 and 122 lines in length, while those of low tension (i., iii., v.) are respectively 55, 26 and 26 lines long.

Both might have been very serious affairs. With the closing out of the Mortgage Company's interests of course my salaried employment came to an end. But before closing this chapter it should be mentioned that I had in the meantime suffered a nasty accident by a pony falling back on me and fracturing one leg. It occurred at the round-up, and I was driven some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> miles, the leg not even splinted or put in a box, to my ranch. I sent off a mounted man to Las Vegas, 130 miles, for a surgeon, but it was a week before he got down to me and the leg was then in a pretty bad shape. He hinted at removing it, but finally decided to set it and put it in plaster, which he did. He then left me. The leg gave me little trouble, but unfortunately peritonitis set in. The agony then suffered will not soon be forgotten.

The stream and the natives were not long in giving the adventurers a taste of their peculiarities. A dangerous rapid had to be shot. The natives swarmed out in their canoes. The passage of the river was like a running fight. On November 23, 1877, while the expedition was encamped on the banks of the river at the mouth of the Ruiki, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> native canoes made a determined attack, which was only repulsed by force. On December 8, the expedition was again attacked by fourteen canoes, which had to be driven back with a volley. But the fiercest attack was toward the end of December, when a fleet of canoes containing 600 men bore down upon them with a fearful din of war-drums and horns, and the battle cry \"Bo-bo, Bo-bo, bo-bo-o-o-oh!\" Simultaneously with the canoe attack a terrible uproar broke out in the forest behind...", "...so long was it, always showed above the water; whereupon they drew it out and left it with the Abbot; for ever could they see the flames of the towns in Kesteven draw nigher and nigher, and feared lest the Heathen should on a sudden burst in upon them.

The whole of the barb turned on a stout pivot of steel, but was kept in line with the shaft by a tiny wooden peg which passed through barb and shaft, being then cut off smoothly on both sides. The point of the harpoon had at one side a wedge-shaped edge, ground to razor keenness, the other side was flat. The shaft, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> inches long, was of the best malleable iron, so soft that it would tie into a knot and straighten out again without fracture.

To retain the British method requires certain things, determinable by arithmetic. If, for argument's sake, we allow that the aggregate of 1,716 British soldiers engaged in the 4 early battles was opposed by the same aggregate of Boers, we have this result: the British loss of 700 and the Boer loss of 23 argues that in order to equalize results in future battles you must make the British force <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> times as strong as the Boer force. Mr. Garrett shows that the Boer force immediately opposed to Jameson was 2,000, and that there were 6,000 more on hand by the evening of the second day. Arithmetic shows that in order to make himself the equal of the 8,000 Boers, Jameson should have had 240,000 men, whereas he merely had 530 boys. From a military point of view, backed by the facts of history, I conceive that Jameson's military judgment was at fault.

As mentioned in the preceding chapter, a mixture of acid and water in which the acid composes <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> per cent of the electrolyte has the minimum resistance. Diluting or increasing the concentration of the electrolyte will both cause an increase in resistance from the minimum I value.

In proof of his power to do this he exhibited his wife. She was a handsome young woman of very shady reputation whom he had married on his travels. She professed to be sixty years of age, though she was really under <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> and looked it, but she claimed that she had a son who had served for many years in the Dutch army. This imposition was so effective that in Strasburg, and subsequently in Paris, the charming pair collected large sums from wealthy old persons, especially from women on whom the marks of time had begun to show, and who expected, as the result of the treatment, to be shortly as young and as handsome-looking as Madame Cagliostro herself.

It was called by its discoverers \"The House of the Sixteen Windows.\" Behind this house the cliff-side rises smooth and perpendicular <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet, but it can be scaled by an ancient stairway cut into it which ascends to a still higher ledge. The stairs lead to the very door of another house filling a niche a hundred and twenty feet long.

Regulation IX of 1833 established a workable system, and provided for the appointment of Indian Deputy Collectors with adequate powers. The settlements of the North-Western Provinces made under this Regulation were, for the most part, reasonably fair, and were generally confirmed for a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years.

As soon as the idea takes root that every man has a mission of mercy, and that the more cruel are not at liberty to vent their barbarous feelings on helpless creatures, whether man or beast, a strong uprising of humane activity will take place which will demand the formation of societies for the prevention of cruelty and for carrying active relief to the distressed and wretched.

In the efforts of the present day to economize space by using a minimum length of film, pictures are frequently taken at too slow a rate, and the reproductions are therefore often objectionable, by reason of more or less jerkiness. During the experimental period and up to the early part of 1889, the kodak film was being slowly developed by the Eastman Kodak Company. Edison perceived in this product the solution of the problem on which he had been working, because...", "...check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.

There he met with welcome and protection, as did many a political fugitive of the time, from Renee, the reigning duchess, as kindly a creature as was her father, Louis XII. of France.

Marot, who was with Calvin in Ferrara, went back to Paris, still countenanced at court; but no favor of king or king's sister could save a sinner who would eat meat during Lent; and in 1543 Marot was forced to flee to Italy, and died in Turin in 1544.

Her book was not progressing as fast as she had expected when she began it. She had been working at it sporadically now for eight weeks, and she had only ten chapters done,--and some of these were terribly short. She had looked through all of the novels that she owned, and had computed the average number of chapters in each; thirty she decided would be a good, conservative number to write. She had even divided those <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> into three parts, and had impartially allotted ten to adventure, ten to mystery and horror, and ten to love-making. Such an arrangement should please everybody, surely, and need only be worked out smoothly to prove most satisfying.

One of the least shocking of Dingarn's acts was the exhibiting the powers of a burning-glass that had been given him, by burning a hole in the wrist of one of his servants; and his indifference to the pain and death of others was frightful. His own brother, the next in succession, was, with his two servants, put to death through some jealousy; and, more horrible still, every living creature in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> villages belonging to him was massacred as a matter of course.

In fact, the adherents to Christianity became so numerous and so influential that the Shogun, Hideyoshi, began to fear for his temporal power, and, having absolute authority, he expelled the foreigners, closed the ports and established the policy of non-intercourse with other nations--a policy which was followed until 1853.

Indeed, from a fourteenth-century drawing[92] in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, it is possible the upper storeys may have been originally set back. The squat appearance of the columns of the arcade is due to the raising of the level of the Piazzetta, which in the days when the palace was built was some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> inches below the present pavement.[93] The original building was approached by a stylobate of three steps which greatly added to its dignity and proportion.

From the early history of sorghum, it appears that it was known as _sorgo_ in the sixteenth century, while twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> varieties were known under different names in Egypt, Arabia, and Africa. Some of the names are, Chinese sugar cane, (sorgo), India cane, emphee or Coffers' bread, paindes anges, etc. The later history of it shows that in 1850, Count Montigny sent the first samples from China to Europe.

The lion had his paw already on the missionary's head, when a Christian native ran up and struck and slashed at the brute. The lion loosed his hold in order to fly at his new assailant, who was badly hurt. Fortunately the animal was so sorely wounded that its strength was now exhausted, and it fell dead on the ground. Livingstone felt the effects of the lion's bite for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years after, and could never lift his arm higher than the shoulder; and when his course was run his body was identified by the broken and reunited arm bone.

There was no adequate way of expressing their gratitude and pleasure, but the farmer seemed well content with Specs' explosive, \"You bet we do!\" It was curious about Mr. Jenkins.

It would be strange were it otherwise, considering the ease with which a record of days could be kept from Nile flood to Nile flood, or from solstice to solstice. But this, of course, applies only to an approximate count. There is some reason to believe that in the earliest period the Egyptians made this count only 360 days. The fact that their year was divided into twelve months of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> days each lends color to this belief; but, in any event, the mistake was discovered in due time and a partial remedy was applied through the interpolation of a \"little month\" of five days between the end of the twelfth month and the new year. This nearly but not quite remedied the matter. What it obviously failed to do was to take account of that additional quarter of a day which really rounds out the actual year.

Here was new cause for strife between the Nashes and the Sykeses. Which of these ladies should secure the nobleman for the fancy ball? True, the earl was very young, awkward as the school-boy he was, and really looked more like a juvenile horse-jockey than a civilized gentleman. But he was an _earl_; would assuredly have a seat in the House of Lords, if ever he became old enough; besides, he had already lost <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> thousand dollars at the gaming-table, and bore it like a prince. Here was an object worth contending for. What American lady would be immortalized by leaning upon the arm of an earl as she entered the assembly room? No minor claims could be put in here.

The two wrote begging letters in every possible key, from the jovial \"Fork me out <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> thalers immediately,\" to the heartrending supplication, \"If you don't want me to be ruined, have mercy,\" etc. Paul passed many a sleepless night thinking how to help them, and it frequently happened that he deprived himself of something necessary so as to be able to send them the money. Once Gottfried had written that he had no decent clothes and urgently needed a summer suit. Paul just wanted a summer suit himself, for he had outgrown his old one; sighing, he put the money...", "...When I first heard this, I could hardly credit it, but found out by personal investigation that it was the actual fact.

He therefore urged Agesilaus to undertake a campaign in Asia as the champion of Greece, and advised him to land upon some distant part of the coast, so as to establish himself securely before the arrival of the Persian army. At the same time he despatched instructions to his friends in Asia, to send to Lacedaemon, and demand Agesilaus as their general. In a public debate upon the subject, Agesilaus agreed to conduct the war if he were furnished with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> Spartans to act as generals, and to form a council of war. He also demanded a force of ten thousand picked men of the Neodamodes, or enfranchised Helots, and six thousand hoplites, or heavy armed troops, from the allied cities in Greece.

At afternoon \"at homes,\" ladies are present in a considerable majority, there being usually from about ten gentlemen to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> ladies on an average present at these gatherings. Ladies have a decided partiality for this class of entertainment, as it affords an opportunity for meeting their friends and acquaintances, or for making new acquaintances, and for forming future plans and interchanging civilities; and even in the height of the London season, afternoon \"at homes\" are fully attended by the members of the fashionable world.

It was proposed that for the future there should be twenty boats of 150 tons each, and with a complement of eighteen men. These boats would cost about L3000 apiece to build, and would not be the property of the Government. The Government would simply hire them, giving as the price of hire L1350 a year, which was to cover everything, wages and victualling included. The owners would also have the passage money, estimated at L150, for each boat.

This double sovereignty worked admirably; for five centuries there were no attempts on the part of the Spartan kings to subvert the constitution. The power of the joint kings, it should be added, was rather nominal than real (save in time of war); so that while the Spartan government was monarchical in form, it was in reality an aristocracy, the Spartans corresponding very closely to the feudal lords of medi\u00e6val Europe. The Senate consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> elders. The powers of this body were at first almost unlimited. After a time, however, officers called ephors were elected by the Popular Assembly, and these gradually absorbed the powers and functions of the Senate, as well as the authority of the two associate kings.

To this science returns a clear reply. In the anatomy of woman there are two small bodies, in shape and size like large almonds, called the ovaries. They lie one on each side of the womb, and are connected with it by tubes about four inches in length. These bodies are solid, but contain a great number of diminutive vesicles, which, by some mysterious law of nature, mature one at a time, every <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> days, for thirty years of woman's life. When mature, the vesicle separates from the ovary, traverses the tube into the womb, and is thence expelled and lost, or becomes, by contact with the other sex, the germ of a living being. This process is accompanied by a disturbance of the whole system. Wandering pains are felt; a sense of languor steals over the mind; the blood rushes with increased violence through the vessels, and more or less of it escapes from the veins, causing that...", "...who were terrified by it had brought it into Europe.

In the depths of night, the rapacious monster, profiting by the hour when the approaches to the city are less carefully guarded, with a gloomy but subdued sound, as if stifled by the soft down which covers it (and all other nocturnal insects), invaded the hive, swooped down on the combs, devoured and plundered, gutted and destroyed the magazines, and slew the infant bees.

He remained here but a short time, and then returned to Boston and entered on the practice of medicine. In 1847 he was appointed professor at Harvard, filling a similar position to the one held at Dartmouth. He discharged the duties of his professorship for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years, with great success. Literature was never his profession; yet few American authors attained higher success, both as a poet and as a prose writer. His poems are lively and sparkling, abound in wit and humor, but are not wanting in genuine pathos. Many of them were composed for special occasions.

In a few instances, I have noticed small hammers, usually egg-shaped, without a groove; and the battered or worn appearance at one end was all that induced the belief that they were ever used for hammering. These hammers are usually from six to eight inches in length, and from eight to twelve inches in circumference, and weigh from four to eight pounds; but I have measured specimens that were twenty-four inches in circumference at the groove, and would weigh <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> pounds. It seems hardly probable that one man could wield so ponderous a tool; and from the fact that some of the large mauls have two grooves around them, it is presumed that two men were employed in using them.

It was equally plain that the sentiment against slavery in the North had increased greatly in distinctness and intensity. There was apparent, too, a divergence of material interests, and a keen rivalry of political interests. The South had been losing ground in comparison. From an equality in population, the North had gained a majority of 600,000 in a total of 10,000,000. The approaching census of 1820 would give the North a preponderance of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> in the House. In wealth, too, the North had been obviously drawing ahead. Only in the Senate did the South retain an equality of power, and, to maintain at least this, by the accession of new slave States, was an avowed object of Southern politicians.

McKeown gives the history of a blind fiddler of sixty-three, who, when one and a half years old, had lost the sight of both eyes after an attack of small-pox. Iridectomy was performed, and after over sixty years of total blindness his sight was restored; color-perception was good.

Apparently, huge bulging masses of a lurid-coloured lava were wallowing the whole time one over another in a central whirlpool, which occasionally flung up a wave of fire <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> or forty feet. The greatest intensity of action was always preceded by a dull throbbing roar, as if the imprisoned gases were seeking the vent which was afforded them by the upward bulging of the wave and its bursting into spray.

The venture did not receive the support hoped for; and the paper was turned over to Douglass's two [oldest] sons, Lewis and Frederick, and was finally abandoned [in 1874], Douglass having sunk about ten thousand dollars in the enterprise. Later newspapers for circulation among the colored people have proved more successful; and it ought to be a matter of interest that the race which <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> years ago could not support one publication, edited by its most prominent man, now maintains several hundred newspapers which make their appearance regularly. In 1871 Douglass was elected president of the Freedmans Bank. This ill-starred venture was then apparently in the full tide of prosperity, and promised to be a great lever in the uplifting of the submerged race. Douglass, soon after his election as president, discovered the insolvency of the institution, and insisted...", "...the luxuriant herbage of the highly cultivated lands of England--it possesses unequalled earliness of maturity; and its mutton, when not too fat, is of a good quality, but is usually coarse, and comparatively deficient in flavor, owing to that unnatural state of fatness which it so readily assumes, and which the breeder, to gain weight, so generally feeds for. The wethers, having reached their second year, are turned off in the succeeding February or March, and weigh at that age from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> to thirty-five pounds to the quarter. The wool of the New Leicester is long, averaging, after the first shearing, about six inches; and the fleece of the American animal weighs about six pounds. It is of coarse quality, and little used in the manufacture of cloth, on account of its length, and that deficiency of felting properties common, in a greater or less extent, to all English breeds. As a combing wool, however, it stands first, and is used in the manufacture of the finest...", "...fathers [of the Society]; and of a victory gained by our men_. An excellent and large fleet has left this great island of Mindanao during these last few days to punish the insolence of the Dutch and of the Joloans, the neighbors of Mindanao, who are robbing the country from us and capturing the Indians of these Filipinas. The fleet is there, and I was to embark with it, but in order not to leave this district alone Father Fabricio Sersali, a Sicilian, went. The fleet consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> ships and more, and in them sailed two hundred Spaniards and innumerable Indian soldiers and rowers. May our Lord give us the success that we hope. [56] A fleet of two galleons with high freeboard has also left, and in them four companies of soldiers, in pursuit of the Dutch enemy who were in Macan and along the coast of Great China. Advices were received of a Dutch ship which was carrying one million pesos' worth of wealth. The result has not been ascertained as yet....", "...immorality our country is chargeable with, namely, the too great use of ardent spirits, substituting in their place a wholesome and invigorating beverage. The person, therefore, whoever he may be, who contributes his money, or his talents, to this useful and moral purpose, deserves to rank high among the best friends of his country. Under these impressions it is that I beg leave to recommend to my fellow citizens the immediate establishment of a brewing company, with a capital of from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> to forty thousand dollars, to be subscribed for in shares the most likely to be made up. With either of these sums a handsome beginning could be made, and the profits would in a few years encourage and justify enlargement to any prudent extent that could be reasonably wished for or required. In proof of the correctness of this opinion, I will beg leave to state a fact that has happened in my own time. When the mercantile house of Beamish & Crawford, of Cork, erected a porter...", "...their hands and feet. Where the ledges overhung, the men were drawn up by ropes to the platforms above. But not only was this the case with men, but with their oxen. Jean passed and saluted a farmer who was in process of placing his beasts in a position of security for the night. His wife was above, in the rock, and was working a windlass by means of which an ox was being gradually lifted from the ground by broad bands passed under its belly, and so was raised to the height of some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty</span> feet, where the beast, accustomed to this proceeding, quickly stepped on to a narrow path cut in the rock, and walked to its stable, also rock-hewn in the face of the cliff. In another place was a woman with her children closing up the opening of a grotto that was level with the soil. This was effected by a board which fitted into a rebate in the rock, and then the woman, after putting her children within, heaped stones and sods against the board to disguise it; and when this...", "...Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.
