The command appears to have been given, at his own request, to General Kearney; and as the wagon train was heavily laden, the progress of the column was very slow--the expedition reaching the Rio San Gabriel on January 8, 1847--although the enemy had offered no opposition to its progress even in passes where a small force could have effectively kept it back.

The station of Cawnpore was commanded by Sir Hugh Wheeler, a distinguished general in the company's service, who was verging on his seventieth year. He had spent <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years in India, and had served only with native troops. He must have known the sepoys better than any other European in India.

His two long poems, \"Venus and Adonis\" and \"The Rape of Lucrece,\" contain much poetic fancy; but it must be said of both that the subjects are unpleasant, and that they are dragged out to unnecessary length in order to show the play of youthful imagination. They were extremely popular in Shakespeare's day, but in comparison with his great dramatic works these poems are now of minor importance. Shakespeare's _Sonnets_, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> in number, are the only direct expression of the poet's own feelings that we possess; for his plays are the most impersonal in all literature. They were published together in 1609; but if they had any unity in Shakespeare's mind, their plan and purpose are hard to discover. By some critics they are regarded as mere literary exercises; by others as the expression of some personal grief during the third period of the poet's literary career. Still others, taking a hint from the...", "...which they conjure up in the mind. \"Kubla Khan\" is a fragment, painting a gorgeous Oriental dream picture, such as one might see in an October sunset.

His stubbornness and folly not only ended the intense patriotic feeling of the previous reign, but laid the foundation for the deadly conflict that resulted. In <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years after the defeat of the Armada, England was plunged into civil war. The guiding belief of James I. was that kings governed by divine right, that they received from the Deity a title of which no one could lawfully deprive them, no matter how outrageously they ruled, and that they were not in any way responsible to Parliament or to the people. In acting on this belief, he first trampled on the religious liberty of his subjects. He drove from their churches hundreds of...", "...century there was intermittent war with France. Under Anne (1702-1714) the Duke of Marlborough won many remarkable victories against France. The most worthy goal of French antagonism, expansion of trade, and displacement of the French in America and India, was not at this time clearly apparent. Anne's successor was the Hanoverian Elector, George I. (1714-1727), a descendant of the daughter of James I., who had married a German prince. At the time of his accession, George I. was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years old and could speak no English. He seldom attended the meetings of his cabinet, since he could not understand the deliberations. This circumstance led to further decline of royal power, so that his successor, George II. (1727-1760), said: \"Ministers are the king in this country.\" The history of the rest of this period centers around the great prime minister, Robert Walpole, whose ministry lasted from 1715-1717 and from 1721-1742.

He avails himself, it is true, of the peculiar language of the physician, the divine, the husbandman, the soldier, and the sailor; but he uses these only on very rare occasions, by way of description, comparison, or illustration, when something in the scene or...", "...them. But the technical language of the law runs from his pen as part of his vocabulary and parcel of his thought. The word \"purchase,\" for instance, which in ordinary use means to acquire by giving value, in law applies to all legal modes of obtaining property, except inheritance of descent. And the word in this peculiar and most technical sense occurs five times in Shakespeare's thirty-seven plays, but only in a single passage (if our memory and Mr. Dyce's notes serve us) in the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> plays of Beaumont and Fletcher. Equal, or greater, is the comparative frequency with which Shakespeare uses other legal phrases; and much wider is the disparity, in this regard, between him and the other dramatic writers of his whole period,--Marlowe, Greene, Peele, Kyd, Lilly, Chapman, Jonson, Middleton, Marston, Ford, Webster, Massinger, and the undistinguished crowd.

One looks straight down upon the vast frozen river called the Gorner Glacier, from the Gorner Grat, a sheer precipice twelve hundred feet high. We had one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> umbrellas--and what is an umbrella but a parachute?

Its peculiar and unvaried construction must inevitably inflict upon it something of pedantry and monotony, and although some powerful minds have used it as a form for condensing and elaborating a particular train of thought--_an Iliad in a nutshell_--yet the vast majority of sonneteers employ it as an economical expedient, by which one idea can be expanded into fourteen lines--fourteen lines into one page--and, as we see, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> pages into a costly volume. The complex construction, which at first sight seems a difficulty, is, in fact, like all mechanism, a great saving of labour to the operator.

On the sea side of the mountains the fiords rival the lakes in depth. Milford Sound is 1,100 feet deep near its innermost end. But enough of the scenery of the Colony.

As he had no guns he tried the effect of rockets, but though terrified by the strange fire, the defenders gained heart when they found that the rockets hit nothing. They even charged the English in the open with long-handled tomahawks, and only fell back before a bayonet charge in regular form. After skirmishing all day and losing <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> in killed and wounded with but negative results, the English retreated to Auckland to request artillery. Waka Nene carried on the fighting on his own account, and in a skirmish with him Heke was badly wounded. Guns were fetched from Australia, and Heke's men were brought to bay at their principal _pa_, Ohaeawai.

The laws which regulate retail shops do not aim at securing what is known as early closing. A weekly half-holiday for all, employer and employed alike; a <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> hours' working week for women and young persons; seats for shop girls, and liberty to use them; sanitary inspection of shops. These were the objects of those who framed the acts, and these have been attained. Under a special section merchants' offices must close at 5 o'clock p.m. during two-thirds of each month.

In the meantime Barbicane was making his arrangements in the projectile as though he was never going to leave it. It will be remembered that the base of the aerial vehicle was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> feet square. It was twelve feet high, and admirably fitted up in the interior. It was not much encumbered by the instruments and travelling utensils, which were all in special places, and it left some liberty of movement to its three inhabitants.

They had only been five hours and forty minutes more than half the time assigned for the accomplishment of their journey, but they had come more than seven-tenths of the distance. This peculiarity was due to their regularly-decreasing speed. When they looked at the earth through the port-light at the bottom, it only looked like a black spot drowned in the sun's rays. No crescent or pale light was now to be seen. The next day at midnight the earth...", "...used as a spring and the movable partitions. The partitions still existed, but water was wanting, for they could not use the reserve for this purpose--that would be precious in case the liquid element should fail on the lunar soil. Besides, this reserve would not have been sufficient for a spring. The layer of water stored in the projectile at their departure, and on which lay the waterproof disc, occupied no less than three feet in depth, and spread over a surface of not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> feet square. Now the receptacles did not contain the fifth part of that. They were therefore obliged to give up this effectual means of deadening the shock. Fortunately Barbicane, not content with employing water, had furnished the movable disc with strong spring buffers, destined to lessen the shock against the bottom, after breaking the horizontal partitions. These buffers were still in existence; they had only to be fitted on and the movable disc put in its place. All...", "...fifty women and girls, and possibly double that number of men, old and young, every one mounted and galloping from one point of the field to another.

When he apologized to Miss Jean for his bad luck, hat in hand and his eyes as big as saucers, one would have supposed he had brought lasting disgrace on Las Palomas.

Riders drew their mounts by lot, and Pasquale drew a cinnamon-colored coyote from the ranch of \"Uncle Nate\" Wilson of...", "...the key to the door was, Billy seemed to feel hurt. What did Billy know about a key, and what use had he ever found for one in that hospitable spot, whither famished folk of every class gravitated naturally for the flying succor of Billy's larder? \"The door never had a key,\" said Billy. \"Only once in all the time I have been here has the place been closed, and then it was but four hours.\" Down in New Orleans there is a famous old saloon called the Sazeraz.

William the Second, German Emperor and King of Prussia, Burgrave of Nuernberg, Margrave of Brandenburg, Landgrave of Hessen and Thuringia, Prince of Orange, Knight of the Garter and Field-Marshal of Great Britain, etc., was born in Berlin on January 27, 1859, and ascended the throne on June 15, 1888. He is, therefore, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years old in the present year of his Jubilee, 1913, and his reign--happily yet unfinished--has extended over a quarter of a century. The Englishman who would understand the Emperor and his time must imagine a country with a monarchy, a government, and a people--in short, a political system--almost entirely different from his own. In Germany, paradoxical though it may sound to English ears, there is neither a government nor a people. The word \"government\" occurs only once...", "...idea. Before that, it's a mere nuisance.'

The Opposition attempted to meet this by presenting a number of petitions showing that the people of Ireland were against it. Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> petitions presented, five were not against the Union at all, but merely requests for compensation in the event of its coming about; three were from individuals or commercial firms; and eight were from Dublin alone.

(i) The Crimes Prevention Act passed by Gladstone in 1882 had lapsed, having been limited to a period of three years. Mr. Balfour (who had become Chief Secretary) was of opinion that the continual passing of temporary measures was a mistake (as some one has said, it was like a man burning his umbrella every fine day and then complaining of the expense of buying so many new ones), as was shown by the fact that the Irish Parliament had passed <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> of such Acts in the seventeen years of its independent existence. He therefore, in spite of vehement opposition from the combined forces of the English Radicals and the Irish Nationalists, carried the Crimes Act of 1887, which was a permanent measure, to be put in force in disturbed districts by proclamation when necessary.

It is necessary to mention briefly the condition of the military navies, which were to have an importance as yet unrealized. Neither precise numbers nor an exact account of condition of the ships can be given; but the relative efficiency can be fairly estimated.

In 1734 this number had fallen to seventy ships-of-the-line and nineteen 50-gun ships.

Well, here was Tommie adrift in Lima after five weeks to sea, and in all that time he hadn't had a drink, and he wanted one now.

COMPARISON OF THESEUS AND ROMULUS. I. The above are all the noteworthy particulars which we have been able to collect about Theseus and Romulus. It seems, in the first place, that Theseus of his own free will, and without any compulsion, when he might have reigned peacefully in Troezen, where he was heir to the kingdom, no mean one, longed to accomplish heroic deeds:...", "...altogether without knowledge. During the reign of Romulus the months had been in a state of great disorder, some not containing twenty days, some five-and-thirty, and some even more, because the Romans could not reconcile the discrepancies which arise from reckoning by the sun and the moon, and only insisted upon one thing, that the year should consist of three hundred and sixty days. Numa reckoned the variation to consist of eleven days, as the lunar year contains three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> days, and the solar year three hundred and sixty-five. He doubled these eleven days and introduced them every other year, after February, as an intercalary month, twenty-two days in duration, which was called by the Romans Mercedinus. This was a remedy for the irregularities of the calendar which itself required more extensive remedies. He also altered the order of the months, putting March, which used to be the first month, third, and making January the first, which in...", "...(Omaha), with a seraphic smile that disarmed controversy. * * * * * The GERMAN EMPEROR has lately rearranged his scheme of work for weekdays.

Canaan on both sides of the Jordan was made into a province, and governed much as India is to-day. Some of the cities were allowed still to retain their old line of princes, who were called upon to furnish tribute to the Egyptian treasury and recruits to the Egyptian army.

This day we saw a turtle, and several albatrosses, but still had no ground with 180 fathom.

Just at this time we saw a sea-lion rise twice near the shore, the head of which exactly resembled that of the male which has been described in the account of Lord Anson's voyage.

In the changed circumstances of the country, and with regard to the modern developments of the art of war, the Gwalior fortress is now of slight military value. 27. The territory of the Dholpur chief is about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> miles long by twenty-three broad. The town of Dholpur is nearly midway between Agra and Gwalior.

But a fourth was on its way; even as he kissed that white shoulder, he was thinking of the letter which must certainly come from Mr. Houghton in a day or two. \"What will _he_ get off?\" he asked himself; \"probably old Brad and Mrs. Newbolt have fed oats to him, so he'll kick--but what do I care?

The Indians insisted on taking their squaws with them.

On the 21st of December, Tonty and Membre set out from Fort Miami with some of the party in six canoes, and crossed to the little river Chicago.

The Dutch naval defences consisted of eight ships of the line, three <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> gun ships, eight forty-eight gun ships and eight smaller frigates, carrying in all about twelve hundred guns; but this force contributed little or nothing to the defence, and was soon forced to hoist the hostile flag.

As illustrative of this result, the British loss will be stated here. It was but 243 killed and 816 wounded in a fleet of thirty-six sail.

None is cited by French authorities. Sir Gilbert Blane, who was favourably placed for information, reckoned that of the _Ville de Paris_ alone to be 300.

Furthermore, it cost a good deal of money for any candidate to get into the House, and as members drew no pay, it cost a good deal more money to remain there. In 1906 the Liberal Party and the Labor Party gained a sweeping victory over the Conservative Party, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Liberal Prime Minister, came into power, 1906-1908. Out of the six hundred and seventy members who had been elected to the House of Commons, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> came from the ranks of the workingmen,--those to whom life means an unending struggle to live.[3] The combined Labor voters sent these men to represent them in Parliament, and then raised a fund to meet the expense of keeping them there.[4] [3] John Burns, who was one of the earliest workingmen to enter Parliament as a Labor leader, said of himself, \"Came into the world with a struggle, struggling now, with prospects of continuing it.\" [4] But later, the Court of Appeal...", "...the Prime Minister and his Cabinet are responsible solely to the House of Commons, which in its turn is responsible only to the expressed will of the majority of the nation (S587).

The vessel made the voyage in five days and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> minutes, at that time a record. Its fastest trip, made on the western voyage, was four days eleven hours forty-two minutes. This record, however, was wrested from it subsequently by the Mauretania, a sister ship, which set the mark of four days ten hours forty-one minutes, that still stands. Although the Lusitania was surpassed in size by several other liners built subsequently, it never lost the reputation acquired at the outset of its career.

One great alteration, however, was effected by a bill introduced by Lord Suffield, which abolished the practice of setting spring-guns and other engines of destruction for the preservation of game. This bill, which passed into a law, declared it to be a misdemeanour in any person to set a spring-gun, man-trap, or other engine calculated to kill, or inflict grievous injury, with the intent that it should destroy life, or occasion bodily harm to any...", "...the watching of the towns, were to be placed under the control of the town-council. The power of granting alehouse licences was also to be left to town-councils, or to a committee chosen by them from their own numbers, to grant these licences. It was proposed to divide the one hundred and eighty-three boroughs into two schedules; the greater part of these, one hundred and twenty-nine, were to be placed in schedule A, and would have a commission of the peace granted them. The remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> might also, if they chose, have a commission of the peace on application to the crown. With respect to those in schedule A, the town-councils were to have the power of recommending to the crown certain persons whom they thought proper to receive the commission of the peace within the borough; but they were not to have the power of electing magistrates in such sense as that the assent of the crown should not be necessary to perfect the election. These magistrates were not to...", "...in favour of an equal partition of property, and insisted that the system of primogeniture tended only to foster all the harsh and selfish passions of the human heart. The attorney-general opposed the motion. Mr. Ewart's arguments, he said, if they went for anything, would bring us to the system of equal distribution prevailing in France, which he could not think a desirable consummation. The change proposed would create great confusion in our law. The motion was lost by a majority of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> against thirty-three. Mr. Ewart had given notice of an address to the crown, on the appointment of a minister of education; but neither this motion nor those of Messrs. Hume, Roebuck, and Clay, noticed at the opening of this article, were brought forward this session. OPERATION OF THE NEW POOR-LAWS. From the last report of the commissioners of the poor-laws, which was made up to July, 1837, it appeared that up to that period, of 18,433 parishes or townships in...", "...Lord Lyndhurst did the excellent qualities of Lord Durham justice, and displayed a calmness in debate which contrasted strikingly with the irritability and personalities of Lord Brougham. The debate brought forcibly to light the disposition of Lord Durham to carry matters with a high hand in his new government, and his deficiency in that wariness and prudence so essential to a chief governor. After a few remarks from Lord Brougham, the bill was read a second time by a majority of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> against thirty-six. On the following day Lord Melbourne informed the house that ministers had resolved to advise the queen to disallow of the whole ordinance. It was with the deepest regret and alarm that they had taken this course; nor was it without the greatest apprehension of the consequences that they had come to this determination. His lordship then intimated his approval of the indemnity bill, and that he should in a future stage of the proceedings move a clause...", "...19th of April; but many delays took place in order that thirty-four clauses, which should have made part of the original measure, should be included. On the 4th of July, however, the house went into committee upon clause twenty, which referred to the value of the franchise. An attempt was made by Mr. Shaw to introduce a L10 qualification, which had been the ultimatum of the Conservatives in the last session: but after a short debate the original question was carried by one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> against fifty-four. Some other minor amendments were subsequently proposed, but they were negatived; and the bill was finally carried in the commons by a majority of ninety-seven against seventy-six. On the 22nd of July, the Irish Municipal Corporations bill was read a second time in the house of lords. On the 25th of July, before the house went into committee, Lord Lyndhurst gave notice of the amendments which he intended to move in the course of the evening, and of his...", "...then moved the previous question, which was carried by a majority of one hundred and eighty-two against one hundred and four. Mr. C. Villiers, according to his annual custom, on the 10th of June submitted to the house of commons a motion for the appointment of a committee of the whole house for the purpose of considering his resolutions for the abolition of all restrictions on the importation of foreign corn. On a division, the motion was negatived by a majority of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> against one hundred and thirty-two. AFFAIRS OF IRELAND--MAYNOOTH IMPROVEMENT BILL. On the 3rd of April, Sir Robert Peel brought in a measure for improving and increasing the grant to the college of Maynooth. The intention of the premier had been made known before, and a large number of petitions were on that evening presented against any such grant; in reference to which Sir Robert Peel said that he had given timely notice of his intention to consider the case of...", "...scenes of interest.

On the 28th of February the first session of the new parliament was opened by the governor-general, who delivered a speech which was intended to be concilatory, but which did not accomplish its purpose. An amendment was proposed to the address, which was carried against the government by a majority of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> to twenty. In this amendment the legislature plainly declared its want of confidence in the governor's advisers; the ministry therefore resigned. THE WEST INDIES. During this year the West India colonists were discontented, and complained of distress, while at home they were regarded with suspicion by the religious and antislavery public, as designing, if possible, to restore slavery.

The Guardian's final cable to the Conference in New Delhi shared with the friends the information that fifty of the virgin areas have been settled as of October 14th, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> more have been assigned to pioneers. The Guardian is urging every National Spiritual Assembly to get out its pledged pioneers to the still unsettled virgin areas as fast as possible.

Will you please arrange for this information to be sent to me as additional pioneers go into the field?

There is some reason to believe that there might have existed a few additional chapters. Of these <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> chapters, the first forty-one relate to the life and adventures of Prince Genji; and those which come after refer principally to one of his sons. The last ten are supposed to have been added by another hand, generally presumed to have been that of her daughter. This is conjectured because the style of these final chapters is somewhat dissimilar to that of those which precede. The period of time covered by the entire story is some sixty years, and this volume of translation...", "...Baha'i community is correspondingly accelerating.

There are, doubtless, some who come out by that road, the loss of whose society is not to be regretted. England does not choose her six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> best men. One comforts one's self, sometimes, with remembering that. The George Vavasors, the Calder Joneses, and the Botts are admitted.

Probably his most marked success was in Albany, N.Y., where he was intimately associated with Miss Emma La Jeunesse, afterwards Albani, who was his lifelong friend.

He was a man of high moral principals, singularly guileless and of a deep religious fervor.

He was physically the most splendid specimen of noble manhood my eyes ever beheld. It is said, I suppose truly, that he was but a trifle over five feet nine inches high, and weighed one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> pounds. But then, as on all other occasions that I saw him, I should have been prepared to affirm that he was over six feet high and weighed, at least, two hundred. The same glamour is said to have attended Louis XIV., whose majesty of bearing was such that it never was discovered that he was a man of short stature until he was measured for his coffin. Mr. Webster was then in the very vigor of his magnificent manhood. He stood perfectly erect.

Fifty-four, though not the same fifty-four, recommended the continuance of General Corse in the service.

Major Biddulph, who presented the head to our museum, remarked that the strength of the neck muscles must be enormous to allow of so great a weight being easily carried, and it was doubtless owing to this weight that the _Ovis Polii_ and other great sheep that he had observed had a very erect carriage, which has also been noticed by others of the _Ovis Ammon_.

As this number was too small to be handled easily in the open, we decided to take them into the corrals for the final division. After the culling back was over, and everything had started for the ranch, to oblige Sponsilier, I remained behind and helped him to retrim his remuda.

The journey was not unpleasant, most of them being persons of education and refinement, with three agreeable young ladies among them, two of them being daughters of Mr. Birkbeck, and Miss Andrews, their friend and companion. All went well and happily during the journey until Mr. Birkbeck, a widower of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> with grown daughters, made an offer of marriage to Miss Andrews, aged twenty-five. It was an embarrassing situation. She was constrained to decline the offer, and as they were traveling in such close relations, the freedom and enjoyment of the journey were seriously impaired. Then Mr. Flower, who was a widower also, but in the prime of life, proposed to the young lady. She accepted him, and they were soon after married at Vincennes, the rejected Birkbeck officiating as...", "...hulk Should sink beneath the wave; Her thunders shook the mighty deep.

The step that I then took was taken in obedience to the law, and not from any great faith in the wisdom of the Sinking Fund policy, nor was it from any fear that the Government could not pay its debts whether a Sinking Fund was or was not created. The faith of the Government had been pledged to a particular policy and I thought that the observance of that policy was both wise and just....", "...bound.

Not far distant, by the way, is the field where, in 1815, the British regulars, under Sir Edward Pakenham, received a disastrous defeat at the hands of Andrew Jackson and his American riflemen. Iberville planted his first settlement at Biloxi, {283} on Mississippi Sound. Other French posts were shortly afterward established on Cat Island, Dauphin Island, which is at the mouth of Mobile Bay, and at Mobile. A little later Bienville built a fort <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> miles above the mouth of the Great River, and he early began to insist that the future of the colony lay on its banks, not on the shores and sandy islands of the Gulf. But the time had not yet come when his ideas would prevail. The wretched colony must first go through a dismal experience of languishing, in consequence of which the seat of government was removed to Mobile, and of actual famine. At last, in 1718, Bienville, who by the death of his brother had succeeded...", "...them. I determined to surprise the rascals in the midst of their revellings.

The pilot-houses were beaten in, and three of the four pilots received mortal wounds. Despite these injuries, and the loss of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> killed and wounded, the fleet was only shaken from its hold by accidents to the steering apparatus, after which their batteries could not be brought to bear. Among the injured on this occasion was the flag-officer, who was standing by the pilot when the latter was killed.

If the reader will refer back to the first part of this narrative, he will find that I was born in the year 1786; and as I am writing this in the year 1840, I am now <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years old. I was but little more than twenty-one when I married; I have, therefore, the experience of thirty-two years of a married life; but I will not anticipate. I ended the last chapter with my own union; I must now refer to those events which followed close upon that period.

These bats, for the fixing of the principal and diagonal beams and bracing-chains, required <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> holes, each measuring a foot and a half deep, and two inches wide. The operation of boring such holes into the solid rock, was not an easy or a quick one, but by admirable arrangements on the part of the engineer, and steady perseverance on the part of the men, they progressed faster than had been anticipated. Three men were attached to each jumper, or boring chisel; one placed himself in a sitting posture, to guide the instrument, and give it a turn at each blow of the...", "...resolutions were signed on January 17, 1820.

William Findlay until the 16th of the month. The Legislature was composed of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> Democrats and twenty Whigs, and yet there was not a dissenting vote cast. Two Southern States passed resolutions,--Delaware and Kentucky: the first in favor of restriction, the last opposed to restriction.

As we contemplate the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years which made up the measure of his earthly span, we cannot fail to be impressed by its uniform consistency, its thorough conscientiousness, its devotion to high and noble objects. It is a grand thing to acquire a famous name, but it is a much grander thing to live a pure and noble life; and in estimating the character of Robert Baldwin it should be remembered that he was not merely a statesman and a lawyer, but was, over and above all else, a man and a Christian.\"[63]...", "...he would have deemed his own ministry a miserable failure in the absence of revival seasons.

The oak has resisted the current, it is a bad conductor; the beech has allowed the current to flow directly to the ground. \"So, boys, if you are in a mixed forest and stand beneath a tree, the figures show that you are <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> times as likely to be struck with lightning when standing beneath an oak, instead of a beech. Not only that, but if the oak be struck, the lightning may jump from the tree to you more surely than it would from a beech-tree. \"It's surprising,\" he went on, \"but even trees of closely related character show very different effects of lightning.

Right merrily then did the Americans boast of their \"bunch of pine boards.\" This miniature navy of the United States was about to be pitted against the greatest naval power of the world. The rolls of the navy of Great Britain bore at this time the names of over one thousand ships. Of these, no less than two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> were ships-of-the-line, mounting over seventy-four guns each. Behind this great navy were the memories of long years of conquests, of an almost undisputed supremacy upon the ocean. Small wonder was it, then, that the British laughed at the idea of the Americans giving battle to their hitherto unconquered ships. What, then, was the secret of the success which, as we shall see, attended the American arms on the sea? The answer is, that men, not ships, carried the day. Yet...", "...to close action. There were others, also, below, called sail-trimmers, to assist in working the ship, should it be necessary to shift her position during the battle.\" Thus, with her men at their quarters, her guns primed, and matches lighted, the \"Macedonian\" bore down to open the action. On the \"United States,\" very similar scenes were being enacted. In some respects, the American frigate was a more formidable ship than the adversary she was about to engage. Her battery consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> guns, and some were of heavier calibre than those of the \"Macedonian.\" Her crew, too, was rather larger than that of her adversary. But, in most respects, the ships were well matched. Indeed, the commanders of the two ships had met before the opening of the war, and, in conversation, agreed that their vessels were well fitted to test the comparative valor of Yankee and English sailors. Capt. Carden of the \"Macedonian\" had asked Decatur what would be the probable result, if...", "...thrive better than the indigenous ones, and are fit for spots where the latter make but little progress; and in another century the country may wear an aspect quite unlike that which it now presents.

When this syndicate was organized, or who constituted its members, we cannot say.

In the county of Antrim they murdered nine hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> protestants in one morning; and afterward about twelve hundred more in that county.

At the beginning the acting major general in command had been fond of boasting that he had representatives of thirty-two nations and practitioners of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> creeds and cults in his outfit. Before very long he might truthfully expand both these figures. To stopper the holes made by the wear and tear of intensive training, the attritions of sickness and of transfers, the losses by death and by wounding as suffered in the first small spells of campaigning, replacements came up from the depots, enriching the local colour of the division with new types and strange accents.

Six vessels were at that time building at Erie; and three smaller craft rested quietly in the navy-yard at Black Rock. Perry's orders included the union of these fleets, carrying <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> guns and five hundred men, and the destruction of six British vessels, carrying sixty-three guns and four hundred and fifty men. Six months of patient labour on both sides were required to put the squadrons into fighting condition; but when, on the afternoon of September 10, Perry had fought the fight to a finish, the British squadron belonged to him. The War of 1812 would be memorable for this, if it were for nothing else; and the indomitable Perry, whose stubborn courage...", "...the air was thick with suggestions.

Owing to bad weather, the expedition did not arrive amid the icebergs till the middle of June. Towering two hundred feet high, the explorers counted <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> at one time before they arrived at Resolution Island at the mouth of Hudson Strait. There were already plenty of well-known landmarks in the region of Hudson's Bay, and Parry soon made his way to Southampton Island and Frozen Strait (over which an angry discussion had taken place some hundred years before). He was rewarded by discovering \"a magnificent bay,\" to which he gave the name of the \"Duke of York's Bay.\" The discovery, however, was one of little importance as there...", "...the spot where the emeralds had been found, and, if possible, settling the question as to whether or not a mine had actually been discovered.

No jury, we knew, could convict a man on the criminal count on native evidence in a land where you can buy a murder-charge, including the corpse, all complete for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> rupees; but Biel did not care to scrape through by the benefit of a doubt. He wanted the whole thing cleared: but as he said one night:--\"He can prove anything with servants' evidence, and I've only my bare word.\" This was about a month before the case came on; and beyond agreeing with Biel, we could do little.

Take the word 'purchase' for instance, which, in ordinary use, means to acquire by giving value, but applies in law to all legal modes of obtaining property except by inheritance or descent, and in this peculiar sense the word occurs five times in Shakespeare's thirty-four plays, and only in one single instance in the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> plays of Beaumont and Fletcher. It has been suggested that it was in attendance upon the courts in London that he picked up his legal vocabulary. But this supposition not only fails to account for Shakespeare's peculiar freedom and exactness in the use of that phraseology, it does not even place him in the way of learning those terms his use of which is most remarkable, which are not such as he would have heard at ordinary proceedings at _nisi prius_, but such as refer to...", "...beyond the sphere of their profession, but in that they were loyal and admirable.

Their value was estimated at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> Scandinavian crowns each (about 3_l_.). The fishing, though tempting, is yet very uncertain; it sometimes falls out extraordinarily abundant, as in the spring of 1880, when a skipper immediately on arriving at Magdalena Bay caught 300 of these animals at a cast of the net. Of the whales thus killed not only the blubber and hide are taken away, but also, when possible, the carcases, which, when cheap freight can be had, are utilised at the guano manufactories in the north of...", "...law.

The absentees, or at least abstentions from voting, were fifteen Republicans and five Democrats, more than one-third of the body.

According to these memoranda, the vote would stand eighteen for acquittal, thirty-five for conviction--one less than the number required by the Constitution to convict.

The best is said to be that by Ko-so-gai, a priest of Tibetan descent, which was made during the early Wei dynasty, about 252 A. D. This may be the same which was read in Japan in 640 A. D. The same Sutra exists also in a Tibetan translation, for there can be little doubt that the Sutra quoted by Csoma Koeroesi (\"As.

We think justice will be done by deciding that electricity is the faster.--_N. Y. Sun_. Yet practically speaking, electricity in wires is much slower. Prof. Gould found that telegraph wires at a moderate height, transmit signals at the rate of 12,000 miles a second; but if the wires are suspended high enough, the velocity may be raised to 16,000 or even 24,000 feet a second. Subterranean wires and submarine cables transmit slowly. Wheatstone's experiments were made <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years ago, and have not since been confirmed.

It is strictly a freight canal for bringing in food-logs, and is dug out across level ground toward the standing timber.

Three other Beaver structures should be noticed. One, the dock or plunge hole, which is a deep place by a sharply raised bank, both made with careful manual labour.

In 1719 he was made a Senator; he was ennobled with the title of Marchese of Ischia and granted a yearly allowance of three thousand scudi; and his noble and generous enthusiasms, not less than his genius, have left their record on life as well as on art.

The Official Board was divided in opinion and...", "...were held annually in eastern and western cities, in which the most prominent men and women participated. The commencement of the Civil War ended all efforts for this object and its leaders devoted themselves for the next five years to the women's part of every war. In May, 1866, Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony issued a call for the scattered forces to come together in convention in New York City, and here began the movement for woman suffrage which continued without a break for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years. No large extension of the franchise had been made since the government was founded except to the working men between 1820 and 1830 and this had been accomplished by amending State constitutions. There had been no thought of enfranchising women in any other way but now Congress, for the purpose of giving the ballot to the recently freed negro men, was about to submit an amendment to the National Constitution. This convention was called to protest against \"class...", "...of Eskimos. The sun shone brilliantly the whole night, never descending below the horizon. Mackenzie sat up all night observing its course in the sky. At a quarter to four in the morning, the canoes were off again, the river winding and turning in its course but heading for the north-west. Here and there on the banks they saw traces of the Eskimos, the marks of camp fires, and the remains of huts, made of drift-wood covered with grass and willows. This day the canoes travelled <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> miles. The prospect about the travellers was gloomy and dispiriting. The low banks of the river were now almost treeless, except that here and there grew stunted willow, not more than three feet in height. The weather was cloudy and raw, with gusts of rain at intervals. The discontent of Mackenzie's companions grew apace: the guide was evidently at the end of his knowledge; while the violent rain, the biting cold {84} and the fear of an attack by hostile savages kept the...", "...but fragmentary form. It was thought needful for two to make the ascent, for the car, or basket, which held the fire hung below the open mouth of the bag, and the weight of a man on one side would disturb the perfect equilibrium which it was believed would be essential to a successful flight. The Marquis d'Arlandes in a published account of the brief flight, which sounds rather as if the two explorers of an unknown element were not free from nervousness, writes: \"Our departure was at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> minutes past one, and occasioned little stir among the spectators. Thinking they might be frightened and stand in need of encouragement I waved my arm.\" This solicitude for the fears of the spectators, standing safely on solid earth while the first aeronauts sailed skywards, is characteristically Gallic. The Marquis continues: M. de Rozier cried: \"You are doing nothing, and we are not rising.\" I stirred the fire and then began to scan the river, but...", "..._Painting by John E. Whiting._] The vessel we were in was a 500-ton cruising submarine. It had just come from eight months' guarding the Channel, and showed all the battering of eight months of a very rough and stormy career with no time for a lie-up for repairs. It was interesting to see the commander hand the depth gauge a wallop to start it working and find out if the centre of the boat was really nine feet higher than either end. We were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> feet under water and diving when the commander performed that little experiment and we continued to dive while the gauge spun around and finally stopped at a place which indicated approximately that our back was not broken.

We boarded the submarine over the tail end and balanced our way up the...", "...buzzes like a hive. Then water begins to gurgle into the ballast-tanks, and U-47 sinks until only her periscope shows. \"The steamship is a Dutchman, sir,\" calls the watch officer. The commander inspects her with the aid of a periscope. She has no wireless and is bound for the Continent. So he can come up and is glad, because moving under the water consumes electricity, and the usefulness of a submarine is measured by her electric power. After <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> hours of waking nerve tension, sleep becomes a necessity. So the ballast-tanks are filled and the nutshell sinks to the sandy bottom. This is the time for sleep aboard a submarine, because a sleeping man consumes less of the precious oxygen than one awake and busy. So a submarine man has three principal lessons to learn--to keep every faculty at tension when he is awake, to keep stern silence when he is ashore (there is a warning against...", "...her husband by death. Madam Guyon was one of that number, who, in advance of the common standard of piety, are called to be _Reformers_; and on this account, she suffered great persecutions. She was several times imprisoned. At one time eight months; and subsequently four years in one of the towers of the celebrated Bastile. After her release from prison, she was banished for the remainder of her days to Blois, on the river Loire. At the time of her release from the Bastile, she was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years of age. Her sufferings from the cold, damp walls of the prison, in winter, and the confined air in summer, with other privations and hardships, greatly impaired her constitution, and rendered her a sufferer to the close of her days. She died June 9, 1717, aged sixty-nine years. During her imprisonment, she wrote her Autobiography, which has been translated into English.

After the election of March 30, 1855, at which armed Missourians overawed the Kansas settlers and thus secured a unanimous pro-slavery Legislature, the freestate men, under the leadership of Robinson, began to import Sharp's rifles and other weapons for defense. Brown's sons thereupon wrote to their father, describing their...", "...some twenty men were killed. The recoil from this outrage was the severest blow which organized labor has received in America. John J. McNamara, Secretary of the Structural Iron Workers' Association, and his brother James were indicted for murder. After the trial was staged and the eyes of the nation were upon it, the public was shocked and the hopes of labor unionists were shattered by the confessions of the principals. In March, 1912, a Federal Grand Jury at Indianapolis returned <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> indictments against officers and members of the same union for participation in dynamite outrages that had occurred during the six years in many parts of the country, with a toll of over one hundred lives and the destruction of property valued at many millions of dollars.

The legislature of Massachusetts had reduced the hours of work of women and children from fifty-six to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> hours a week. Without making adequate announcement, the employers withheld two hours' pay from the weekly stipend.

XV At the time of Whitman's death, one of our leading literary journals charged him with having brought on premature decay by leading a riotous and debauched life. I hardly need say that there was no truth in the charge. The tremendous emotional strain of writing his \"Leaves,\" followed by his years of service in the army hospitals, where he contracted blood-poison, resulted at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> in the rupture of a small blood-vessel in the brain, which brought on partial paralysis. A sunstroke during his earlier manhood also played its part in the final break-down. That, tried by the standard of the lives of our New England poets, Whitman's life was a blameless one, I do not assert; but that it was a sane, temperate, manly one, free from excesses, free from the perversions and morbidities of a mammonish, pampered, over-stimulated age, I do believe. Indeed, I may...", "...a million or two of the most beautiful smiles in the world; and the other fairies popped down through the roof and did all the blacksmith's work for him and dropped a nice dream on his pillow just to show they had been there; and Capricious sat on the edge of the chimney-pot, until the sun came above the horizon and it was time for her to take the Queen's message to Wympland.

The Queen was as pleased to see him as if he had never been naughty at all; but, of course, she was far too much of a Queen to let him guess that he was really there to be scolded. So she made him sit next to her at breakfast, and gave him a cup of stinging-nettle tea to keep him awake, and allowed him to make as...", "...the Lady Emmelina, he had no one to play with. He had never been left so much to himself in his life, and in spite of his excellent opinion of himself he found himself extremely dull.

To be sure, he had five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> birthday presents; but what consolation could they afford him when he was still without a steamboat that went by real steam? The Lady Emmelina was the cause of all his misfortunes, and he could not bear the Lady Emmelina. It was the Lady Emmelina who had come in the place of his real steamboat and his real cannon and his real balloon; it was the Lady Emmelina who had bewitched the little Princess, his sister, and robbed him of his best playfellow. And the Prince...", "...own fault, and I don't care a bit,\" he said, impatiently; and he rolled the large white stone over the hole, until the doll from Fairyland was completely hidden. It is a wonder the fairies did not interfere; but perhaps they had their reasons.

It was in vain that the Prince offered to give her his five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> birthday presents if she would only stop crying: the Princess wanted her doll from Fairyland, and nothing but her doll from Fairyland would console her. Every one who loved the little Princess--and that was every one in the palace--began looking for the Lady Emmelina; but no one succeeded in finding a trace of her. This, however, was by no means so surprising as it sounds, for the large white stone was no longer in the middle of the lawn, and the neat round hole lined with...", "...will surely prove a stormy scene.

Differences of this type are small _fluctuations_ in any and every character, centering about an average or mean, which is itself fairly definite and fixed--less subject to variation in different groups or through successive generations. For example, if we measure by inches the stature of a thousand or more persons chosen at random we find that they may vary from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> to seventy-six inches; the most frequent heights might be about sixty-nine and sixty-four inches among the men and women respectively.

The measurement of almost any characteristic in a large group of any organisms usually gives a result of the kind figured.

The main hope of success on the English side lay in the idea that the spirit and acts of resistance to the authority of the mother-country were in reality only on the part of a turbulent minority; that the bulk of the people desired to be loyal.

On this basis the estimated annual rate of growth was 1.3 percent, exceeded in Europe only by that of Albania. Density of the population was 224 persons per square mile.

The 1971 growth rate, however, may not be maintained. Legislation enacted in 1966 stringently restricted abortions and discouraged birth control practices, resulting in an increased birth rate for the next few years, but by 1971 there were indications that the rate was again declining.

The population group with ages from fifty to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> had both a low overall figure and an abnormally low percentage of males (see table 1). The low total reflected a low birth rate during World War I years; the abnormal sex distribution reflected World War II combat losses.

The moral miasma rising from that sink of iniquity, the late court of Louis XIV., and, infinitely more, that of Louis XV., enveloped Germany. Every little German court imagined itself a Versailles.

The pen refuses to record the history of the incest practised at that court with and among the three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> \"natural\" children of August. August was jealous of the Crown Prince of Prussia, and therefore substituted for Countess Orzelska the beautiful Italian Formera, who became Frederick's first mistress.

Different nations had \"planted bottles\" and \"taken possession\" wherever their explorers had chanced to land, frequently ignoring the same ceremony on the part of previous explorers; but these formalities did not weigh against the rights of discovery and actual occupation by Russia--else Spain's rights would have been prior to Great Britain's.

They traded dried fish, furs, and ornaments of their own making for knives and old iron; and two, at least, boarded the ship.

Searching through the numberless portraits that line the picture-gallery, you will hardly find a dozen where the personal beauty for which the Vavasours have long been proverbial is more strikingly exemplified than in their present representative. There are lines of silver--not unfrequent--in the abundant chestnut hair and bushy whiskers; but <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years have not traced ten wrinkles on the high white forehead, nor filled the outline of the well-cut aquiline features, nor altered the clearness of the healthy, bright complexion, nor dimmed the pleasant light of the large frank blue eyes.

In his employ, he afterwards became mate of a ship; in which station having continued some time, he had the offer of being master, which he refused, as it seems he had at that time turned his thoughts towards the navy. Accordingly, at the breaking out of the war in 1755, he entered on board the \"Eagle,\" of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> guns, and in a short time after, Sir Hugh Palliser was appointed to the command of that ship, a circumstance that must not be passed unnoticed, as it proved the foundation of the future fame and fortune of Captain Cook.

In 1831, he was elected as one of the Representatives to Congress from Massachusetts, and continued there till his death, the first President that ever sat in an American Congress. It will be <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years the thirtieth of next May, since he began his public career. What did he aim at in that long period? At first sight, it is easy to see the aim of some of the conspicuous men of America. It has obviously been the aim of Mr. Clay to build up the \"American System,\" by the establishment of protective duties; that of Mr. Calhoun to establish free trade, leaving a man to buy where he can buy cheapest, and sell where he can sell dearest. In respect to these matters the two...", "...in detail. It was soon made plain that the attack of the morning had been not much more than a beginning of the Indian attempt to overwhelm Jackson. Half an hour after Coffee returned the Creeks renewed the battle. A considerable force began the action by making an assault upon Jackson's right flank. As soon as their line was developed Coffee asked permission to turn their left flank--moving from the rear of Jackson's right--with two hundred men. Through some misunderstanding only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> men accompanied Coffee, but that particularly enterprising officer, not to be balked of his purpose or delayed in executing it, dashed on though the woods with his little force, which consisted chiefly of his own officer company, and fell upon the flank of the savages fiercely.

The city council consists of eighteen aldermen and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> councillors, selected from eighteen wards; it is divided into seventeen committees, most of which consist of eight members.

In the forest this may be no more than ten feet in girth, but in isolated specimens may be as much as <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> feet (Cowthorpe Oak), with a much broader base. The thick rough bark is deeply furrowed in a large network pattern, which affords temporary hiding-places for insects. The branches are much given to turn and zig-zag from side to side--a character that makes them very useful in boat-building, as \"knees\" of various angles may be cut from them without having recourse to bending.

He had failed in his attempts to form an alliance with the aristocracy through his increasing wealth by the marriage of his daughter. Yet had he carried his point, such a marriage could scarcely have been attended with greater _eclat_ than on the present occasion.

In sober moments even the most ardent liberals were ashamed, feeling that this was not an opportune moment for disorganizing such administration as there was by calls for the reform of the constitution.

The general public was so outraged by the spectacle that the deputies reconsidered their action, and by a vote of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> to two hundred and twenty-three struck out the obnoxious clause. But this did not appease Napoleon, who made no attempt to conceal his rage, and prorogued the chamber in scorn.

During the early days of his pottery making, about five years after his apprenticeship had expired, Wedgwood became associated with Thomas Whieldon, a potter who had attained considerable success in the manufacture of combed and agate wares, and the period of their partnership, which ended in 1759, was of benefit to both.

Young, indeed! he was only a lad, just fifteen, a fine-hearted, sprightly young fellow, and he was going off to...", "...of a book on travels in Spain.[2] But he came in no conciliatory mood, and the foment was kept up. The Northwest Company tried to starve the colonists, and Governor Semple destroyed the enemy's fort below Fort Garry. Then came the end--a decisive battle and massacre. Sixty-five men on horses, and with some carts, were sent by Alexander McDonnell, of the Northwest Company, up the river towards the colony. They were led by Cuthbert Grant, and included six Canadians, four Indians, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> half-breeds. It was afterwards said they went on innocent business, but every man was armed, and the \"breeds\" were naked, and painted all over to look like Indians. They got their paint of the Northwest officers. Moreover, there had been rumors that the colonists were to be driven away, and that \"the land was to be drenched with blood.\" It was on June 19, 1816, that runners notified the colony that the others were coming. Semple was at Fort Douglas, near Fort Garry. When...", "...to a witch (or medicine woman) to be cured of an accidental burn by charms and incantations.

I presume it was in consequence of these new arrivals that we had a grand _talk_ or council after breakfast this morning, at which I was permitted to be present, or, as the French say, to _assist_. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> of their chiefs, or rather chief men, present, and not less that two hundred Indians round the house, their dark eager faces filling up the windows and doorways; but they were silent, quiet, and none but those first admitted attempted to enter.

We have been told by Mr. James Beaty that when out duck shooting, now nearly forty years since, he was surprised by falling in with Mr. Worts, senior, rambling apparently without purpose in the bush at the mouth of the Little Don: all the surrounding locality was then in a state of nature, and frequented only by the sportsman or trapper.

But, there remained only three gallons in all! The doctor put aside one gallon, destined to quench the burning thirst that a heat of ninety degrees rendered intolerable. Two gallons only then remained to supply the cylinder. Hence, they could produce no more than four hundred and eighty cubic feet of gas; yet the cylinder consumed about nine cubic feet per hour. Consequently, they could not keep on longer than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> hours--and all this was a mathematical calculation! \"Fifty-four hours!\" said the doctor to his companions. \"Therefore, as I am determined not to travel by night, for fear of passing some stream or pool, we have but three days and a half of journeying during which we must find water, at all hazards.

A line of railroad from Pretoria to Vereeniging on the Vaal River, passing through Johannesburg, is now open. At Vereeniging it is connected with the Great Trunk line through the Orange Free State, which branches off to the three chief ports of Cape Colony. From Krugersdorp there is a railway through Johannesburg to the Springs. This passes over a great coal mine, which supplies fuel to the city itself and to the quartz-crushing machinery along a route of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> miles. With railroads at its command, the South African Republic must needs have a brilliant future. It is rather a curious fact in the history of the country, that as soon as the unbeaten tracks were opened to civilization and cultivation they became freed from malarial fevers. This was particularly noticeable along the borders of the forests and the streams in the lowlands. In course of time vast tracts north of the Vaal became the property of the emigrant farmers, who...", ".... . 1845. _Small 8vo, green calf, gilt back and edges._ The illustrations to this book are in proof state, and in addition are inserted Gosden's facsimile-title to the first edition of Walton's Angler, the frontispieces (proofs) to Pickering's miniature edition of Walton, portraits of Walton and Cotton from the Pickering edition of 1836, and other plates of Fish, etc., from various editions of the Complete Angler, with the Milkmaid's Song and other extracts in manuscript, ornamented, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> plates in all.

Finally, along the Nile and the canals they set up a multitude of simple but practical hydraulic works; through the aid of these they raised water and poured it out upon the fields; these machines were placed one or two stories higher than the water.

For twelve years the amount of cloud at each hour of the day has been recorded at Blue Hill. The personal observations have been supplemented during the day-time by an automatic instrument called a sunshine-recorder, for it has been proved that the cloudiness is very nearly the inverse of the bright sunshine. Consequently, if, as is usual there, the sun shines forty-six per cent. of the time when it is above the horizon, the cloudiness is very nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> per cent., which is the average for the year. The instrument generally used for this purpose is a glass sphere which acts as a burning-glass, and chars a strip of cardboard placed concentrically around the lower part of the sphere.

The tide of immigration which set in brought the Scotch-Irish to every colony.

When over five hundred arrived at Boston in the summer of 1718, a shortage of provisions threatened. To place the immigrants on a self-supporting basis was highly desirable. In addition the more remote settlements needed protection. The plan was accordingly adopted of sending the Scotch-Irish to the frontier. About fifty miles from Boston was the post of...", "...John Rainoldes urged the necessity of providing for his people a uniform translation of the Bible. Rainoldes was the leader of the Puritans, a person of prodigious reading and doctrine, and the very treasury of erudition.

There was a \"careful selection of revisers made by some unknown but very competent authority.\" The translators were divided into six bands of nine each, and the work of translation was apportioned out to them. A set of rules was drawn up for their guidance, which has happily come down to modern times--almost the only record that remains of this great undertaking.

If any point was found to be very obscure, letters were to be addressed, by authority, to learned persons throughout the land inviting their judgment. The work was commenced in 1604.

During his illness his colleagues met in his bedroom so that they might retain the benefit of his learning. Only forty-seven out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> names are known. When the companies had completed their work, one complete copy was made at Oxford, one at Cambridge, and one at Westminster. Those were sent to London.

English watches, by this economical system of production, keep their place against the competition of foreign watches; of which we imported, in 1853, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> thousand. The skilled workmen, in all the various subdivisions of the manufacture, are well paid, and take their due rank amongst the great and increasing body of intelligent mechanics. Within these few years American clocks have been extensively sold in this country. People would once have thought that the business of clockmaking in England would be at an end, if it had been predicted that in 1853 we should import, as we did, a hundred and forty thousand clocks.

Was it out of respect for the high authority of this saint that the Holy Ghost confirmed his selection, at the Council of Nice, about 175 years afterwards?

At the very moment when France was bleeding from a thousand wounds, the International, taking advantage of the circumstances, and aided by 150,000 of the National Guard, took possession of Paris and ruled the city with a high hand.

On the 26th a species of election was held which surrendered the destinies of the Capital to the Commune. It numbered among its members <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> Jacobins, Blanquists and Hebertists, out of a total of seventy-nine. It was an assembly of Internationalists indeed.

Some trembled as they passed through the door, and, once outside the room, gave vent to their sorrow in groans and shrieks, while others, in the excess of their grief, cursed God, as though Lincoln's death was an unjust punishment of him instead of a glorious crown of martyrdom. Looking back through <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years--after the calm judgment of sages has reasserted their wisdom and after all Lincoln's enemies have turned to devoted friends--we cannot forbear the renewed assertion that Abraham Lincoln was in some special way unlike other men.

In fact, when the Senatorial election took place in the Legislature, Douglas received <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> and Lincoln forty-six votes--one of the results of the lamentable apportionment law then in operation.* * Horace Greeley was one of the most vigilant men during the debate.

The date of Giulio's birth is a little uncertain. Vasari (who knew him personally) speaks of him as <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years old at the date of his death, 1st November 1546; thus he would have been born in 1492.

The rear or driving-wheels were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> inches in diameter on a crank-axle placed in front of the fire-box. The cranks were thirty-nine inches from centre to centre. The front wheels, which were simply carrying wheels, were forty-five inches in diameter, on an axle placed just back of the cylinders. The cylinders were nine and one-half inches in diameter by eighteen inches stroke, and were attached horizontally to the outside of the smoke-box, which was D-shaped, with the sides receding inwardly, so as to bring...", "...thirty thousand pounds, of which eleven thousand seven hundred and seventy-five pounds were on the drivers, and eighteen thousand three hundred and thirty-five on the truck.

This machine of course came in competition with the eight-wheeled engine having four drivers, and Mr. Baldwin claimed for his plan a decided superiority. In each case about two-thirds of the total weight was carried on the four drivers, and Mr. Baldwin maintained that his engine, having only six instead of eight wheels, was simpler and more effective.

This attack was to have, beside its own field artillery, the support of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> heavy guns, and the Russian left wing on the Balaklava battleground was to keep Bosquet occupied. If successful, the attack on the ridge was to be the signal for a general attack all along the line.

Two miles to the north is a hill between nine hundred and a thousand feet higher than that of Samaria, while to the southeast other hills lead up to the rocky heights of Mount Ebal, over three thousand feet above the sea-level.

Taking the prices at which the work was latterly actually executed, 8,000_l._ per mile would be a liberal allowance for our future proceeding, even adopting the same system; and with a modified system, such as that suggested of simple longitudinal bearers of large scantling, and a rail of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> pounds per yard, at the present high price of iron, the cost, calculated upon our actual past expenditure, would not exceed 7,400_l._ per mile. This, I am aware, is a larger sum than that which has usually been assumed as the cost of the permanent way. I cannot prove that others have cost more, or even so much as this, as I have nothing but the published accounts to refer to; but this I can state, and prove if necessary, that rails and blocks, such as are now being adopted...", "...periods of the Revolution, the Directory, the Consulate and the Empire are only introduced when found necessary to explain the rapidly advancing steps of this wonderful character in history, the worshiped idol of an entire nation, that his military career may be the better understood; hence it has been thought advisable to refer briefly, at times, to the relations of France with other countries, and the cause of his spending, during the ten years of his reign as Emperor, exactly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> days less in camp, and under the enemy's fire, so to speak, than he did in his royal residences!

There is not sufficient evidence to give any degree of certainty to either of these conjectural restorations. The interior of the building, according to the latest discoveries, consists of a large central rectangular chamber (thirty-six by thirty feet wide and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> feet high), approached by an ascending spiral corridor, leading from a lower chamber which communicated immediately with the principal entrance. The entrance was a high arch in the cylindrical tower immediately opposite the bridge; it is now walled up and the lower chamber into which it leads can only be approached from above. In the central chamber there are four niches in which formerly stood the urns and tombstones of the illustrious persons buried here. A large...", "...of a theatre. The temple is generally supposed to have been that of Juno alluded to by Virgil. The form of this temple was almost identical with that at Aricia. The interior of the cella was twenty-seven feet wide and forty-five feet long. It had columns of the Doric order in front and at the sides, but none at the back. The walls of the chamber at the back were here, as at Aricia, prolonged on each side, so as to close the side porticoes at the back. The surrounding area was about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> feet in breadth at the sides, but in front a space of only eight feet was left open, in consequence of the position of the theatre, which abutted closely upon the temple. On the eastern side of the cella are traces of the rooms where the priests in charge of the temple lived. The shape of the forum can only be partially made out.

The Mexican loss was one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> officers and men killed; two hundred and five wounded; missing, one hundred and fifty-six.

The limits of the Russian territory, in this region, are bounded on the south by the parallel of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> degrees and forty minutes north latitude; but though the Muscovite power lays claim to the territory, and about fifty thousand Indians acknowledge his authority, the sovereignty is little more than a name.

The Ministerials have not even the courage to do evil logically and consistently, with equal injustice to all. Two years ago Waldeck Rousseau, in his famous political speech at Toulouse, declared religious vows to be contrary to public law; and in the same breath he introduced the law of 1901, inviting all Congregations to apply for authorization. His colleague, M. Brisson, at the session in which <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> Congregations of men were executed _in globo_, loftily declared \"that the Republic would never put its signature to an act alienating human liberty.\" And at that very moment, three or four of these Congregations were nestling, securely, under the protecting wing of M.

This fleet consisted of twenty-two ships of war, from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> to sixty-four guns each, besides six frigates, two bomb-ketches, and two fire-ships. The troops that were sent on this expedition, made a descent on the little island of Kotin; but a Russian colonel, named Tolbogwin, who commanded a regiment there, ordered his soldiers to lie down flat on their bellies, while the Swedes were coming on shore, and then suddenly rising up, they threw in so brisk and well directed a fire, that the Swedes were put into confusion, and forced to...", "...negotiations, which elsewhere are wont to take up so much time, goes and joins his army, then before Riga, the capital of Livonia; he began by bombarding the place (Nov. 21.), and fired off the three first bombs himself; then changed the siege into a blockade; and, when well assured that Riga could not escape him, he repaired to his city of Petersburg, to inspect and forward the works carrying on there, the new buildings, and finishing of his fleet; and having laid the keel of a ship of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> guns, (Dec. 3.) with his own hands, he returned to Moscow.

These eighteen thousand four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> men were cooped up on less than thirteen acres of ground, making about fifteen hundred to the acre.

At the peace of Utrecht (1713) the marines were disbanded, but reappeared in 1739 as part of the army; and in 1740 three regiments of marines were raised in America, the colonels being appointed by the crown, the captains by the provinces. In 1747 the marine regiments were transferred from the control of the secretary at war to that of the admiralty, and the next year once more wholly disappeared on the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748). During the preceding period of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years the marine force appeared and disappeared with war. It was a military body, applied to naval purposes. Its main functions were three-fold--(1) for fighting in ships; (2) for seizing and holding land positions necessary or advantageous to the naval operations of war; (3) for maintaining discipline of the ships, and by \"expertness in handling arms to incite our seamen to the imitation of them.\" Incidentally the force came to be regarded as so good a feeder for the navy...", "...armies operating in concert.

The coincidence of the name for month with the name for moon in the various Aryan languages(744) points to the conclusion that the year of our remote ancestors was primarily based on observation of the moon rather than of the sun; but as a year of twelve lunar months or three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> days (reckoning the months at twenty-nine and thirty days alternately) falls short of the solar year of three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days by roundly twelve days, the discrepancy could not fail to attract the attention of an intelligent people, such as the primitive Aryans must be supposed to have been, who had made some progress in the arts of life; and the most obvious way of removing the discrepancy and equating the lunar with the solar year is to add twelve...", "...or months have been so considered by the primitive astronomers who first observed the discrepancy between solar and lunar time and attempted to reconcile it by the expedient of intercalation. (M265) Thus we infer with some probability that the sacred Twelve Days or Nights at midwinter derive their peculiar character in popular custom and superstition from the circumstance that they were originally an intercalary period inserted annually at the end of a lunar year of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> days for the purpose of equating it to a solar year reckoned at three hundred and sixty-six days. However, there are grounds for thinking that at a very early time the Aryan peoples sought to correct their lunar year, not by inserting twelve supplementary days every year, but by allowing the annual deficiency to accumulate for several years and then supplying it by a whole intercalary month.

A commission of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> professors, masters, and doctors was then appointed to examine all the proposed ways and means. After mature deliberation this commission proposed three possible ways of ending the schism and drew them up in writing and forwarded them to the king.

We give only three brief extracts from it, to show the three ways which they proposed. The first way....", "...gods ghastly sacrifices. Sec. 2.

Instead of opposing the crossing of the Rhine by the Prussians, which, with so large a force, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> pieces of well-served artillery, he might easily have done, the Prince of Prussia, with a division of fifteen thousand men, was allowed to obtain a secure footing in his rear, almost unopposed.

Although the symptoms of irritant poisoning were very clearly marked, the country practitioner, who attended the woman at the time, certified that the cause of her death was gastro-enteritis. Eleven weeks after she had been buried, the body was exhumed and examined. An analysis revealed the presence of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> grains of arsenic in the stomach alone. The possession of a considerable quantity of arsenic was brought home to the accused, and also direct evidence of its administration, and she was found guilty.

Whether this pace was really intended to be always maintained may perhaps be doubtful. Probably it depended a good deal on the amount of racing with the \"Nimrod,\" but of this more will be heard presently. For the present, however, we will retrace our steps for a few years, and take a journey or two with the \"Tally-hoes,\" and go more into particulars than has yet been the case.

And this having been the first coach which attempted to cover so long a journey in one day, it marks with sufficient accuracy the time during which coaching was at its zenith. Of course, there were many fast and good coaches running after this date; but subsequent to the year 1842, most of the roads, taking their start from the Metropolis, were, more or less, pressed upon by railways, and the...", "...ground and broke up the surface sufficiently to get a good hold on it.

In severe weather this was naturally very trying, consequently, they did not work every day. For instance, the \"Wonder,\" from Shrewsbury to London, a distance of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> miles, had three guards, each of whom worked two double journeys and then rested for one. The object of these men going the whole journey no doubt was that there should be no break in the parcel department, which might have caused delay or loss.

Careful plumbing of the abutments revealed the fact that three out of four abutment pilasters were out of the vertical, as shown in Figs. 52 and 53, the greatest amount being 5/8 inch in 6 feet--at that corner from which the cracked rib had its springing; there was also other evidence of settlement in an old crack extending from the top of the abutment to the ground level, although this movement was very old, certainly as to the greater part.

This must be attributed to the fact that the testicles of drunkards become to a great extent atrophied. The condition is shown in Figure C 89 by R. Weichselbaum,[B] representing a section through the testicle of a drunkard. Figure C 90 which shows a section through a normal testicle, enables even the layman to observe the atrophy of the characteristic glandular tissue of the testicle. Weichselbaum has up to now found that in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> cases, without exception, in which alcoholism had been proved, this atrophy could be demonstrated to a greater or less degree. In thirty of these cases the subject was so young that senile atrophy was out of the question. The abuse of alcohol is not the only harmful influence which is able to induce such atrophy of the testicles, but chronic alcoholism acts with special intensity.

After having well cleared the part that was cut, we observed carefully in spring the growth of the young buds; the renewed tops on the 20th of April, had sensibly shot out in the parts exposed to the south, and which consequently were sheltered...", "...the Southern States gave Whig majorities; but when that party died, because of its coquetting with slavery, and the Republican party took its place, the leading principle of which new party was opposition to slavery, first, as to its extension, and then as to its continuance, nearly the whole vote of the South became Democratic. This was very plainly shown in the vote cast for Franklin Pierce and Winfield Scott (the last Whig candidate), in 1852, when the former received two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> electoral votes and the latter only forty-two. Indeed, it was this fact, and the great preponderance of Democratic votes at that election, that gave to the Secessionists of the South, and their sympathizers, aiders, and abettors of the North, the encouragement which caused them to inaugurate a rebellion in 1860. It was this, together with the fact that out of the thirty-two preceding years--from the election of Jackson in 1828 to that of Lincoln in 1860--the Democrats had...", "...take thirty seconds, and some of them require four to five minutes or even longer before they make up their minds to coil.

Accordingly, Diana Vaughan issued an invitation to a conference to be held on April 19, 1897, in the great hall of the Geographical Society of Paris. It was also stated that other conferences would be held in the principal cities of France, Italy, England, and the United States. The programme for the evening was quite elaborate, beginning with a lottery for an American typewriter and ending with a series of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> stereopticon pictures representing, among other fantastic scenes, Sophia Walder and her serpents, events in the life of Diana Vaughan, the apparition of the devil Bitru in Rome, Eden and Eve with the fatal apple, sacrilegious stabbing of the host on a Satanic altar in a Masonic lodge at Berlin, and finally Leo XIII with the encyclical letter _Humanum genus_ as a flaming sword in his hand, the archangel Michael on his right and the apocalyptic St. John on his left treading...", "...we wish to investigate the longevity of American lawyers. Now to be a lawyer in name only requires the candidate to have lived twenty-one years, and the average number of years which the average person of twenty-one years of age will continue to live is about forty; so that the mere fact that a man is a lawyer would bring his average age at death up to sixty-one years. I find in Mulhall's Dictionary of Statistics the statement made that the lawyers of Frankfurt die at the average age of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years, while merchants live to be fifty-seven years old. I know nothing about the authority of these figures, and am using them for illustration only. Assuming all the data to be correct (and twenty-one seems not too high an age for this purpose), this would seem to suggest that the ordinary lawyer of Frankfurt is not favored with abundance of years. In passing, it is interesting to note that these Frankfurt statistics of lawyers and merchants and other classes show a...", "...and 1909. Since the latter date, the progress of these quarters has been arrested in turn, and the recent growth is mainly in the remote working-class suburbs in the south and on the bank of the Riachuelo. Buenos Aires has preserved in its central district, and reproduces in all its outer districts, the primitive draught-board plan of a Spanish colonial city. This plan is not suited to its needs to-day. The rapid growth of the city and its expansion--the mean density is not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> inhabitants to the hectare, as against 360 at Paris--complicate the problem of transport. At the present time the city is considering plans for reconstructing its thoroughfares and making diagonal streets, starting from the centre and following the direction of the main streams of traffic. In this way the city would reproduce the fan-wise distribution of railways over the Pampean plain. Buenos Aires is the intermediary between the provinces and oversea countries.

[Cause of German Success.] The main cause of the disparity of France and Germany in 1870 was in truth that Prussia had had from 1862 to 1866 a Government so strong as to be able to force upon its subjects its own gigantic scheme of military organisation in defiance of the votes of Parliament and of the national will. In 1866 Prussia, with a population of nineteen millions, brought actually into the field three hundred and fifty thousand men, or one in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> of its inhabitants. There was no other government in Europe, with the possible exception of Russia, which could have imposed upon its subjects, without risking its own existence, so vast a burden of military service as that implied in this strength of the fighting army.

The Prince in his haste snatched it up so quickly that it went out, and it took him a long time to light it again with two little bits of glowing charcoal which he had to dig out from the pile of ashes upon the hearth. However, at last the peas were gathered and shelled, and the fire lighted, but then they had to be carefully counted, since the old woman declared that she would cook fifty-four, and no more. In vain did the Prince represent to her that he was famished--that <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> peas would go no way towards satisfying his hunger--that a few peas, more or less, surely could not matter. It was quite useless, in the end he had to count out the fifty-four, and worse than that, because he dropped one or two in his hurry, he had to begin again from the very first, to be sure the number was complete. As soon as they were cooked the old dame took a pair of scales and a morsel of bread from the cupboard, and was just about to divide it when Prince Vivien,...", "...whilst several of the ships in the fleet lost as much as five degrees!

BUENOS AYRES IN 1889. In the year 1889, after five weeks of ocean tossing, the steamer on which I was a passenger anchored in the River Plate, off Buenos Ayres. Nothing but water and sky was to be seen, for the coast was yet twenty miles away, but the river was too shallow for...", "...the inevitable _cigarillo_. A few looked up at the gilded keys of St. Peter adorning the front of the cathedral, perhaps wondering if they would be used to admit them to a better world. Next day, as I sallied forth to the dismal duty of caring for the dead and dying, the guns of the Argentine fleet [Footnote: British-built vessels of the latest and most approved types.] in the river opposite the city blazed forth upon the quarter held by the Government's loyal troops. One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> shots were fired, two of the largest gunboats firing three-hundred and six-hundred pounders. Soon every square was a shambles, and the mud oozed with blood. The Buenos Ayres _Standard_, describing that day of fierce warfare, stated: \"At dawn, the National troops, quartered in the Plaza Libertad, made another desperate attack on the Revolutionary positions in the Plaza Lavalle. The Krupp guns, mitrailleuses and gatlings went off at a terrible rate, and volleys succeeded...", "...children to work in coal-mines, they should surely provide some other way to feed the children.

Out of a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years we have the history of about forty. The style of Tacitus is, perhaps, noted principally for its conciseness. Tacitean brevity is proverbial, and many of his sentences are so brief, and leave so much for the student to read between the lines, that in order to be understood and appreciated the author must be read over and over again, lest the reader miss the point of some of his most excellent thoughts. Such an author presents grave, if not insuperable, difficulties...", "...wait patient until a machine came along. Then it would warm your heart to see the enthusiasm of them.

Twenty-eight is the usual close of the active season for getting rid of one's fellow-creatures; a prize-fighter falls off after that age. I take it that Macbeth was about twenty-eight when he murdered Duncan, and from about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> to sixty when he began to whine about missing the comforts of old age.

At nine o'clock, there being little wind, and what there was being variable, the Endeavour was carried by the tide or current within two cables' length of the north-west shore where she had <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> fathom water. By the help, of the boats she was gotten clear; and about two, our people anchored in a very safe and convenient cove. Soon after, Mr. Cook, with most of the gentlemen, landed upon the coast, where they found a fine stream of excellent water, and wood in the greatest plenty. Indeed the land, in this part of the country, was one forest, of vast extent.

The land in which this bay lies, was at first judged by our navigators to be part of a great continent. But, upon coasting round the whole country, it was proved to a demonstration that it was only an island of seventy leagues in circuit. In honour of his majesty, Captain Cook called it the Isle of Georgia. It could scarcely have been thought, that an island of no greater extent than this, situated between the latitude of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> and fifty-five, should, in a manner, be wholly covered, many fathoms deep, with frozen snow, in the height of summer. The sides and summits of the lofty mountains were cased with snow and ice; and an incredible quantity lay in the valleys. So immense was the quantity that our commander did not think that it could be the produce of the island. Some land, therefore, which he had seen at a distance, induced him to believe, that it might belong to an extensive tract, and gave...", "...I heard? I am struck mute with shock! Argon And I!

Ten hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> men, or nearly half their number, were killed and wounded, among whom were 83 officers. In few battles ever fought was the proportion of casualties to the number engaged so great. The Americans fought bravely, but the extraordinary praise bestowed upon them for their valor appears misplaced. Their position was one of great strength, and the absence of drill was of no consequence whatever in such an engagement. They were perfectly sheltered from the enemy's fire while engaged...", "...King. \"She's got a smile like an earthquake! Flossy Flouncy, here, she won't count half as much!\" Marjorie only laughed at King's comment, and spread her rosy lips in a desperate effort to beat the record. At last all were measured, and taking a pair of scissors, Miss Hart clipped the ends off the papers where the mark was, and thus each paper represented the exact width of a smile. The papers of each side were then placed end to end, and the whole length measured. The result was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> inches of smile for Flip's side, and fifty-two for Gladys'. \"Hooray, Mopsy!\" cried King. \"I knew your mouth was two inches bigger than Delight's!\" \"Oh, no, brother,\" rejoined Midge, \"it's because your mouth is so tiny you can't smile very well!\" But whatever the reason, there was a good two inches difference in the aggregate, so Flip Henderson's side was the winner. \"As all the Chessy Cats grinned nobly, you must all have prizes,\" said Mr. Maynard, and so to the...", "...to say, in twenty-seven and one-third days. The motion of rotation is that which produces day and night on the surface of the moon; save that there is only one day and one night in the lunar month, each lasting three hundred and fifty-four and one-third hours.

As to the other face, always invisible to us, it has of necessity three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> hours of absolute night, tempered only by that \"pale glimmer which falls upon it from the stars.\" Some well-intentioned, but rather obstinate persons, could not at first comprehend how, if the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth during her revolution, she can describe one turn round herself. To such they answered, \"Go into your dining-room, and walk round the table in such a way as to always keep your face turned toward the center; by the time you will...", "...in Florida.\" \"But then J.

That was a danger we had not provided for.\" \"I feared it,\" said Nicholl simply. \"And you never mentioned it, my sublime captain,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, clasping his friend's hand. Barbicane now began to settle himself in the projectile as if he was never to leave it. One must remember that this aerial car had a base with a _superficies_ of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> square feet. Its height to the roof was twelve feet. Carefully laid out in the inside, and little encumbered by instruments and traveling utensils, which each had their particular place, it left the three travelers a certain freedom of movement. The thick window inserted in the bottom could bear any amount of weight, and Barbicane and his companions walked upon it as if it were solid plank; but the sun striking it directly with its rays lit the interior of the projectile...", "...without gradation of light, without attenuation of the luminous waves, that the orb seemed to have been extinguished by a powerful blow. \"Melted, disappeared!\" Michel Ardan exclaimed, aghast. Indeed, there was neither reflection nor shadow. Nothing more was to be seen of that disc, formerly so dazzling. The darkness was complete. and rendered even more so by the rays from the stars. It was \"that blackness\" in which the lunar nights are insteeped, which last three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> hours and a half at each point of the disc, a long night resulting from the equality of the translatory and rotary movements of the moon. The projectile, immerged in the conical shadow of the satellite, experienced the action of the solar rays no more than any of its invisible points. In the interior, the obscurity was complete. They could not see each other. Hence the necessity of dispelling the darkness. However desirous Barbicane might be to husband the gas, the...", "...fair to build ourselves up a little.\" This proposal meeting with no contradiction, Michel prepared the repast in a few minutes. But they ate for eating's sake, they drank without toasts, without hurrahs. The bold travelers being borne away into gloomy space, without their accustomed _cortege_ of rays, felt a vague uneasiness in their hearts. The \"strange\" shadow so dear to Victor Hugo's pen bound them on all sides. But they talked over the interminable night of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> hours and a half, nearly fifteen days, which the law of physics has imposed on the inhabitants of the moon. Barbicane gave his friends some explanation of the causes and the consequences of this curious phenomenon. \"Curious indeed,\" said they; \"for, if each hemisphere of the moon is deprived of solar light for fifteen days, that above which we now float does not even enjoy during its long night any view of the earth so beautifully lit up. In a word she has no moon...", "...began to vomit death into the fated ten thousand.

A full fourth part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment; the three-fourths reached it and plunged over--to death by drowning. Within ten short minutes after we had opened fire, armed resistance was totally annihilated, the campaign was ended, we <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> were masters of England. Twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us. But how treacherous is fortune! In a little while--say an hour --happened a thing, by my own fault, which--but I have no heart to write that.

Mathew Kearney himself was a man of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> or fifty-six; hale, handsome, and powerful; his snow-white hair and bright complexion, with his full grey eyes and regular teeth giving him an air of genial cordiality at first sight which was fully confirmed by further acquaintance.

That country was computed to contain, in the last century, five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> cities, sixty thousand villages, and about forty millions of souls. If we compare the administration of the house of Sassan with that of the house of Sefi, the political influence of the Magian with that of the Mahometan religion, we shall probably infer, that the kingdom of Artaxerxes contained at least as great a number of cities, villages, and inhabitants.

As soon as the legions gave way, the lighter and more active squadrons of the second line rode sword in hand into the intervals, and completed the disorder.

The number of the slain was computed at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> thousand men, and the slaughter of the conquerors was more considerable than that of the vanquished; a circumstance which proves the obstinacy of the contest, and justifies the observation of an ancient writer, that the forces of the empire were consumed in the fatal battle of Mursa, by the loss of a veteran army, sufficient to defend the frontiers, or to add new triumphs to the glory of Rome. Notwithstanding the invectives of a servile orator, there is not the least reason...", "...whole frame was agitated with convulsive passion, a large blood vessel suddenly burst in his body; and Valentinian fell speechless into the arms of his attendants.

The balloon was seen to penetrate the clouds, then to mount still higher, and finally to disappear entirely in five minutes <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> seconds from the time when it was set free. It was natural, after the experiments made long before with electric paper kites, to employ the balloon in the investigation of the electric conditions of the atmosphere.

There are two modes of nourishing the body, one is by food and the other by air. In the stomach the food is dissolved, and the nutritious portion is absorbed by the blood, and then is earned by blood-vessels to the lungs, where it receives oxygen from the air we breathe. This oxygen is as necessary to the nourishment of the body as the food for the stomach. In a full-grown man weighing one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> pounds, one hundred and eleven pounds consists of oxygen, obtained chiefly from the air we breathe.

With the like force, he threw himself into theology. In 1743, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> years old, what is called his illumination began. All his metallurgy, and transportation of ships overland, was absorbed into this ecstasy.

CALCULATION OF TIME; THE CALENDAR It is interesting to trace the beginnings of time reckoning and of that most important institution, the calendar. Most primitive tribes reckon time by the lunar month, the interval between two new moons (about twenty- nine days, twelve hours). Twelve lunar months give us the lunar year of about three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> days. In order to adapt such a year to the different seasons, the practice arose of inserting a thirteenth month from time to time. Such awkward calendars were used in antiquity by the Babylonians, Jews, and Greeks; in modern times by the Arabs and Chinese. The Egyptians were the only people in the Old World to frame a solar year. From the Egyptians it has come down, through the Romans, to us.

CALCULATION OF TIME; THE CALENDAR It is interesting to trace the beginnings of time reckoning and of that most important institution, the calendar. Most primitive tribes reckon time by the lunar month, the interval between two new moons (about twenty- nine days, twelve hours). Twelve lunar months give us the lunar year of about three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-four</span> days. In order to adapt such a year to the different seasons, the practice arose of inserting a thirteenth month from time to time. Such awkward calendars were used in antiquity by the Babylonians, Jews, and Greeks; in modern times by the Arabs and Chinese. The Egyptians were the only people in the Old World to frame a solar year. From the Egyptians it has come down, through the Romans, to us.
